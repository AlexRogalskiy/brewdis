Originating in Cologne (K\u00f6ln in German, both the dialect spoken and a person hailing from that city are called 'K\u00f6lsch'), K\u00f6lsch is a modern descendant of the Medieval Rhenish Ale brewed throughout the region north of Munich, a distinction it shares with the nearby Dusseld\u00f6rf Alt (you will hear more about this style in the near future). As demand for light colored beers grew, Cologne's brewers first developed a beer brewed mostly with wheat, quite similar to the German Weisse, called 'Keutebier'. Probably similar to a Belgian Wit, but lacking that beer's spices, Keutebier dominated brewing production in Cologne for almost 300 years. It wasn't until the 19th century that wheat started to disappear from the recipe, gradually replaced by Pilsner, until Keutebier had morphed into the modern K\u00f6lsch. 1906 is generally credited as the year modern K\u00f6lsch was first brewed by the S\u00fcnner Brewery. This new beer's popularity grew quickly, inspiring many brewers throughout the area to brew something similar. In 1946, the first agreement was signed by participating brewers that defined K\u00f6lsch. Throughout a turbulent history, many more agreements and legal battles have been waged until K\u00f6lsch was finally recognized by the EU with regional protections similar to those enjoyed by wine. Today a true K\u00f6lsch is brewed only in Cologne or the immediate area, but beers inspired by K\u00f6lsch are brewed all over the world. Clandestine's 'K\u00f6lsch I Can' is brewed with the same spirit as its German cousins: it is a subtle, malty, clean, crisp ale that has been lagered to reach peak flavors. Respectful of tradition, this beer is brewed only with German malts and hops. Soft water is used to push the malt flavors to the forefront of this still delicate beer. Just in time for hot weather, this is a perfect lawnmower beer!","abv":"5.3","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.04","createDate":"2014-06-06 16:53:08","updateDate":"2014-06-06 16:53:08","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).

We did not go noble with the hop profile but instead took it in a direction that paired better with the bready flavor of the pilsen and the touch of wheat grains that make up the back bone of this brew. This style is perfect on those hot summer days, but it\u2019s is also so refreshing that it is great anytime.
