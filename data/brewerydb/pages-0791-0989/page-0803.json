But apples in a beer? Wanting acidity to \u2018freshen\u2019 the beer and increase its drinkability and capacity to cellar, we thought apples would be best applied to the strong flavors of dark ales. The result is well worth discovery. It is our \u2018red wine\u2019 of ale and we recommend it be served in a wine glass, at room temperature with the meat dishes and cheeses normally accompanying such wines.\r\nOur Huon Dark Apple Ale starts as a rich and robust dark ale fermented with brewer\u2019s yeast. We then add up to 25% whole apple juice from Tasmania\u2019s pristine Huon Valley (or \u201cApple-HQ\u201d as we like to call it!) and re-ferment with a selected champagne yeast. Extended tank maturation pre-bottling, a third fermentation in bottle and, preferably, months of bottle-age completes a very individual ale of extremely complex character. This ale truly is a \u2018uniquely Tasmanian experience\u2019 and can be enjoyed now or will reward cellaring by developing more complexity with age.\u201d","abv":"6.5","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-19 13:54:49","updateDate":"2017-09-19 13:54:49","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:27","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:00","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
