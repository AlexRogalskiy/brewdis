If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

We are not trying to coin a beer style \u2013 we\u2019re just having fun.  The Jack D\u2019Or (pronounced \u201cJack Door\u201d), is at the very center of Pretty Things and nearly three years on we\u2019re still pleased as punch that he joined us!\r\n\r\nAs you know, PRETTY THINGS doesn\u2019t brew \u201cstyles\u201d per se.  Close, but we re-imagine everything and leave the style numbers in books on the shelves where they belong.  What that means is that while other people might be able to put our beers into a category, we have a hard time with it! Our beers are first and foremost creative beasts, not \u201ctypes\u201d of beer. Jack D\u2019Or is the kind of beer Martha and Dann like to drink before, after and during a great meal. Heck, we\u2019ll drink this sort of beer any time.\r\n\r\nOn Dann & Martha\u2019s honeymoon in France and Belgium they stashed quite a few cases of Wallonian beer into their trunk. Every night after setting up their tent they\u2019d cook lardons and lentils on a camp stove and enjoy fresh \u201csaison\u201d under the stars.\r\n\r\nInspired by some of our favorites like Saison DuPont, but also DeRanke\u2019s XX Bitter, De Dolle\u2019s Arabier, and local IPAs like Smuttynose, the Jack D\u2019Or starts off with North American Pils, Vienna, Wheat and Malted Oats (among others) and is hopped with a combination of four hops, finishing with Palisade and Nugget. The bitterness is the real backbone of the Jack D\u2019Or.  It\u2019s a proper \u201cplant-like\u201d bitterness with all of its jagged edges, beginning deep in the soil, then to the stem of this beer and up into to the very tippity heights.  Fermentation-wise we use a blend of four yeast strains to give Jack D\u2019Or its refreshingly dry character.  Finally, despite all of the spicy flavours in this beer it contains no actual spices \u2013 only malt, oats, rye, sugar, hops and yeast.  One more time: there are no spices or citrus in Jack D\u2019Or. Wheat lends acidity at Jack\u2019s edges, then rye and our blended yeast character come into play for a bit of polyphony, displeasing the notion of \u201cbalance\u201d and creating the fire in the belly of Jack D\u2019Or!\r\n\r\nThe creature on the label is Jack D\u2019Or himself, conceived and drawn by Dann. Far away in a small clearing in the woods of New England, ankle deep in the mash tun, he contemplates and conjures himself into a batch of beer. For those of you who are new to this, Jack is a grain of malted barley, but more than that: he is the unifying force behind all of the Pretty Things.
