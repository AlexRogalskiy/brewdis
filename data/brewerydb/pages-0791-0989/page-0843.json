At the Brewery Farm we love to grow hops, after several years of playing in the hops gardens, we found that these farm fresh hops will make outstanding fresh beers. We\u2019ve created 5 unique and classic beers to date, we challenged ourselves to complete the 6th, by carefully combining 4 of our bittering hops (Centennial, Sterling, Galena,Williamette) into a true IPA design - we nailed it. Subtle caramel malt provides enough sweetness to perfectly balance with an UNLEASHED bitterness of 48 B.U., within this bitterness is a citrus tone that moves almost to an orange finish. It\u2019s so good, this is a refreshing IPA (you won\u2019t hear that very often), that\u2019s drinkable and shareable.

IPApaya, the latest in our Pub Series, blends locally grown hops with notes of papaya for a vacation in a bottle. \r\n\r\nIPApaya was born out of our interest in the tropical aromas of Northwest hops. Pale and wheat malts along with healthy additions of Equinox and Cascade hops provide the perfect golden base for the addition of papaya. The result is a refreshing IPA with the subtle essence of papaya. Tropical aromas of citrus, passion fruit, and papaya are well complemented by clean malt notes. \r\n\r\nAvailable in 6-packs and on draft from January to April.\r\n\r\nFood pairings; Thai dishes such as Thai salad, pad prik king and tom kha, and Indian dishes such as curry, paneer and samosas. Light fruit-based desserts like Thai sticky rice topped with fresh mango and salted coconut milk. Light blue cheese or a nicely aged triple-creme brie.\r\n\r\nAbout the Pub Series: Like a portal to our pub, seasonal brews only available for a limited time (get \u2019em while they\u2019re cold) give you a taste of the pints and people that celebrate the Pacific Northwest.
