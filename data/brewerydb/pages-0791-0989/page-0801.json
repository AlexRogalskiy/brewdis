Our festbier lager has finally arrived! Named in honor of the beautiful view majestic Humpback Mountain offers our brewery to the Southwest, Humpbock is the quintessential Fall brew. Once served in Munich for the celebration of Crown Prince Ludwig\u2019s wedding, Oktoberfest lager (also called M\u00e4rzenbier, as it is brewed in March for a Fall release) has become a traditional September-October beer the world over. Our version uses the eponymous Munich malt in combination with Pils and Vienna malts and is hopped exclusively with the noble Hallertau variety hop. Deep malty flavors dominate this quaffable beer. 26 IBUs.","ibu":"26","glasswareId":3,"availableId":4,"styleId":82,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RFcNBH\/upload_2N2mlm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RFcNBH\/upload_2N2mlm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RFcNBH\/upload_2N2mlm-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RFcNBH\/upload_2N2mlm-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RFcNBH\/upload_2N2mlm-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RFcNBH\/upload_2N2mlm-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-04 23:24:38","updateDate":"2015-12-17 06:19:56","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":82,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Oktoberfest \/ Wiesen (Meadow)","shortName":"Oktoberfest","description":"Today's Oktoberfest beers are characterized by a medium body and light, golden color.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
