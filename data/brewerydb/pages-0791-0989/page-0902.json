A fruity aroma like an ale with a crisp, clean finish like a lager.","abv":"5","ibu":"20","glasswareId":5,"styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pairs with: chicken, salads, salmon, bratwurst, hot dogs, burgers, seafood, boiled crawfish and shrimp","createDate":"2014-06-27 13:24:13","updateDate":"2014-06-27 13:24:13","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).
