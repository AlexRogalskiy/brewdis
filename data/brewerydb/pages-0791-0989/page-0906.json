Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Then, during a hot summer day, Maso (at the time assistant brewer) presented me with a blind taste test.
