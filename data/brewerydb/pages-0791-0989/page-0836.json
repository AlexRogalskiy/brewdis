An innovative brewing process, special fermentations, and French oak barrel aging all contribute to a beer that has remarkable wine-like qualities. \r\n\r\nTwo yeast strains were used to create this unique 9.5% ABV Belgian style ale. The first, a Belgian farmhouse yeast, establishes the flavor foundations of a classic Belgian-style ale. The second, a house strain of Brettanomyces yeast, brings it to the next level contributing an intriguing myriad of flavors including pear, apricot, graham cracker, and bread crust. Finally, a portion of the Interlude is aged in French Merlot and Sirah oak barrels, which impart a distinctive vinous plum character and a drying, almost tannic finish. Try complementing its audacious character with food pairings such as sausages, salami, smoked meats, and bold cheeses.\r\n\r\nTrue to traditional Belgian-style brewing, we bottle condition the Interlude. Just prior to bottling, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast is added to the \u2018still beer\u2019 (at this stage there is no carbonation present). After bottling, the beer is aged in a warm room, where the fresh dose of yeast ferments the sugar and naturally carbonates the beer.","abv":"9.5","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2016,"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-05 14:28:50","updateDate":"2018-03-26 19:00:22","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.

Stepping past the heavier flavors appealing in the dead of winter, we arrive at the sprightlier flavors of spring and summer.

Pureed green apples from France are added to the fermentation in order to define the familiar acidity of a lactic sour, then the beer is \"dry-hopped\" on fresh wasabi roots. In Intermezzo, sweet and piquant whiffs of real wasabi cleanse the bright tartness of green apple while the nutty finish of the kernel of pale malt is left to eradicate winter's weight.
