As is true with all German wheat beers, hop bitterness is low and carbonation is high. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. It has a medium to full body. If dark, a mild roast malt character should emerge in flavor and to a lesser degree in the aroma. If this is served with yeast the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.9","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.066","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:15"}},{"id":"7Hw84t","name":"Lagartos","nameDisplay":"Lagartos","abv":"4.9","ibu":"40","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Hw84t\/upload_iIvsd2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Hw84t\/upload_iIvsd2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Hw84t\/upload_iIvsd2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-16 23:23:14","updateDate":"2018-07-17 15:01:25","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.
