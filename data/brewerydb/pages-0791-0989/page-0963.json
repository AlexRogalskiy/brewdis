When deciding what to make, we figured something excessively hoppy was the logical choice, and so this collaboration brew was born. This triple IPA is an intensely hoppy and bitter San Diego-style India pale ale. The light malt character and light body allow aggressive notes of pine, mango, and citrus fruits to overtake the palate, while a dry finish allows it to remain crisp and refreshing. Make the Logical Choice and enjoy this beer immediately, much like the brewers did leaving work to enjoy it in sunny San Diego.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"}},{"id":"unB8LZ","name":"London Bridge ESB","nameDisplay":"London Bridge ESB","abv":"5.4","ibu":"19","glasswareId":5,"srmId":12,"availableId":4,"styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.052","createDate":"2015-06-07 19:49:41","updateDate":"2015-06-08 14:43:04","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":12,"name":"12","hex":"CF6900"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.
