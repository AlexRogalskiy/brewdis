For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

Gordon Biersch Maibock achieves its rich malty flavor from dark roasted caramel malt, and lots of it. Originally brewed in the 14th century in the town of Einbeck, Germany, it quickly became a favorite style in Bavaria. One of the Bavarian brewers actually enticed a brewer from the North to move to Bavaria where the style was popularized. Maibock is a great beer to accompany robust flavors. The rich flavor from the dark-roasted caramel malt complements the moderate level of bitterness to create a perfect balance. Maibock is available seasonally from February through April.","abv":"7.3","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":89,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ouUm8w\/upload_8UQjrS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ouUm8w\/upload_8UQjrS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ouUm8w\/upload_8UQjrS-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ouUm8w\/upload_8UQjrS-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ouUm8w\/upload_8UQjrS-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ouUm8w\/upload_8UQjrS-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:39","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:31:28","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":89,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Heller Bock\/Maibock","shortName":"Maibock","description":"The German word helle means light colored, and as such, a heller Bock is light straw to deep golden in color.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"}},{"id":"ruCW0N","name":"Maibock","nameDisplay":"Maibock","description":"Big and malty.
