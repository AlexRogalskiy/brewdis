This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors.

Fresh Hop IPA is a citrus punch of the green stuff: Amarillo, Centennial and Cascade hops straight off the vine.  This brazen and deliciously bitter IPA pours deeply golden with the slight haze of a really hoppy beer. The fresh hops poke you right in the nose and the liquid hits your tongue with a sharp blast, finishing light and dry.  This is the hop harvest, in a glass, just for you.","abv":"7","ibu":"79","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:14","updateDate":"2019-08-04 13:53:46","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"}},{"id":"8VcLWa","name":"Lips of Faith - Nitro Salted Belgian Chocolate Stout","nameDisplay":"Lips of Faith - Nitro Salted Belgian Chocolate Stout","abv":"9","ibu":"35","availableId":2,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8VcLWa\/upload_07W3vo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8VcLWa\/upload_07W3vo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8VcLWa\/upload_07W3vo-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8VcLWa\/upload_07W3vo-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8VcLWa\/upload_07W3vo-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8VcLWa\/upload_07W3vo-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-17 15:17:48","updateDate":"2019-08-04 13:18:55","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"}}],"status":"success"}
