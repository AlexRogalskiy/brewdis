The year 2000 was an anniversary year as it was 470 years from the time of the first written report of the brewery. The brewery prepared special variants and recipes throughout the year e.g. to Christmas under the name Sv\u00e1te\u010dn\u00ed Lager for this significant event. \r\n\r\nTaste: it has an excellent taste similar to Tas beer, with a subtle to slightly insensitive bitterness which slowly disappears after drinking. In contrast to Tas beer it is crisper and its color ranges from golden yellow to a shade of golden brown. The biggest difference is its fullness because the higher degrees Pluto give this beer a fuller taste, which can be described as being bready.","abv":"4.8","glasswareId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":76,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CE5TAm\/upload_mI7KVD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CE5TAm\/upload_mI7KVD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CE5TAm\/upload_mI7KVD-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CE5TAm\/upload_mI7KVD-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CE5TAm\/upload_mI7KVD-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CE5TAm\/upload_mI7KVD-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 13:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:49:56","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color.
