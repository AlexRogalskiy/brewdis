Bright and tropical hops dominate the aroma, but are quickly followed by a deep, biscuity malt character. The flavor is fruity and slightly caramel, with a bright honey-like note and a lingering touch of sweetness.

Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"}},{"id":"7oRJoF","name":"Knuckle Dragger","nameDisplay":"Knuckle Dragger","description":"This aggressively hopped Strong Pale Ale is a Walking Man original.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"100","styleId":29,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-19 20:35:27","updateDate":"2015-03-19 20:35:27","style":{"id":29,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Strong Pale Ale","shortName":"American Strong Pale","description":"American strong pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

To the tune of over 2 pounds per barrel! \u201cAre you SERIOUS?\u201d you ask. Well hells yeah we\u2019re serious!!! These bitter hop overloards command you to bow down at the altar of aroma!
