Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery\/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QbZbCr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1221 East Pike Street","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98122","phone":"206-860-3977","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","latitude":47.614033,"longitude":-122.315716,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"7S4DH1","name":"TangleTown","streetAddress":"2106 N 55th St, Seattle, WA 98103","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"206-547-5929","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM","latitude":47.668918,"longitude":-122.333473,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DN6vry","name":"Ambush IPA","nameDisplay":"Ambush IPA","abv":"7.3","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-09 13:59:32","updateDate":"2017-04-09 13:59:32","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

We hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n93 IBU","abv":"11.1","styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 20:45:34","updateDate":"2018-06-25 15:52:00","style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness. Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.

It\u2019s a beer for beer lovers.","abv":"5","ibu":"25","availableId":1,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PEO582\/upload_oTy91P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PEO582\/upload_oTy91P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PEO582\/upload_oTy91P-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PEO582\/upload_oTy91P-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PEO582\/upload_oTy91P-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PEO582\/upload_oTy91P-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 11:46:08","updateDate":"2016-11-30 05:00:29","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

The taproom features a sailing yacht\u2019s binnacle (sailboat steering wheel, pedestal, compass, guard with cup holder for glassware, and fold-out teak table with cushioned bench-style seating around it) for you and your friends and family to enjoy.","website":"http:\/\/www.pilothousebrewco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W9miCU\/upload_oqR5F0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W9miCU\/upload_oqR5F0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W9miCU\/upload_oqR5F0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W9miCU\/upload_oqR5F0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W9miCU\/upload_oqR5F0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:49:14","updateDate":"2019-08-09 14:22:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"BZXGD38OJL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mUuNTn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4233 South Buckley Road","locality":"Aurora","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80013","phone":"(303) 994-4971","website":"http:\/\/www.pilothousebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 3:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 3:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 2:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 9:00 PM","latitude":39.6402993,"longitude":-104.7928939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:49:16","updateDate":"2018-08-17 18:49:16","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 3:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 3:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 2:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 9:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VC2hKy","name":"American Apple","nameDisplay":"American Apple","abv":"6.5","styleId":149,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-02-27 14:43:05","updateDate":"2019-02-27 14:43:05","style":{"id":149,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Common Cider","shortName":"Common Cider","description":"Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.

They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place\/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:45:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:04:40","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DYK2HE3MXW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"hMvwjg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4500 5th Ave South","extendedAddress":"Building C","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"205-578-2616","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","latitude":33.526729,"longitude":-86.764854,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:46:42","updateDate":"2016-02-02 17:43:17","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
