This beer is commonly over looked and is a true Ninja of a beer. While the malt and hops give this beer an amazing copper color, medium body, and a smooth mouth feel, it's the yeast that sets this one apart from other amber ales. Inspired by almost everything from Belgium (beer, women, mussels) we thought it would be cool to give our Amber a little Belgian love. So we used a yeast that is ALMOST like a Belgian yeast strain. You'll notice it in the aroma but mostly in the flavor.

When Aaron Maas moved to Plumtree, NC in 2009 as an avid home brewer, the dream to open a brewery slowly moved towards reality.  After 3 painstaking years, the brewery finally opened in July of 2012.  We are excited to be able to live in such a wonderful place and still have the ability to follow our passions.  Come out to Plumtree so we can prove to you that we\u2019re nuts about beer!!","website":"http:\/\/www.blindsquirrelbrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gHtsql\/upload_nX4QyQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gHtsql\/upload_nX4QyQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gHtsql\/upload_nX4QyQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gHtsql\/upload_nX4QyQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gHtsql\/upload_nX4QyQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 11:25:47","updateDate":"2019-06-04 15:34:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GL8OQS61WR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fXrQIm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4716 South US Hwy 19E","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Plumtree","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28664","phone":"828-765-BREW","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday & Thursday - 11:00am- 8:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday- 11:00am - 10:00pm\r\nClosed Sunday","latitude":36.027199,"longitude":-82.009252,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 11:28:04","updateDate":"2019-06-04 15:34:05","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wednesday & Thursday - 11:00am- 8:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday- 11:00am - 10:00pm\r\nClosed Sunday","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":22,"name":"Cascade","description":"Cascade was created in the United States as an open-pollinated cross between Fuggle and Serebrianker.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","established":"1994","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001uBxRG66eq3ajbdfZ6GjL91di7O20EmmX","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:42:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IMU3ZJH0NL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jPbb33","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2000 Lyons Avenue","locality":"Houston","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77020","phone":"713-686-9494","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","latitude":29.7715192,"longitude":-95.3484972,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hp3Cco","name":"Amber Ale - Four+ Series","nameDisplay":"Amber Ale - Four+ Series","abv":"5","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hp3Cco\/upload_wGX3nj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hp3Cco\/upload_wGX3nj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hp3Cco\/upload_wGX3nj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hp3Cco\/upload_wGX3nj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hp3Cco\/upload_wGX3nj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hp3Cco\/upload_wGX3nj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-10 11:04:31","updateDate":"2015-12-17 11:28:05","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
