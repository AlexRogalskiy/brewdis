There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"pNatE6","name":"Penrose Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Penrose","description":"Art, Science, and Belgian-Inspired Brewing in Geneva, IL. \r\n\r\nThis began with a shared obsession for skillfully brewed beer, and the starved need for cultural redirection of our lifework.

For us a strong foundation of dedication to trades such as mechanics, ironwork and carpentry was laid early in life. With the love of these trades the need to create was always a must and that is what brings us to this point of wanting to share our beers with the public. We never focus on pleasing just one style since we love just about all of them and while not every beer we brew will be the perfect student in its category it will be one that will get the craft beer loving palate craving more with each sip.","website":"http:\/\/chainreactionbrewingco.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-23 11:26:33","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:15:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WZN7KMB4PF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"iYshKM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"902 S Lipan St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80223","phone":"1-303-922-0960","website":"http:\/\/chainreactionbrewingco.com","latitude":39.6995433,"longitude":-105.0012001,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-23 11:27:11","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:50:06","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JiFDvq","name":"Belgian Saison","nameDisplay":"Belgian Saison","abv":"5","ibu":"19.1","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-22 22:42:30","updateDate":"2017-03-06 19:56:13","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Aroma\/Flavor hops are most commonly used to employ a flavor balance that is only low in bitterness. Traditional versions do not use artificial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions of this beer incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to a perception of smoothness. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in barely perceptible amounts, but this is not common. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused.
