A combination that guarantees high quality. It is quality that is the basis of Zeunerts\u2019 business. The Bavarian art of brewing is without a doubt the finest in the world. As early as 1859, Christoffer August Zeunert introduced copper vats and open fermenting tubs in production and the tradition of ageing the beer to the perfect maturity and flavour. It goes without saying that we follow the German Beer Purity Laws.\r\n\r\n ONLY FIRST-CLASS RAW MATERIALS WILL DO HERE\r\n\r\nWe are extremely careful about raw materials. The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer. At least that was the opinion of Christoffer August Zeunert. Hops are the spice of beer. The little hop cones contain the hundreds of flavours that give beer its bitterness, flavour and aroma.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

One of the defining characteristics of the beer was that the brewers had to use ingredients available in America. The malt was domestic six-row instead of the more refined two-row used in Europe. The smaller barley corns resulted in more husk material being included in the mash, causing a harsher and more grainy character. To smooth out the flavor the brewers utilized an adjunct, either flaked corn or flaked rice. The other difference was the use of domestic hops, primarily Cluster, which was not as refined as the \u201cnoble\u201d varieties of Germany. The differences gave the original American Pilsner its own unique character. These were substantial beers with moderately high maltiness, medium to high hop flavor, and medium to high hop bitterness. The beers featuring flaked corn exhibited a distinctive sweetness, while the beers with rice were clean and crisp. 1872 Lager uses flaked corn as its adjunct and for historical accuracy Cluster hops. This is your Great-Grandpa\u2019s pilsner.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like flavors are subtly present. Fruited versions will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters. Hop flavor is evident over a full range from low to high. Hop bitterness is evident over a full range from low to high. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic and light to moderate and\/or fruity acidic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms may be evident, not dominant and in balance with other character. Cultured yeast strains may be used in the fermentation. Beers in this style should not use bacteria or exhibit bacteria-derived characters. Moderate to intense yet balanced fruity-ester flavors are evident. Diacetyl and DMS flavors should not be perceived. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Body is evident over a full range from low to high. For purposes of competition entries exhibiting wood-derived characters or characters of liquids previously aged in wood would more appropriately be entered in other Wood-Aged Beer categories. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales should not be entered here and are classified elsewhere.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:04:16"},"breweries":[{"id":"nN4dSc","name":"Brasserie St. James","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie St. James","description":"We make beers for all palates. A lot of our beers have been lovingly referred to as so finely crafted that they seem to be made for a serious wine drinkers palate. A saying goes in wine making, \"it takes a lot of good beer to make good wine...\". The point being, we make complex, delicate, nuanced beers, not just the same typical west coast hop bombs or dark extremely high alcohol brews (though we make quality versions of those too). Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only \"The people's beverage\", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA. You would be hard pressed to find anyone more passionate and knowledgeable about beer than myself or my brewer Josh Watterson. We welcome you to come down to our weekly brewery tours, and discuss all things beer, food, wine, or whatever be the topic of the day!","website":"http:\/\/brasseriesaintjames.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nN4dSc\/upload_FEvlDK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nN4dSc\/upload_FEvlDK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nN4dSc\/upload_FEvlDK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nN4dSc\/upload_FEvlDK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nN4dSc\/upload_FEvlDK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:00:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"16DUA87PNM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"WxtiJC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1300 Clough Road","locality":"Reno","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89509","phone":"323-309-0799","latitude":39.507752,"longitude":-119.832957,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gKlJgP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"901 S.
