In our Garage, you can find what drives us \u2014 quality craft beer.\r\n\r\n\u200bEstablished in 2013, we began brewing in what was once an eight bay garage at the end of Old Town Temecula. The brewpub and taproom was aptly named Garage Brewing Co, not only due to its previous life, but to show an appreciation to where the craft beer industry originated \u2014 in the garages of brewers. Here, we have created a family-friendly environment where our fast-fired, Kustom-built pizzas and quality, Kustom craft beers provide unlimited possibilities of flavor while bringing friends and family together. In 2016, we expanded our business and now also have an off-site, full production brewery in Murrieta, CA.\r\n\r\n\u200bFrom the beginning, we set out on a mission: to provide top-quality craft beer that tastes fantastic and appeals to a broad spectrum of beer lovers. We are committed to excellence and only use the finest ingredients, state-of-the art equipment, and top-notch coding processes.\r\n\r\n\u200bWe maintain six core, year-round styles while also regularly rotating in seasonal creations for a total of \u00b1 15 beers on tap at all times.  As an independent brewery, we are free to modify beer recipes and develop exciting and creative spins on standard styles to please all types of beer advocates.  We routinely offer new and interesting beers to bring our customers a truly unique experience. \r\n \r\nOur brewery equipment was manufacured in North America by a company that has built over 350 breweries and has over 25 years of experience in the craft brewing industry. This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves an exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:24:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:47:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYX5KUDZEG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Jki0lE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29095 Old Town Front Street","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 587-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":33.4825051,"longitude":-117.1432478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pSKthM","name":"Belgian-Style White Ale","nameDisplay":"Belgian-Style White Ale","abv":"5","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/pSKthM\/upload_Ntqc6N-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/pSKthM\/upload_Ntqc6N-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/pSKthM\/upload_Ntqc6N-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/pSKthM\/upload_Ntqc6N-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/pSKthM\/upload_Ntqc6N-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/pSKthM\/upload_Ntqc6N-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-09 15:14:06","updateDate":"2015-12-17 09:35:14","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo raise your glass in a toast to progress; It\u2019s time to bring brewing back to Buffalo!","website":"http:\/\/www.newbuffalobrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-21 18:02:29","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"x0saIe","name":"Office","streetAddress":"P.O.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.
