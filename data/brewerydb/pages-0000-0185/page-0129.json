Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"43Q9bu","name":"Medusa Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Medusa","website":"http:\/\/www.medusabrewing.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/43Q9bu\/upload_wRl3R2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/43Q9bu\/upload_wRl3R2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/43Q9bu\/upload_wRl3R2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/43Q9bu\/upload_wRl3R2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/43Q9bu\/upload_wRl3R2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-14 20:58:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:27:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KSL4I1WF2O","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"70OAlN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"111 Main St.","locality":"Hudson","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01749","phone":"+1 (978) 310-1933","website":"http:\/\/www.medusabrewing.com","latitude":42.3909502,"longitude":-71.5667688,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-14 20:58:10","updateDate":"2017-08-22 17:07:35","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"A65bCN","name":"Baroque Belgique","nameDisplay":"Baroque Belgique","abv":"7","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A65bCN\/upload_Fs6J6f-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A65bCN\/upload_Fs6J6f-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A65bCN\/upload_Fs6J6f-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A65bCN\/upload_Fs6J6f-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A65bCN\/upload_Fs6J6f-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A65bCN\/upload_Fs6J6f-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-12 18:50:21","updateDate":"2018-03-12 18:51:04","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

The liquid was produced, aged and packaged in Atwater\u2019s Detroit brewery, making it one of the only barrel aged beers produced entirely in Detroit.","abv":"11","ibu":"24","availableId":2,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/1B70BF\/upload_EAgTt9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/1B70BF\/upload_EAgTt9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/1B70BF\/upload_EAgTt9-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/1B70BF\/upload_EAgTt9-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/1B70BF\/upload_EAgTt9-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/1B70BF\/upload_EAgTt9-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-02-06 17:40:22","updateDate":"2019-02-06 17:40:50","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"0Lhdch","name":"Hermitage Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Hermitage","description":"Hermitage Brewing Company (HBC ) is a Silicon Valley native.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"4MVtcc","name":"The Bruery","nameShortDisplay":"The Bruery","description":"A boutique craft brewery located in Orange County, California specializing in experimental and barrel aged beer.

From hopped up American IPAs to Belgian-Style Ales, we're brewing the kind of beer that we love to drink, and we're looking forward to sharing it with everbody who's willing to join us.","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-13 17:12:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:27:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CR4JG12LNA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"VAj3CW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8700 W. 47th St.","locality":"Lyons","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60534","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com\/brewery\/","latitude":41.8060004,"longitude":-87.8370967,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 18:28:06","updateDate":"2015-01-14 20:24:00","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-12:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6XFUIz","name":"Barrel Aged B.O.R.I.S.

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal.
