All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"x8kqVp","name":"Southern Tier Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Southern Tier","description":"Southern Tier Brewing Company was founded in 2004 by Phineas DeMink and Allen Yahn with the vision of bringing small batch brewing back to a region rich in brewing tradition.

An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA.

Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"11gqIZ","name":"Atlanta Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Atlanta","description":"Atlanta Brewing Co is dedicated to brewing innovative beers, focusing on quality, and utilizing regional ingredients whenever possible.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

Right now we like to drink more sessionable styles: hoppy pale ales, Berliner weisses, low ABV saison, and other easy-drinkers. We plan to lean on these styles for our core beers. However, one thing we absolutely believe to be true is that the public will be choosing our \u201ccore\u201d beers for us: if you like the beer, we will keep brewing it.\r\nWe\u2019re going to have an extensive barrel-aged program as well, especially for sour beers.\r\n\r\nWe definitely hate being boring and doing boring stuff so you can look forward to experimentation and unique projects.","website":"http:\/\/angrychairbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VCOezh\/upload_tvzrYh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VCOezh\/upload_tvzrYh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VCOezh\/upload_tvzrYh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VCOezh\/upload_tvzrYh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VCOezh\/upload_tvzrYh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-28 00:07:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:16:57","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0SXUJVCDTA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"GN1WbX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6401 N Florida Ave","locality":"Tampa","region":"Florida","postalCode":"33604","phone":"(813) 892-1651","website":"http:\/\/angrychairbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 9:00pm","latitude":28.005142,"longitude":-82.459215,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-29 23:31:35","updateDate":"2016-07-07 19:51:33","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
