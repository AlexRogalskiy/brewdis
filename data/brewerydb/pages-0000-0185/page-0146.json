They were intrigued by the thought of building his brewery, but after much discussion, they decided they wanted to build a brewery that would reflect more of themselves. They embarked on a research road trip to the \u201cbeer capitol,\u201d Denver, Colorado, for some inspiration. There, they developed the vision of Prairie Sun Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter 19 months their vision became a reality as they took their passion and hard work, and brewed their first batch of beer on a 10-barrel system. Starting a business is no easy task\u2026starting a craft brewery is even tougher. Luckily, they were able to find most of the equipment needed to make it happen from Hogs Head Brewery in St. Albert, Alberta. In May 2013, Heather and Cameron found the perfect home at the former \u201cSaskatoon Bakery\u201d and they moved in! By June 2015, Prairie Sun had grown to 12 employees and could be found in many restaurants around Saskatoon. Heather and Cameron look forward to sharing their tasty beer with everyone in this community.","website":"http:\/\/www.prairiesun.ca\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-04 04:01:42","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8vBYrZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2020 Quebec St.","locality":"Saskatoon","region":"Saskatchewan","postalCode":"S7K 1W5","phone":"+1 306-343-7000","website":"http:\/\/www.prairiesun.ca","latitude":52.1572664,"longitude":-106.6627955,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-04 04:01:43","updateDate":"2017-08-23 02:39:57","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"3:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-11:00am-7:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-3:00pm,mon-11:00am-7:00pm,tue-11:00am-7:00pm,wed-11:00am-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Regina","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JCb4IX","name":"Batch 9000","nameDisplay":"Batch 9000","description":"Bottle: Unfiltered.\n\nA commemorative brew.\n\nMalt beverage brewed with molasses and brewer\u2019s licorice.\n\nBatch 9,000 Ale offers up aromas ranging from the sweet caramel &amp; molasses of dark rum to fruits such as raisins and plums.

Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
