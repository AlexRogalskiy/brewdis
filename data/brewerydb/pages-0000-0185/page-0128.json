Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"Q1n2wz","name":"Triton Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Triton","description":"Operated by its member-managers, Jon W.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"kHWJoD","name":"EJ Phair Brewing Company and Alehouse","nameShortDisplay":"EJ Phair Brewing Company and Alehouse","website":"http:\/\/www.ejphair.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kHWJoD\/upload_GnEaMg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kHWJoD\/upload_GnEaMg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kHWJoD\/upload_GnEaMg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kHWJoD\/upload_GnEaMg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kHWJoD\/upload_GnEaMg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZY8O03EHG1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ayEBYP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"300 Cumberand St","locality":"Pittsburg","region":"California","postalCode":"94565","phone":"9254277204","website":"http:\/\/www.ejphair.com\/","latitude":38.033018,"longitude":-121.882514,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:27:36","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ia4WMp","name":"Concord Alehouse","streetAddress":"2151 Salvio Street","extendedAddress":"Suite L","locality":"Concord","region":"California","postalCode":"94520","phone":"925-691-4253","website":"http:\/\/www.ejphair.com\/EJ_Phair_Brewing_Company\/Concord.html","latitude":37.9778694,"longitude":-122.0342774,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-11 14:34:15","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:34:15","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-10:00am-11:00pm,sun-10:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ltPe3W","name":"Barock Hell","nameDisplay":"Barock Hell","description":"Das Bier f\u00fcr den t\u00e4glichen Genuss. \r\n\r\nLeicht aber volumin\u00f6s im Geschmack mit ausgepr\u00e4gter Konsistenz und \u00fcppigen Aromen mit barocken Ankl\u00e4ngen; eine Weltenburger Spitzenqualit\u00e4t in Bezug auf Geruch, Geschmack, Aussehen und Bek\u00f6mmlichkeit.","styleId":86,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-21 18:25:35","updateDate":"2015-05-21 18:25:35","style":{"id":86,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bamberg-Style Helles Rauchbier","shortName":"Helles Rauchbier","description":"Helles Rauchbier should have beech wood smoky characters that range from detectable to prevalent in the aroma and flavor.

The unique combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria fermentation yields a beer that is acidic, highly attenuated, and very light bodied. The carbonation of a Berliner Weisse is high, and hop rates are very low. Clarity may be hazy or cloudy from yeast or chill haze. Hop character should not be perceived. Fruity esters will be evident. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"},"breweries":[{"id":"zDKM9Q","name":"Scarlet Lane Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Scarlet Lane","description":"Scarlet Lane Brewing Company\u2019s mission is to be your humble brewer promoting knowledge and continued betterment in the art of beer making.
