The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"pp1OW5","name":"Zebulon Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Zebulon","description":"We are a small production brewery with a sweet little tasting area that is open on Fridays and Saturdays from 1-6 pm.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.\r\n\r\nWe have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.","website":"http:\/\/www.goodpeoplebrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:24:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"C7N3FGZSB0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"pj4HJk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"114 14th Street South","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35223","website":"http:\/\/www.goodpeoplebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Taproom Hours\r\nWednesday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nThursday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nFriday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nSaturday: 1pm - 4pm","latitude":33.50713,"longitude":-86.811894,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Taproom Hours\r\nWednesday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nThursday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nFriday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nSaturday: 1pm - 4pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XbQ89g","name":"Batch #6","nameDisplay":"Batch #6","description":"murti)\r\n\r\nThis is a historical recreation of what the original IPA tasted like back when it was actually shipped to India.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"BAUlXz","name":"Venn Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Venn","description":"3550 E. 46TH ST SUITE #140, MPLS, MN 55406\r\nLocated along the Blue Line Light Rail.","website":"https:\/\/www.vennbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BAUlXz\/upload_k76rsy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BAUlXz\/upload_k76rsy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BAUlXz\/upload_k76rsy-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BAUlXz\/upload_k76rsy-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BAUlXz\/upload_k76rsy-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-13 13:25:02","updateDate":"2019-07-02 13:57:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WYCEG49O3Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EVJos2","name":"Venn Brewing","streetAddress":"3550 E. 46TH ST SUITE #140","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55406","website":"https:\/\/www.vennbrewing.com","latitude":44.9201983,"longitude":-93.220336,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-17 20:53:01","updateDate":"2018-01-17 20:53:01","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-11:00pm,thu-3:00pm-11:00pm,fri-2:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am,sun-12:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oBObPl","name":"Batch #6: Barrel Aged Coffee Oatmeal Stout (County Line Ales)","nameDisplay":"Batch #6: Barrel Aged Coffee Oatmeal Stout (County Line Ales)","description":"GPBC's traditional Coffee Oatmeal Stout aged in a Tennessee Whiskey barrel.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
