It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"fbCdt8","name":"Throwback Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Throwback","description":"Throwback is a small, inspired brewery dedicated to crafting delicious, farm-fresh beers from local ingredients.

It was sometimes rough around the edges, but that's what made this serious business so exciting, all in the name of giving beer enthusiasts something original and authentic.\r\n\r\nDuring Prohibition, the true innovators transported their concoctions in unmarked mason jars nicknamed \"pigs\". It is one of the technologies that contributed to Chicago's unique and infamous beer brewing past emboldening us with the spirit and dedication of those original trailblazers to create new and interesting beers just as those original innovators intended.\r\n\r\nIt's in the spirit of determined novelty that we find our source of inspiration. We carry on the tradition of finding nuanced ways to bring interesting tastes to beer lovers through experimentation. We've learned to embrace that moment when a beer comes out truly novel. Even in its early days, innovation in the beer and spirit worlds revolved around the fearless ability to be a little different all in the name of providing beer lovers with something new and interesting to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe've been delivering on that promise since February, 21st, 2013 when our brew kettle fired up its inaugural beer. Contentious, an IPA Fermented with Belgian yeast, created a slightly spicy brew with a shockingly enormous hop presence. Since that first brew, we have worked diligently to provide a wide range of beer for all to enjoy.\r\n\r\nToday our brew master focuses on pushing traditional lager techniques and continuing to brew award-winning beer. While we brew some German-style beers like our Shamefaced Pilsner and our Hook & Hatchet Vienna-style Lager, we also push for extremely clean IPAs, American reds, and a variety of others. We encourage you to join us as we dream up our own modern day innovations.","website":"https:\/\/midnightpig.co\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_lreUnx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_lreUnx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_lreUnx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_lreUnx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_lreUnx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:25:50","updateDate":"2019-09-24 14:28:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F2R9T46KWH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"OR1ggJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12337 South Rt. 59","locality":"Plainfield","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60585","phone":"(815) 436-3900","website":"http:\/\/www.nevinsbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.656777,"longitude":-88.202701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:26:36","updateDate":"2019-09-24 14:28:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"60j0t1","name":"Ambers Back In Town","nameDisplay":"Ambers Back In Town","description":"A Colorado reminiscent style Amber Ale.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y1yCgh","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Run","description":"Crooked Run Brewing is an award winning small brewery located in Sterling, Virginia, with an original nanobrewery located in Leesburg, Virginia","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:20:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:22:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HPJZNL1S6Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"gssG96","name":"Brewery\/Bar","streetAddress":"205 Harrison Street","locality":"Leesburg","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20175","phone":"(571) 918-4446","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.1127672,"longitude":-77.5625836,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:21:48","updateDate":"2017-04-04 17:53:04","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xpgL0V","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","streetAddress":"22455 Davis Dr, suite 120","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20164","phone":"571-375-2652","website":"crookedrunbrewing.com","latitude":38.9947623,"longitude":-77.4231583,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-03 20:00:27","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:29:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6UB5cu","name":"Ambrosia","nameDisplay":"Ambrosia","description":"Brewed with Orange & Hibiscus, there's a citrus snap that melds with Hibiscus sweetness and warm malt tones.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"lZfiot","name":"Half Acre Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Half Acre","description":"Half Acre Beer Co. is a brewing company in the Northcenter neighborhood of Chicago, IL.
