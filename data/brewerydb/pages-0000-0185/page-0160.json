Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"AqEUBQ","name":"New Holland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"New Holland","description":"New Holland Brewing Company\u2019s deep roots in the craft industry go back to 1997.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

As we only have the deepest respect for Vermont breweries we suggested turning the brewing day into an actual collaboration day, and a recipe was developed via email with one of the brewery\u2019s masterminds Christophe Gagne. Bees For My Honey is a tribute to a product that is local to both breweries, a wonderful product that we both hold in high regard: honey! And it\u2019s also a tribute to those wonderful buzzing little aviators called the honey bees. A friendly lil creature we have been taking for granted for way too long, only to realize that they seem to be abandoning us in recent years.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:54:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8tHhXL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Fugleb\u00e6kvej 2 C","region":"Kastrup","postalCode":"2770","phone":"+45 32 50 62 00 \u200e","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","latitude":55.624252,"longitude":12.595661,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DK","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:55:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DK","name":"DENMARK","displayName":"Denmark","isoThree":"DNK","numberCode":208,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"Y8stOS","name":"Hermit Thrush Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Hermit Thrush","website":"http:\/\/www.hermitthrushbrewery.com\/","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"INFO@HERMITTHRUSHBREWERY.COM","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-23 18:43:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:48:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"74PASEMJBQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S31L0E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29 High St.","extendedAddress":"Suite 101C","locality":"Brattleboro","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05301","latitude":42.8534875,"longitude":-72.5596126,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-24 18:17:17","updateDate":"2015-08-24 18:17:17","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NMCadp","name":"Bees in the Trappe","nameDisplay":"Bees in the Trappe","abv":"8","styleId":71,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NMCadp\/upload_55qXcb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NMCadp\/upload_55qXcb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NMCadp\/upload_55qXcb-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NMCadp\/upload_55qXcb-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NMCadp\/upload_55qXcb-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NMCadp\/upload_55qXcb-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 13:07:54","updateDate":"2015-12-17 10:55:26","style":{"id":71,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French-Style Bi\u00e8re de Garde","shortName":"Bi\u00e8re de Garde","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep copper or light brown in color.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer \u2013 Scott Vincent \u2013 leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NorULV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"89 Bertie Street,","locality":"Port Melbourne","region":"VIC","postalCode":"3207","phone":"(03) 9673 4545","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","hoursOfOperation":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","latitude":-37.8286099,"longitude":144.9371032,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"t5xaRE","name":"Beez Nutz","nameDisplay":"Beez Nutz","description":"Let's just agree that hazelnuts and honey are a perfect pair, so it was only natural we put them in a beer together.

The artist Robert Motherwell once said \"A subject emerges from an interaction between my self, my I, and my medium.\" This is the same process we employ in the creation of our beers. Each beer is born out of a free flowing of ideas; a collaborative exchange of concepts between intellectual thesis and recipe. This then leads to lots of pilot brewing which often leads to further discussion of concept until ultimately either the beer style is determined by the concept or vice versa. This process allows for a great amount of freedom and creativity to already be present at the beginning of every new project.","website":"http:\/\/www.rexxreserve.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bb8GTP","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-27 17:41:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EzrIDK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1203 New Windsor Rd.","locality":"Westminster","region":"Maryland","phone":"(410) 861-0415","latitude":39.555824,"longitude":-77.041126,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-28 16:38:00","updateDate":"2015-05-28 16:38:00","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"181JoY","name":"Beglo","nameDisplay":"Beglo","description":"IPA with Simcoe.","abv":"6","ibu":"58","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/181JoY\/upload_6veBnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/181JoY\/upload_6veBnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/181JoY\/upload_6veBnX-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/181JoY\/upload_6veBnX-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/181JoY\/upload_6veBnX-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/181JoY\/upload_6veBnX-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-07 15:54:28","updateDate":"2018-06-26 05:00:30","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
