In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a top fermented beer which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with Dubbel and Tripel in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced Blond. Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called Enkel.

Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District. The Railyard area is a busy arts and entertainment district, where you can find a different show, market or exhibit every day of the week. Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KUOVeU","name":"Bavarian Lager","nameDisplay":"Bavarian Lager","description":"Golden lager with bright citrus notes.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"18","styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KUOVeU\/upload_q2BBOV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KUOVeU\/upload_q2BBOV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KUOVeU\/upload_q2BBOV-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KUOVeU\/upload_q2BBOV-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KUOVeU\/upload_q2BBOV-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KUOVeU\/upload_q2BBOV-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-04-24 19:05:16","updateDate":"2019-04-24 19:06:24","style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0LZvV1","name":"Bavarian Prince Oktoberfest","nameDisplay":"Bavarian Prince Oktoberfest","description":"A classic Marzen style Oktoberfest with deep amber color, European malty flavors and aromas with a balanced floral hop character.

A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing. This brewery celebrates determination, knowledge, and the humble pride we wave like a battle flag.","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonBrewingCompany\/app_100265896690345?ref=page_internal","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:09:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:36:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"G851P7EZKA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"JZyJiP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 W. 7th","locality":"Covington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41011","phone":"859-261-5600","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","latitude":39.0829077,"longitude":-84.5109181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 17:33:55","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:29:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LgDR9B","name":"Braxton Labs","streetAddress":"95 Riviera Dr.","locality":"Bellevue","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41073","phone":"859-291-0036","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonLabs\/","latitude":39.1001948,"longitude":-84.4877355,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","updateDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SanbUo","name":"Bavarian Table Beer","nameDisplay":"Bavarian Table Beer","description":"Epicly crushable low-ABV session beer brewed with pils\/oats\/wheat\/rye and German-grown Hallertau Blanc and Mandarina Bavarian hops.
