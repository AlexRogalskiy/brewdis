When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:03:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4T1VLSO75B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TkT8Rc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bgmiT2","name":"Best Bitter","nameDisplay":"Best Bitter","description":"Brewed in the English Best Bitter style, the combination of 5 malts gives Sprig & Fern's Best Bitter the ideal balance of malt sweetness with the addition of Crystal and Caramalt giving the beer its rounded toffee and biscuit character.","abv":"5","styleId":4,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-27 18:18:41","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:18:41","style":{"id":4,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Special Bitter or Best Bitter","shortName":"Special Bitter","description":"Special bitter is more robust than ordinary bitter.

We call it 'Real Live Beer' and encourage you to keep it well refrigerated to maintain quality and freshness.","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","mailingListUrl":"info@sprigandfern.co.nz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"VWuTZv","name":"Tinakori Road Sprig & Fern Tavern","streetAddress":"342 Tinakori Rd","locality":"Thorndon","region":"Wellington","postalCode":"6011","phone":"04 499 1390","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandferntaverns.co.nz\/taverns\/tinakori-road-wellington","latitude":-41.2788229,"longitude":174.7691029,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:20","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:01:49","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7QJgg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"53 Beach Road","locality":"Richmond","region":"Nelson","postalCode":"7020","phone":"03 544 8675","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","latitude":-41.3337821,"longitude":173.1860035,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-27 18:04:29","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:06:29","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"4:30pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"4:30pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"4:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-12:00pm-4:30pm,wed-12:00pm-4:30pm,thu-12:00pm-4:30pm,fri-12:00pm-6:00pm,sat-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MGSUT9","name":"Best Bitter","nameDisplay":"Best Bitter","description":"A classic, Best Bitter; copper-coloured, medium bodied with complex malt flavor.

That insight, along with an enduring passion for the craft of beer making, led us to create the Barebottle, a San Francisco crowd-inspired craft brewery.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy and process is pretty simple:\r\n1) Use the things that inspire us every day from the SF\/Bay Area as the foundation for each new beer we make.\r\n\r\n2) Inspire our merry band of super-talented homebrewing experts (which includes our head brewer, the founders, and some of the bay area\u2019s best homebrewers) to create new beers.\r\n\r\n3) Just like in regular competitions, we pilot-brew a select group of the best finalist beers and ask visitors to the brewery to cast their vote for their favorite beer. May the best beer always win.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this approach will lead to some incredible beers, and we hope you are eager to help us try some of them.- Ben, Lester, and Mike","website":"http:\/\/www.barebottlebeer.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"lesterkoga@gmail.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:42","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"O9ERXQA0BL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"44rVs2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1525 Cortland Ave","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94110","website":"http:\/\/www.barebottle.com","latitude":37.7401129,"longitude":-122.409035,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2017-09-20 12:55:53","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bIcI0x","name":"Best Wiener","nameDisplay":"Best Wiener","description":"With its subtle toasted German malt aroma, this clean lager has an elegant malt complexity with just enough hop bitterness to balance its finish.
