Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us.

In brewing, Saaz usually refers to the hop cultivar traditionally associated with Saaz and Bohemian Pilsner. Although the traditional name for this hop would be Saazer (or Saaz Saazer when grown in the Saaz area), it is generally simply referred to as Saaz or Czech Saaz. zech Saaz is grown not only in ?atec area but also in Tr?ice area (Central Moravia) and ?st? n\/L area (North Bohemia). Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American). True Saaz Saazer hops are prized for their mild, pleasant flavor, and are the only choice for brewing an authentic Pilsner.","countryOfOrigin":"CZ","alphaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMax":8,"humuleneMin":15,"humuleneMax":45,"caryophylleneMin":10,"caryophylleneMax":12,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":28,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":40,"farneseneMin":11,"farneseneMax":20,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:29","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"CZ","name":"CZECH REPUBLIC","displayName":"Czech Republic","isoThree":"CZE","numberCode":203,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":134,"name":"Styrian Goldings","description":"Styria is a traditional hop-growing region on the modern-day Austrian\/Slovenian border, and hop farms can be found on both sides of the border, although in modern times this variety is more closely associated with Slovenia and is sometimes called Savinja Goldings after a river in Slovenia. Although referred to as Styrian Golding, this hop is actually genetically derived from Fuggle rather than Golding hops. At one time the less desirable Fuggles were exported to some areas as \"Fuggle Golding,\" which is probably the source of the name. This hop became the primary hop grown in Styria in the 1930s when their other landrace varieties were severely damaged by powdery mildew. Because it is genetically derived from Fuggle, it is not surprising that Styrian Goldings also resembles Fuggle in character, with a pleasant spicy aroma.","countryOfOrigin":"AT","alphaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMin":1.8,"betaAcidMax":4.1,"humuleneMin":25,"humuleneMax":38,"caryophylleneMin":7,"caryophylleneMax":12,"cohumuloneMin":25,"cohumuloneMax":33,"myrceneMin":25,"myrceneMax":38,"farneseneMin":2,"farneseneMax":8,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:37","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"yeast":[{"id":1756,"name":"Abbey Ale","description":"Used to produce Trappist style beers.

Located at the corner of Broadway and Ottawa Streets it is the oldest working commercial building in Toledo. Our Brew Masters bring excellence in brewing and culinary experience to our craft beers. We transfer the same strength, creativeness, size, uniqueness and complexity of the architecture of the Oliver House to the artistry of our craft beer. No other brewery in the country brews under such history. With additional holding tanks and a bottling line located directly across the street at 28 Broadway, MBBCo's process requires great attention to detail and is very labor intensive. This delicate care sets our final product apart from other mass-produced brewing competitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year we have 7 beers on tap at the Maumee Bay Brew Pub, including the historical Buckeye Beer. Additionally, our beers are available at all of the restaurants in the historic Oliver House. Come enjoy our craft beer paired with Toledo's best steak at Rockwell's or enjoy a pint with a pizza baked in our wood oven at the Pub. Enjoy a brewer's sample and some classic gaming at Mutz. It's simply a great place to be - in a whole lot of old and new ways! Our beer is also available for sale in half-gallon growlers \"to go.\" We have twelve packs and kegs of Buckeye Beer available, plus kegs of select craft beers like Oktoberfest and Blitzen Ale seasonally.","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:33:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GCUYBF2Q4A","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cSJ6eN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 Broadway","locality":"Toledo","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43602","phone":"419-243-1302","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday \u2013 Thursday 3p.m. - 10p.m.\r\nFriday and Saturdays 3p.m.- 11p.m.","latitude":41.6432338,"longitude":-83.5384216,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday \u2013 Thursday 3p.m. - 10p.m.\r\nFriday and Saturdays 3p.m.- 11p.m.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2VllOX","name":"Belgian Trippel","nameDisplay":"Belgian Trippel","styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:47","updateDate":"2015-05-21 23:44:50","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts.

An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:49:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"J4QKGRMBLD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"4V6C7Y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2406 Clinton Avenue","locality":"West Huntsville","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35805","phone":"256-975-5950","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.722525,"longitude":-86.603703,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kAZ3jE","name":"Belgian White","nameDisplay":"Belgian White","description":"Tap Room No. 21 Belgian White is brewed with complex flavors of orange peel, coriander and subtle spice.
