We love beer, we love working with each other, we continually push the limits of beer and ourselves, and we grow as a profitable and sustainable company (and as individuals), without compromising our values or purpose. This passion has helped us push Allagash to the forefront of the growing Belgian beer category. We\u2019ve won countless awards for our beer (11 medals including 4 gold since 2002 at The Great American Beer Festival & 10 medals including gold & silver in 2012 since 1998 at the bi-annual World Beer Cup), and received acclaim in the press (Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Men\u2019s Journal, GQ, The Wall Street Journal and Saveur).

And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.","website":"http:\/\/www.pennbrew.com\/","established":"1986","mailingListUrl":"sandy@pennbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZH1495YOAU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"G1Jsyq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"800 Vinial St.","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15212","phone":"412-237-9400","website":"http:\/\/www.pennbrew.com\/","latitude":40.4567765,"longitude":-79.9913373,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1848","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"nPCkJt","name":"Penn Brewing - Pittsburgh Airport","streetAddress":"1000 Airport Boulevard","extendedAddress":"Concourse A","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15231","phone":"412-472-5419","website":"https:\/\/www.pennbrew.com\/pittsburgh-international-airport","latitude":40.4957722,"longitude":-80.2413113,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-09-16 21:56:23","updateDate":"2019-09-18 12:37:07","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":26,"name":"Chinook","description":"Released in 1985, Chinook is a strong bittering hop derived from Petham Golding, one of the English Golding hops.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"0dM1NH","name":"Almanac Beer Co","nameShortDisplay":"Almanac Beer Co","description":"Our artisanal ales are brewed in collaboration with select Northern California sustainable farms.

The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"sk5YLK","name":"Buffalo Bayou Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Buffalo Bayou","description":"Buffalo Bayou Brewing Company is a new twist on an old craft.
