When Western Europe embraced the lager yeast in the middle of the 19th century, Dusseldorf decided to keep brewing their top-fermented beer. Altbier is thus an ale that is aged (lagered) like a lager.

Hop bitterness is medium to very high (although the 25 to 35 IBU range is more normal for the majority of Altbiers from D\u00fcsseldorf). Fruity-ester flavors can be low. No diacetyl should be perceived. The overall impression is clean, crisp, and flavorful often with a dry finish. Body is medium.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"52","abvMin":"4.3","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:08:31"},"breweries":[{"id":"vkOn59","name":"Mad Fox Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Mad Fox","description":"Mad Fox Brewing Company offers a dining experience unique to the Washington, DC, area: upscale casual dining in an English-style gastro brewpub with an emphasis on high-quality food to complement our house-brewed beers.\r\n\r\nMad Fox features a chef-driven, seasonal menu and frequent specials including pizza, panini, salads and vegetarian friendly foods; fresh, locally grown seasonal produce, cheeses and other ingredients; locally raised lamb, bison, beef, chicken and game; and house-cured meats.\r\n\r\nMad Fox has a 63-foot long bar showcasing our seven to ten standard, house-brewed beers on tap as well as a rotating selection of seasonal brews in German, English, Belgian and American styles.
