These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"WRgdAj","name":"Hailstorm Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Hailstorm","description":"Hailstorm Brewing Co. is a brewery located in Tinley Park, IL.

Thanks to this crazy new bar in Winnetka, CA and our buddy the bartender, we were introduced to new styles of beer that were much different than the commercial brands we were used to. After many conversations on the process of making beer and the brewing techniques of smaller breweries, we decided to take a chance at brewing our own malted, adult beverages! \r\n\r\nWe signed up for a Maltose Falcons class, bought a brewing kit and a turkey fryer and made a batch of beer on June 23, 2012. After this first batch, we were hooked! We invested more time in learning about the process, fabricated custom brewing equipment and experimented with new recipes while tweaking them to make them our own. \r\n\r\nAfter serving samples of our homemade brews and getting positive feedback, we began talking of doing it legit and opening up a brewery!  Given our Valley roots and the fact our beer was brewed out of a garage in Sylmar, CA, we decided 818 Brewing was the perfect name and we filed our paperwork in October 2014 for our new venture.\r\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ve enjoyed the most along our journey is the sense of community within the craft brew scene. Not many products can bring together men and women of different nationalities, age groups, religious beliefs, income levels, political views \u2013 and even fellow brewers! \u2013 And create a moment of common ground.  8 one 8 Brewing is proud to offer a product that brings us together to say cheers!","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home\/?age-verified=cd0a2fef44","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:30:46","updateDate":"2019-07-02 19:08:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AH21G7RNY4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"GTwDJI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8951 De Soto Ave.","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:31:54","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"73xdsm","name":"8one8 brewery","streetAddress":"8951 de soto ave","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-08-09 23:43:32","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:44","forwardingId":"GTwDJI","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"myCAim","name":"1st Street Ale","nameDisplay":"1st Street Ale","description":"This Blonde Ale is dedicated to the city of Katy, Texas.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dyydfi","name":"2 Bit","nameDisplay":"2 Bit","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dyydfi\/upload_otCF76-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dyydfi\/upload_otCF76-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dyydfi\/upload_otCF76-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dyydfi\/upload_otCF76-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dyydfi\/upload_otCF76-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dyydfi\/upload_otCF76-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-29 10:06:12","updateDate":"2015-12-17 12:41:08","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.
