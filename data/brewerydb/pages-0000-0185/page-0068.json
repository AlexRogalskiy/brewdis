Our flagship beers include The Centennial IPA, Citrus SMaSH IPA, Bluff Charge Oatmeal Pale, Swimmer\u2019s Itch Saison, and Moonlight Paddle Kettle Sour. We also have a rotating selection of seasonal brews. Visit our Pubhouse in Bigfork for a fresh, locally farmed, seasonal menu featuring daily specials and a wide range of food entrees such as in-house smoked meats, seafood, our famous clam chowder, and homemade desserts.\r\n\r\nThe Flathead Lake Brewing Company started in 2004 in Woods Bay, Montana. Our owner Greg Johnston has two very specific goals. The first: to make the best beer ever. The second: to have fun doing it. Naming the brewery wasn\u2019t hard. FLBC overlooks the shores of the largest freshwater lake in the West \u2013 and we would argue the most beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 we were honored with becoming the youngest brewery ever to win not just one, but two, World Beer Cup awards. Our brewery brought home a Bronze medal for our Peg Leg Porter and a Silver medal for our Mutiny Stout.\r\n\r\nWe at FLBC work hard, play harder, and do everything to the highest standard. For us, it\u2019s about being leaders in the beer industry, it\u2019s about supporting local and environmental sustainability, and it\u2019s about contributing to the community that has so graciously embraced us. Most importantly for our crew, it\u2019s about making beer and food that we are proud of. We love what we do, and we hope you do too.\r\n\r\nMontana is the Treasure State, and we are Montana\u2019s Liquid Treasure.","website":"http:\/\/www.flatheadlakebrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:05:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8NJ793DXHU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CHRyRk","name":"Woods Bay","streetAddress":"26008 East Lake Shore Rte.","locality":"Bigfork","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59911","phone":"406-837-0353","website":"http:\/\/www.flatheadlakebrewing.com\/","latitude":47.998205,"longitude":-114.045602,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-06-04 18:45:20","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XF4JJ4","name":"Missoula","streetAddress":"424 North Higgins","locality":"Missoula","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59802","phone":"406-542-3847","website":"http:\/\/www.flbcofmissoula.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Friday    3:00 to 12:00 \r\nSaturday 11:00 to 12:00 \r\nSunday 11:00 to 10:00","latitude":46.873384,"longitude":-113.99322,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-15 21:34:43","updateDate":"2015-06-05 16:11:31","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Friday    3:00 to 12:00 \r\nSaturday 11:00 to 12:00 \r\nSunday 11:00 to 10:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"3JNh3v","name":"FLBC Pubhouse","streetAddress":"116 Holt Dr.","locality":"Bigfork","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59911","phone":"4068370085","latitude":48.0642939,"longitude":-114.083249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-04 18:35:45","updateDate":"2015-06-05 16:11:31","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fkTgzD","name":"Amber Ale","nameDisplay":"Amber Ale","description":"Our smooth Amber Ale is most definitely in a class by herself, as we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll agree when both your eye and palate are captured by the beauty of this addition to the Brew Werks family of beers.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.
