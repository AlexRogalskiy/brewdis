The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IGMGkz","name":"Apple Brandy Barrel Aged Imperial Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Apple Brandy Barrel Aged Imperial Milk Stout","description":"Imperial Milk Stout aged on Apple Brandy barrels.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.

Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

The experience is unlike any other you can find in beer.","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:41:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"622Y3A","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"223 North Main","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74107","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","latitude":36.159253,"longitude":-95.9937507,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:42:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:09","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IwMl7T","name":"Prairie Artisan Ales Taproom","streetAddress":"3 NE 8th St.","locality":"Oklahoma City","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"73104","phone":"(405) 602-0894","website":"https:\/\/prairieales.com\/okc-taproom\/","latitude":35.4763325,"longitude":-97.5117798,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:50:43","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-11:00am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"M6Lgxd","name":"Apple Brandy Barrel Oil of Aphrodite","nameDisplay":"Apple Brandy Barrel Oil of Aphrodite","description":"A 12.2 percent ABV imperial stout brewed with locally-harvested black walnuts and Belgian candied syrup before being aged in Laird\u2019s Apple Brandy barrels for one year.","abv":"12.2","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/M6Lgxd\/upload_2nRncR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/M6Lgxd\/upload_2nRncR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/M6Lgxd\/upload_2nRncR-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/M6Lgxd\/upload_2nRncR-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/M6Lgxd\/upload_2nRncR-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/M6Lgxd\/upload_2nRncR-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-01-30 16:47:13","updateDate":"2019-01-30 16:47:31","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ohy298","name":"Flat12 Bierwerks","nameShortDisplay":"Flat12 Bierwerks","description":"Flat12 Bierwerks is a production craft brewery based in downtown Indianapolis, USA.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:11:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:08:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0YH75KD3FB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Zhydrx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2545 Progress Street","extendedAddress":"Suite D","locality":"Vista","region":"California","postalCode":"92081","phone":"(760) 295-0217","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","latitude":33.148172,"longitude":-117.218047,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:13:42","updateDate":"2015-08-26 16:23:19","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ScGFRY","name":"Apple Cherry","nameDisplay":"Apple Cherry","abv":"6.9","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-14 16:33:34","updateDate":"2016-03-14 16:33:34","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D\u2019Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.\r\nAs we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island\u2019s climate and rocky limestone soil. Our Washington Island orchard has expanded with our passion for cider, and we now produce several varieties of gluten-free cider in our Cider House in the small town of Ellison Bay, WI, located at the tip of the Door Peninsula.","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:56:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AK23DS9YUB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-11:00pm,sat-2:00pm-11:00pm,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"F5TjRY","name":"Apple Cider","nameDisplay":"Apple Cider","description":"Single variety cox orange, back-sweetened with fresh apple juice.","abv":"5","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-10 19:40:15","updateDate":"2018-07-10 19:40:15","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"},"breweries":[{"id":"QmlnJm","name":"South Cider","nameShortDisplay":"South Cider","description":"Eddie Giles began his career in fermentation making wine.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com. Becky worked with Chatham Hill Winery for 2 years learning tasting room and wine club management.

He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

During this time Josh\u2019s father Randy was responsible for pressing Burnham Orchards apple cider which is where making hard cider all began for Josh. Randy would bring home fresh apple cider and over the years would make hard cider from this for family and friends. Josh became intrigued with the process and started to learn some Raboin family tradition of making hard cider. As the years passed every fall and winter Josh would obtain fresh apple cider from the farm, start the process of fermenting it, and turning it hard for family and friends. Josh began experimenting more and more throughout the years with different recipes and ingredients developing unique hard ciders.\r\n\r\nTalks between Josh and Joe about bringing these hard ciders to the public began in 2012. Fast forward to today and Redhead Ciderhouse is now producing and distributing these hard ciders throughout Northern Ohio. We strive to bring the freshest, purest, and most unique hard ciders to the public.

At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5.
