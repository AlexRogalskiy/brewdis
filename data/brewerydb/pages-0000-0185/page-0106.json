It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery.

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H05RKIPET3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

The plums add a subtle yet bright and fruity character to the beer. Next, we dosed the beer with generous helpings of Cascade and Amarillo hops.

With the help of Peter Maxwell Stuart, a Scottish nobleman and brewer who arranged introductions and itineraries, he worked in a half-dozen small commercial breweries from the highlands of Scotland to the south coast of England.","website":"http:\/\/www.gearybrewing.com","established":"1983","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QYiAND\/upload_CeDeJt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QYiAND\/upload_CeDeJt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QYiAND\/upload_CeDeJt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QYiAND\/upload_CeDeJt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QYiAND\/upload_CeDeJt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:18:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OL4XKJZSHI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Of6bJU","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"38 Evergreen Drive","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04103","phone":"207-878-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.gearybrewing.com","latitude":43.7076099,"longitude":-70.3148663,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:19:45","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1unO6C","name":"Autumn Ale","nameDisplay":"Autumn Ale","description":"Looking for a fresh take on Oktoberfest beer?\r\n\r\nBreckenridge Brewery's fall seasonal combines the malty goodness of a German lager with the clean crispness of an American ale.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"igzD4a","name":"Autumn Ale","nameDisplay":"Autumn Ale","description":"Autumn Ale is a true-to-style London Extra Special Bitter (ESB).

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"x9wfYI","name":"Autumn Ale","nameDisplay":"Autumn Ale","styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:43","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:49","style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content. Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"CXuX9r","name":"Gray's Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Gray's","website":"http:\/\/www.graybrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CXuX9r\/upload_refaPs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CXuX9r\/upload_refaPs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CXuX9r\/upload_refaPs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CXuX9r\/upload_refaPs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CXuX9r\/upload_refaPs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:06:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2BWZMH6O1R","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"L8M1u9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2424 West Court Street","locality":"Janesville","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53545","phone":"608-752-3552","website":"http:\/\/www.graybrewing.com\/","latitude":42.6792623,"longitude":-89.0500185,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"5xVVQL","name":"Gray's Tied House","streetAddress":"950 Kimball Lane","locality":"Verona","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53593","phone":"(608) 845-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.graystiedhouse.com\/","latitude":42.9779034,"longitude":-89.5158299,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-28 12:55:30","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"I67e9U","name":"Autumn Ale Brew","nameDisplay":"Autumn Ale Brew","description":"Chestnut in overall color.

If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"4MVtcc","name":"The Bruery","nameShortDisplay":"The Bruery","description":"A boutique craft brewery located in Orange County, California specializing in experimental and barrel aged beer. Our name is a fusion of 'brewery' with our family name, Rue.\r\n\r\nOur calling is to create beers with character and depth using the simplest and purest of means. We do not filter or pasteurize our beers. Most of our bottled beers gain carbonation through bottle conditioning, allowing carbonation to naturally occur through a secondary bottle fermentation. We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PD1LOINQV7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
