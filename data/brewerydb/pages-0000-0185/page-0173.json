Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"bdjbTZ","name":"Breakside Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Breakside","description":"Breakside Brewery opened in 2010 in Northeast Portland as a restaurant and pub brewery.

During that time, Rob cultivated his passion and skill for homebrewing and received an Associates Degree in Brewing Science from the Siebel Institute.  Then, with full support from Ali, he started an invaluable internship at Port Jeff Brewing Company in Long Island. \r\n\r\nIt was a long commute from Brooklyn, and even longer work hours, but Rob's love for brewing only grew. His passion rubbed off on Ali, who had over the years become a self-professed beer snob, and she began reading up on the business side of brewing. Eventually it became clear that the two would open their own brewery.  They started scouting out the perfect locale for their business and stopped when they found the blossoming town of Derry, NH, in Ali\u2019s home state.","website":"http:\/\/www.rockinghambrewing.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@rockinghambrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-27 21:04:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:59:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"L2VXN7D9BE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HW6qMZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"One Corporate Park Drive #1","locality":"Derry","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03038","phone":"(603) 216-2324","website":"http:\/\/www.rockinghambrewing.com\/","latitude":42.8858758,"longitude":-71.3358808,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-27 21:09:27","updateDate":"2015-04-20 12:37:14","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-3:00pm-7:00pm,fri-3:00pm-7:00pm,sat-1:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LEJ96U","name":"Belly River Oat Meal Stout","nameDisplay":"Belly River Oat Meal Stout","description":"A full bodied, dark stout with creamy texture balanced by a slightly roasty taste.

The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"JBt20m","name":"SandLot Brewery at Coors Field","nameShortDisplay":"SandLot Brewery at Coors Field","description":"In 1995 the Sandlot Brewery was the first brewery to be located inside a Major League Baseball Stadium.\r\n\r\nSoon after opening, the Sandlot Brewmasters created a Belgian style wit that they called Belly Slide Wit.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Soon after, the brewery developed a reputation for a well-balanced, full-bodied beer that only quality ingredients in perfect amounts could produce.  The barley is grown and malted just a few miles from the brewery while the malted wheat and hops come from the Northwest. \r\n\r\nThe brewery uses modern, state-of-the-art brewing equipment but is still a \"hands-on\" system, which allows brewery owners Stan and John to ensure high production quality.  They oversee every step of the process, from malt handling to mashing, from wort transfer to yeast pitching, from fermentation to conditioning, and from packaging to shipping.  The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans. Harvest Moon Brewing Company calls Belt home and has named their wheat, Belgian-style ale, Beltian White, after the town.\r\n\r\nBelt is also strategically located above one of the purest sources of water. Wells tap into the Madison Formation where constant year-round temperature and quality allow Harvest Moon to use some of the most perfect water on Earth to brew beer.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing about Belt? They are located in the center of our great state, right in the middle of the grain-growers that supply our brewery with prime barley & wheat. Harvest Moon\u2019s ties to the farming community don\u2019t end there\u2026after we use the grains, we supply the spent mash to a local pig farmer to feed his hogs. Hence the name, Pigs Ass Porter.

It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put up\" a dozen people from \"the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.\r\n\r\nGrandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.","website":"http:\/\/www.cooperstownbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2019-03-15 19:06:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PTODAYWX16","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hG1G1v","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"110 River Street","extendedAddress":"P.O.
