Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"7VPQrN","name":"Sixpoint Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Sixpoint","description":"Sixpoint Craft Ales was founded in 2004 by Shane Welch, a former homebrewer that originally grew up in Milwaukee.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

As the city of Nashville grew, so did the brewery, and it quickly became apparent that expansion was necessary. The company purchased an acre and a half of land at 800 44th Avenue North, and went to work on the future of the brewery. Shortly after celebrating 4 years of business, the move from the East side to the West side began. From roughly 5000 square feet, to a brand new, state of the art, 33,000 square foot facility. When asked what the vision was for the project, Ben answered with one word, \u201cQuality\u201d.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"aX1vnT","name":"Fat Bottom Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Fat Bottom","description":"Fat Bottom Brewing Company opened its doors in August of 2012, and as East Nashville\u2019s first brewery, it quickly became a neighborhood favorite. The recipes were developed from Ben Bredesen's time as a homebrewer, and scaled up to fit the newly installed 15 barrel brewhouse. As the city of Nashville grew, so did the brewery, and it quickly became apparent that expansion was necessary. The company purchased an acre and a half of land at 800 44th Avenue North, and went to work on the future of the brewery. Shortly after celebrating 4 years of business, the move from the East side to the West side began. From roughly 5000 square feet, to a brand new, state of the art, 33,000 square foot facility. When asked what the vision was for the project, Ben answered with one word, \u201cQuality\u201d. This wasn\u2019t about time or money, it\u2019s a commitment to making the beer the best it can be.","website":"http:\/\/www.fatbottombrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aX1vnT\/upload_fyUfck-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aX1vnT\/upload_fyUfck-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aX1vnT\/upload_fyUfck-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aX1vnT\/upload_fyUfck-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aX1vnT\/upload_fyUfck-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:19:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HUT73Z1CXP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"leClRi","name":"Brewery and Hop Yard","streetAddress":"800 44th Ave N","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37209","phone":"615.678.5895","website":"http:\/\/www.fatbottombrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thurs: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSat: 12pm - 12am\r\nSun: 12pm - 10pm","latitude":36.157153,"longitude":-86.8394228,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-06-19 16:42:30","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thurs: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSat: 12pm - 12am\r\nSun: 12pm - 10pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AHMw3k","name":"Berth\u00f4","nameDisplay":"Berth\u00f4","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AHMw3k\/upload_3HhIPc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AHMw3k\/upload_3HhIPc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AHMw3k\/upload_3HhIPc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AHMw3k\/upload_3HhIPc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AHMw3k\/upload_3HhIPc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AHMw3k\/upload_3HhIPc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-09 21:19:47","updateDate":"2015-12-17 12:59:58","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
