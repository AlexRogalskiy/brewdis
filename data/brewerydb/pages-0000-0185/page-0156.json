Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

To those people we say: raise a pint, because you believe how we believe.","website":"http:\/\/www.aleasylum.com","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MMSB2i\/upload_XURlcY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MMSB2i\/upload_XURlcY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MMSB2i\/upload_XURlcY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MMSB2i\/upload_XURlcY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MMSB2i\/upload_XURlcY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:12:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9DF36OSNG2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"boTIWO","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"2002 Pankratz St","locality":"Madison","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53704-4024","phone":"608-663-3926","website":"http:\/\/www.aleasylum.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:11:00 am - 2:00 am\r\nSun:2:00 pm - 12:00 am","latitude":43.1207344,"longitude":-89.3537098,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-04-21 14:09:14","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"2:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"2:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-2:00am,sat-11:00am-2:00am,sun-2:00pm-12:00am","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:11:00 am - 2:00 am\r\nSun:2:00 pm - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1NOTvG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2002 Pankratz St.","locality":"Madison","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53704","phone":"(608) 663-3926","website":"http:\/\/aleasylum.com\/","latitude":43.1207344,"longitude":-89.3537098,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-04-01 00:03:46","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:17:38","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"k3scYW","name":"Bedotter\u2122","nameDisplay":"Bedotter\u2122","description":"Traditional Belgian-style golden ale with complex aroma and notes of plum, spice and banana with refreshing balanced bitterness.\r\nAwards: 2002, 2003, 2004 GABF Bronze Medal; 2014 GABF Silver Medal in the Belgian-Style Tripel category.","abv":"9.5","ibu":"38","glasswareId":1,"srmId":4,"availableId":2,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k3scYW\/upload_cjkKKk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k3scYW\/upload_cjkKKk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k3scYW\/upload_cjkKKk-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k3scYW\/upload_cjkKKk-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k3scYW\/upload_cjkKKk-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k3scYW\/upload_cjkKKk-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.088","createDate":"2014-09-16 17:34:33","updateDate":"2018-09-12 17:28:15","glass":{"id":1,"name":"Flute","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"02Ne4w","name":"Iron Hill Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Iron Hill","description":"Welcome to Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, where you'll find fine handcrafted beers, creative yet informal cuisine, and friendly, attentive service in a casual, upscale atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe're passionate about producing distinctive, full-flavored handcrafted beers, accompanied by fresh\u2013from\u2013scratch New American cuisine in a comfortable, casual atmosphere.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant.
