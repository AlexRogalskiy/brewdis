There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"I8WZv2","name":"Great Divide Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Great Divide","description":"These beers have landed an impressive amount of acclaim: Great Divide beers have earned 18 Great American Beer Festival medals and 5 World Beer Cup awards.

Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.","website":"http:\/\/www.manayunkbrewery.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:32:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TVWYJ9IFC0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qHBDmR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4120 Main Street","locality":"Philadelphia","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19127","phone":"215-482-8220","website":"http:\/\/www.manayunkbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.0235771,"longitude":-75.2202026,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FPNwB5","name":"21st Anniversary Ale","nameDisplay":"21st Anniversary Ale","description":"Now that we are 21, our palate has matured like a fine wine.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"mtUjck","name":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Karl Strauss","description":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company has pioneered the San Diego beer scene since 1989 with innovative beer releases like Mosaic Session Ale, Big Barrel IIPA, and Wreck Alley Imperial Stout.

With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Whether developing new styles, adapting established ones, or bringing the less well-known styles back into the limelight, we create each beer with the same level of care, attention and respect.\r\nAll of these carefully crafted beers are brewed with the finest natural ingredients and packaged alive, in both bottle and KeyKeg, to ensure a natural carbonation and allow flavours to evolve over time. The harshest critics of our own work, we only release beers that are of a high standard, balanced and drinkable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE INSPIRATION\r\n\r\nBefore brewing together, Dave and Tom took their inspiration from opposite sides of the world.  Dave discovered craft beer in Australia and New Zealand, while Tom, introduced to The Kernel Brewery during the early days, was blown away by the intensity and variety of flavours that come from the new world hops they were using.\r\n\r\nSince brewing together, Tom and Dave took a trip to Belgium for the Festival of Spontaneous Fermentation \u2013 a weekend dedicated to Gueuze and Lambic beers \u2013 and were taken aback by the refreshing crispness of Belgian Saisons and the funky acidity created by the wild yeast Brettanomyces, intrigued by the herbal and spicy tartness of Witbiers, and blown away by the rich complexity of the Abbey style ales.\r\n\r\nBrew By Numbers continues to draw inspiration from other breweries in the States and the UK as well as taking inspiration from flavour combinations from everyday life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING\r\n\r\nTom and Dave met in China on a rock climbing tour around Asia.  After hanging out on the rocks and riding motorbikes around Vietnamese islands and the hilly borderlands between Laos and Myanmar they formed a solid friendship.\r\n\r\nIn April 2011, Dave returned from travelling after two years in the Antipodes, drinking craft beer and doing some basic homebrew.  At the same time, Tom \u2013 an old friend of Toby from the Kernel \u2013 was drinking their IPAs and Pale Ales, wondering how he could do them differently.\r\n\r\nBy August that year Dave and Tom, committed to opening their own microbrewery, had secured the use of a friend\u2019s basement on Southwark Bridge Road and built a simple homebrew kit.  Through reading books on brewing, researching online, and asking for tips and advice from friends in the industry, Dave and Tom began to teach themselves to brew.\r\n\r\nThe first three brews were made with malt extract, boiled with hops to give flavour and bitterness, and fermented in plastic buckets.  From brew 4 onwards Dave and Tom moved to all-grain mashes, using malted grains instead of extract to achieve more authentic results.\r\n\r\nTheir set-up was rudimentary: a 50ltr coolbox with homemade copper manifold and sparge arm and a plastic container for both hot liquor (water) tank (HLT) and boil kettle.  But results were good, and by brews 6 and 7 people were seeing potential.\r\n\r\nDave and Tom progressed quickly.  This was, in part, because they would split batches at different stages to create variations of each brew \u2013 whether at the boil to allow different hop and spice additions, in the fermentor to allow the use of different yeasts, or post-fermentation to allow the use of dry hopping, infusions or wild yeasts.  By doing this, original recipes and methods were developed.\r\n\r\nIn February 2012 a French Saison yeast strain was brought to London for a collaboration brew between two prominent UK brewers.  That strain gradually made its way around London\u2019s breweries, finally reaching Dave and Tom, and by brew 20 they made their first Citra Saison.  Now officially Brew By Numbers, Dave and Tom took this \u2018Hoppy Saison\u2019 to the staff at Craft Beer Co. Clerkenwell for their critique.\r\n\r\nJune 2012 and Dave and Tom visited Belgium with Andy from Partizan Brewing (then still brewing at Redemption) and Toby from the Kernel.  Upon returning, inspired by the trip, BBNo. brewed their first Brett-aged Saison and began planning to brew Witbiers and Belgian Blonde Ales.\r\n\r\nIn July 2012 a generous philanthropist donated enough money for Dave and Tom to move to stainless equipment \u2013 for HLT\/kettle and mash tun, at least.  This investment allowed many upgrades that would help BBNo. achieve their goal of selling beer brewed in their basement space.\r\n\r\nThey achieved that goal when in November 2012 they received permission from Southwark Council to brew beer for sale and on December 1st hosted the official launch party of Brew By Numbers at The Craft Beer Co. in Clerkenwell.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE BREWHOUSE\r\n\r\nWith the recent flourish of microbreweries in the UK the demand for and cost of used brewhouses is high.  BBNo. was faced with two options: spend a lot on a small, second-hand brewhouse, or create our own.  The choice was easy, so inspired by the craft breweries of Australia and New Zealand \u2013 where brewery-specific equipment is scarce \u2013 we decided to convert used stainless soft drink and dairy vessels to create our own bespoke brewhouse.\r\n\r\nBBNo.\u2019s brewhouse has one of the smallest footprints of any 12 barrel (bbl) brewery in the UK, with a gravity fed whirlpool allowing the brewers to use hop pellets in the boil for maximum flavour extraction.  The cladding and banding were all done by hand, in-house, with the help of some volunteers.\r\n\r\nNow the brewhouse is finished, the old tanks are ready to enjoy their latest incarnation, making some of the finest beer south of the river.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE PILOT KIT\r\n\r\nExperimentation has always been a mainstay of our approach to brewing.  With the 12bbl brewhouse up and running our original brew kit has become our pilot kit.  On this kit we develop new ideas and recipes, testing new ingredients and creating short-run, limited-release batches.\r\n\r\nThe pilot kit is one tenth the size of our new brewhouse, making the upscaling of recipes quite simple.  Furthermore, wort from the large brewhouse can be collected and used to create different recipe variations.  From brewing Imperial versions of the main batch to creating a series of Coffee Porters, this flexibility allows us to push the boundaries of our understanding and continually extend our knowledge.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out for the red Pi stamp indicating these exclusive new brews.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE LOCATION\r\n\r\nBBNo. HQ stands shoulder to shoulder with other artisan producers in the heart of Bermondsey\u2019s culinary quarter, a stone\u2019s throw from the popular Maltby Street Market and Spa Terminus.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOPEN DAYS AND EVENTS\r\n\r\nBrew By Numbers is open every Saturday from 10:00-17:00 and we welcome visitors to try our latest creations.

The brewery was established by Hugh Sisson in 1995. Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_AycPM1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_AycPM1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_AycPM1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_AycPM1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_AycPM1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2019-07-09 18:17:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OU40DR7XZG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"yX6twV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4615-B Hollins Ferry Road","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21227","phone":"410-247-7822","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","latitude":39.230827,"longitude":-76.6751309,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vh3ZUn","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Baltimore","streetAddress":"1300 Bank Street","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21231","phone":"(410) 753-1403","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","latitude":39.2866436,"longitude":-76.598757,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-05-23 22:13:06","updateDate":"2019-07-09 18:18:06","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gmfbj6","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Arlington","streetAddress":"1501 Wilson Blvd","locality":"Arlington","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22209","phone":"(703) 879-4388","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","latitude":38.8952016,"longitude":-77.0742466,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:30","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"2:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"2:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-2:00am,sat-11:00am-2:00am,sun-11:00am-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"E976o1","name":"2200lbs of Sin","nameDisplay":"2200lbs of Sin","abv":"9.2","ibu":"96","srmId":18,"styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E976o1\/upload_ZRJnlK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E976o1\/upload_ZRJnlK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E976o1\/upload_ZRJnlK-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E976o1\/upload_ZRJnlK-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E976o1\/upload_ZRJnlK-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E976o1\/upload_ZRJnlK-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-31 13:49:38","updateDate":"2015-12-17 10:14:03","srm":{"id":18,"name":"18","hex":"A63E00"},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"mtUjck","name":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Karl Strauss","description":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company has pioneered the San Diego beer scene since 1989 with innovative beer releases like Mosaic Session Ale, Big Barrel IIPA, and Wreck Alley Imperial Stout.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"uoQoRs","name":"Uinta Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Uinta","description":"Named after the only major east-west running mountain range located in the continental U.S., Uinta Brewing Company's journey began in 1993 with the reality that passion for craft beer and a hankering for the great outdoors could align in Salt Lake City, UT.\r\n \r\nBuilt on an axis point that endorses sustainability, community involvement and innovation, their compass guides them on a path to admirable, consistent craft beer leading consumers to discover a brand with passion, personality and soul.
