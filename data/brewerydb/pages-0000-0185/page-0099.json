This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"TJyuyR","name":"Urban Artifact","nameShortDisplay":"Urban Artifact","description":"All our beers are wild.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"uGY7WE","name":"Artifex Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Artifex","description":"Micro Brewery and Tasting room located in San Clemente, CA","website":"http:\/\/www.artifexbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"artifex@artifexbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 18:10:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:09:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"NVSXGQBJTM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1UJAd1","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"919 Calle Amanecer","extendedAddress":"Suite A","locality":"San Clemente","region":"California","phone":"949-429-7805","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nMon:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nTue:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nWed:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm","latitude":33.4493503,"longitude":-117.605586,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 18:02:11","updateDate":"2016-04-29 18:04:35","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nMon:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nTue:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nWed:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"iiMiGs","name":"Artificial Intelligence","nameDisplay":"Artificial Intelligence","abv":"7.6","ibu":"69","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iiMiGs\/upload_BRlzIb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iiMiGs\/upload_BRlzIb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iiMiGs\/upload_BRlzIb-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iiMiGs\/upload_BRlzIb-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iiMiGs\/upload_BRlzIb-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iiMiGs\/upload_BRlzIb-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Charcuterie Platter, Country Fried Chicken Sandwich, Stuffed Chicken Sandwich, Juevo Ranchero Burger, Salmon Sandwich.","createDate":"2015-07-23 18:34:57","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:28:11","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

A toasted-, biscuit-like, bready malt character along with low levels of sulfur compounds may be evident. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"7","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:36:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"Gm4Noa","name":"Cooperage Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Cooperage","description":"Cooperage Brewing Company will produce Cellar beers: small batch, artisan, barrel aged sour ales meant for aging as well as more traditional beer styles.\r\n\r\nCooperage Brewing Company will be a production craft brewery and retail Tap Room in Sonoma County, CA.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.9","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.066","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"G5qvbf","name":"Artisan's Brewery & Italian Grill","nameShortDisplay":"Artisan's Brewery & Italian Grill","description":"At Artisan's Brewery, \"Beer is Art\".\r\nOur Brewmaster Dave Hoffman hand selects hops and malted barley from only quality suppliers.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are handcrafted in the on premise Brewery, made from our Brewmaster\u2019s own recipes.\r\n\r\nWe proudly brew a variety of traditional beer styles and more distinctive specialty ales and lagers.","website":"http:\/\/artisanstomsriver.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/G5qvbf\/upload_tDGvNu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/G5qvbf\/upload_tDGvNu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/G5qvbf\/upload_tDGvNu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/G5qvbf\/upload_tDGvNu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/G5qvbf\/upload_tDGvNu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:10:33","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VYLA5MXEOH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Dcwb2m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1171 Hooper Avenue","locality":"Tom's River","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08753","phone":"732-244-7566","website":"http:\/\/artisanstomsriver.com\/","latitude":39.9767305,"longitude":-74.1828937,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"f82fk8","name":"Artisan\u2019s West Coast IPA","nameDisplay":"Artisan\u2019s West Coast IPA","description":"As the name implies, this is American style IPA - amber in color, medium-bodied, massive hop aroma & flavors aboundin the beer.

All shall undergo long maturation times while many others will spend time resting on wood.","website":"http:\/\/oecbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-06 16:28:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:55:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"YJIM4XBA78","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MJozk7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7 Fox Hollow Rd","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","phone":"(203) 295-2831","website":"http:\/\/oecbrewing.com","latitude":41.4684694,"longitude":-73.1200339,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-07 11:23:25","updateDate":"2014-08-07 11:23:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sat-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GC2IL3","name":"Artl\u00e4nder Artl\u00e4nder NOX","nameDisplay":"Artl\u00e4nder Artl\u00e4nder NOX","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:11:41","updateDate":"2018-11-06 17:55:04","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley. Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"uUd29P","name":"Artland Brauerei","nameShortDisplay":"Artland Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.artland-brauerei.de\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:18:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"11D3Xr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Elmar Wiemers Haller Str. 4","locality":"Nortrup","region":"Lower Saxony","postalCode":"49638","latitude":52.61706,"longitude":7.859219,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-13 01:24:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dsJUBc","name":"Artl\u00e4nder Pils","nameDisplay":"Artl\u00e4nder Pils","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:11:40","updateDate":"2017-09-06 15:38:53","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.
