Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"SmpY1A","name":"Papago Brewing (Huss Brewing Company)","nameShortDisplay":"Papago","description":"Papago Brewing Company is a division of Tempe, Arizona based Huss Brewing Company. \r\nArizona's Iconic Papago Orange Blossom Ale is what put Papago on the map and continues to flourish as part of the Huss brewing Family of beers!","website":"http:\/\/www.hussbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HussBrewing\/app\/100265896690345\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SmpY1A\/upload_TXk72Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SmpY1A\/upload_TXk72Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SmpY1A\/upload_TXk72Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SmpY1A\/upload_TXk72Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SmpY1A\/upload_TXk72Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HL8tmh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7107 East Mcdowell Road","locality":"Scottsdale","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"85257","phone":"(480) 425-7439","website":"http:\/\/www.papagobrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am","latitude":33.4655863,"longitude":-111.9279622,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OxqNfT","name":"Orange Blossom","nameDisplay":"Orange Blossom","abv":"12","styleId":141,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 13:30:35","updateDate":"2018-06-01 13:34:43","style":{"id":141,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Semi-Sweet Mead","shortName":"Semi-Sweet Mead","description":"Similar in balance, body, finish and flavor intensity to a semisweet (or medium-dry) white wine, with a pleasant mixture of honey character, light sweetness, soft fruity esters, and clean alcohol.

Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"21","abvMin":"5.6","abvMax":"8.6","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"IRqZSn","name":"Indian Wells Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Indian Wells","description":"Proudly producing fine ales & lagers since 1995.

While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, \u201cAmerican beers are boring and just are not very satisfying\u201d. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.

(English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
