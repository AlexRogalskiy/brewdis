Dahls Brewery was founded in 1856 by Erich Christian Dahl (1814\u20131882), a local businessman and consul-general from Trondheim. He was the son of Erich Dahl (1774-1821) Christine Lyche (1776-1861). His parents had been the owners of an import-export business and shipping company. In 1851, Erich Christian Dahl had bought the Sugarhouse (Sukkerhuset) in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim, where there had been a sugar refinery since 1754. Sukkerhuset was rebuilt for brewing. The brewery stayed in the building until 1984.\r\n\r\nThe first bottle of Bayer\u00f8l, a Munich-style dunkel, was sold in 1857. In 1910, the plant began to produce soft drinks at the brewery as well. Bayer\u00f8l was the most important type of beer until the early 20th century when Dahls Pils, a pilsener took over as the most popular beer.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, it was merged with Trondheim Akti Brewery (Trondhjems Aktiebryggeri), which was founded in 1899 and Trondheim Brewery (Trondhjems Bryggeri) which dated to 1919.

A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA. We are servicing several local restaurants, pubs and distributers.

Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:49"},"breweries":[{"id":"UwALod","name":"F\u00e1brica Nortada","nameShortDisplay":"Nortada","website":"https:\/\/loja.fcportuense.pt\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UwALod\/upload_b2Puop-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UwALod\/upload_b2Puop-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UwALod\/upload_b2Puop-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UwALod\/upload_b2Puop-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UwALod\/upload_b2Puop-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-17 19:57:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FMkksU","name":"Headquarters","streetAddress":"210 R. de S\u00e1 da Bandeira","region":"Porto","latitude":41.1479942,"longitude":-8.608168,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"PT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-17 19:57:26","updateDate":"2018-06-19 15:07:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"2:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"2:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-12:00pm-12:00am,wed-12:00pm-12:00am,thu-12:00pm-12:00am,fri-12:00pm-2:00am,sat-12:00pm-2:00am,sun-4:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"Europe\/Lisbon","country":{"isoCode":"PT","name":"PORTUGAL","displayName":"Portugal","isoThree":"PRT","numberCode":620,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mE78nZ","name":"Nortada India Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Nortada India Pale Ale","abv":"6","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-18 06:44:05","updateDate":"2018-07-03 19:46:10","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oc1vfX","name":"North Brewing X Het Uiltje Double IPA","nameDisplay":"North Brewing X Het Uiltje Double IPA","description":"We made a double IPA with our friends at Het Uiltje.
