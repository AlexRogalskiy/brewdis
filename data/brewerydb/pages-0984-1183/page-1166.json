In fact, when it comes to beer tradition, his grandfather George A. Sleeman wrote the book on it - literally. \r\n\r\nJohn's family's brewing tradition in Canada extends back to 1834 when John H. Sleeman arrived in Ontario from Cornwall, England. By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches. \r\n\r\nThe passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.\r\n\r\nAn art as much as a science, beer making depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients. \r\n\r\nPremium brewing employs a time-honoured process in which natural ingredients are blended in myriad combinations and brewed in small batches to produce beers that range from contemporary light brews to 'Old World' dark stouts.","website":"http:\/\/www.sleeman.ca\/","established":"1851","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"q878Wn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"551 Clair Road West","locality":"Guelph","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"0","phone":"1-519-822-1834","latitude":43.4870365,"longitude":-80.2067709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2GsO2X","name":"Original Double Vanilla Ice Cream IIPA","nameDisplay":"Original Double Vanilla Ice Cream IIPA","abv":"8","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2GsO2X\/upload_cnsvXV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2GsO2X\/upload_cnsvXV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2GsO2X\/upload_cnsvXV-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2GsO2X\/upload_cnsvXV-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2GsO2X\/upload_cnsvXV-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2GsO2X\/upload_cnsvXV-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-27 14:27:27","updateDate":"2018-04-27 14:28:14","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

We begin with cull apples, apples that are too small, misshapen, or otherwise undesirable to grocery stores and use those as the base for most of our ciders.\r\n\r\nIn early 2019, we started a brand-new brewery born from a partnership with Dirty Bucket Brewing Co, now all under the name of Locust Cider & Brewing Co. We decided to throw out conventions and start over with a new and unique approach to brewing, inspired by cidermaking methods, delivering easy-to-drink, light-bodied beer while respecting traditions but not being anchored to them.\r\n\r\nOur taprooms and cideries outside of Woodinville are part of an expansion plan to make cider more accessible to a larger audience as well as provide a space to educate on the nuances of the cider world while allowing us to localize our efforts on a deeper level in the communities where we serve.\r\n\r\nWe currently have a cider and beer production facility
