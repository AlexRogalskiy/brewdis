There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

We also have a rotating selection of seasonal brews.

FLBC overlooks the shores of the largest freshwater lake in the West \u2013 and we would argue the most beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 we were honored with becoming the youngest brewery ever to win not just one, but two, World Beer Cup awards. Our brewery brought home a Bronze medal for our Peg Leg Porter and a Silver medal for our Mutiny Stout.\r\n\r\nWe at FLBC work hard, play harder, and do everything to the highest standard. For us, it\u2019s about being leaders in the beer industry, it\u2019s about supporting local and environmental sustainability, and it\u2019s about contributing to the community that has so graciously embraced us.

Generally characterized as very robust. The extremely rich malty flavor and aroma are balanced with assertive hopping and fruity-ester characteristics. Bitterness should be moderately high to very high and balanced with full sweet malt character. Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:49"},"breweries":[{"id":"s0l856","name":"Powder Keg Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Powder Keg","description":"Powder Keg Brewing Company is dedicated to creating a community gathering place rich with conversation, laughter, friends and family.

The most common story about the Moonville\u2019s downfall revolves around a plague befalling the town and the authorities quarantining them and effectively killing them. To try and save them a man with a lantern was placed in the tunnel to flag down a train. The train struck and killed him and the town.
