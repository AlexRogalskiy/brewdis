John Thomas Toohey and his brother James Matthew ran pubs in Melbourne (The Limerick Arms and The Great Britain) before moving to Sydney in the 1860s. They commenced brewing Tooheys Tooheys Black Old Ale in a brewery in the area of present day Darling Harbour. By 1875, demand for their beer had soared and they established The Standard Brewery in inner-city Surry Hills. In 1902, the company went public as Tooheys Limited, and commenced brewing lager (the present day Tooheys New) in 1930. In 1955, the brewery moved west to Lidcombe, where it is currently sited. In 1967, Tooheys bought competitor Miller's Brewers located in Tavener's Hill, closing the brewery in 1975.","website":"http:\/\/www.tooheysnew.com.au\/","established":"1869","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nbraNY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29 Nyrang Street","locality":"Sydney","region":"New South Wales","phone":"1-800-308-388","website":"http:\/\/www.tooheysnew.com.au\/","latitude":-33.8523433,"longitude":151.045122,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","yearOpened":"1869","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"v8afNN","name":"New Again","nameDisplay":"New Again","description":"With one foot in the old world yet firmly rooted in the new, we present this dry-hopped interpretation of a farmhouse ale.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zjTaE3","name":"New Albion Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"New Albion Pale Ale","description":"Re-brewed in partnership with Jack McAuliffe and New Albion, the country's first craft brewer and brewery, this refreshing pale ale's crisp cascade hop character is a craft beer time capsule.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches. We hope to release some our more successful experiments in cans and bottles in the coming years.","website":"http:\/\/moderntimesbeer.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-05 20:35:32","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:31:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"15J7L2HM86","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"P8CiOe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3725 Greenwood St.","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 546-9694","website":"http:\/\/DrinkModern.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  12:00pm -

We want to provide the people of Cape May County beers that will always remind them of home.\r\n\r\nPlease look for our beers on tap in bars and restaurants around Cape May County, and bottled for take home as well. Also, please stop by and see us this fall at 9 Stoney Road in Dennis Township.","website":"http:\/\/tuckahoebrewingcompany.blogspot.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OblNj8\/upload_EVfsKh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OblNj8\/upload_EVfsKh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OblNj8\/upload_EVfsKh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OblNj8\/upload_EVfsKh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OblNj8\/upload_EVfsKh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:06:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"NQLUIOGP3V","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WKlwSy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3096 English Creek Ave","extendedAddress":"Unit 2","locality":"Egg Harbor Township","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08234","phone":"(609) 827-5375","website":"http:\/\/tuckahoebrewingcompany.blogspot.com\/","latitude":39.4204316,"longitude":-74.6176927,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:18:13","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Z3tIWJ","name":"New Buffalo Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"New Buffalo Hefeweizen","description":"Although we have a strong base in brewing English beers, our friends convinced us to try our hand at something a little more continental.

A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character.
