This celebratory lager puts the \u2018fest\u2019 in the month of October.\r\n\r\nWhat started as a community celebration of a royal Bavarian wedding in 1810 has turned into a beer tradition like no other. Over 16 days each fall, some 6 million people head to Munich, don lederhosen and funny hats, gather in enormous tents, and drink oversized steins of beer.
