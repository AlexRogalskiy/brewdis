Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:49"},"breweries":[{"id":"ednIzj","name":"Het Uiltje","nameShortDisplay":"Het Uiltje","website":"http:\/\/www.uiltjecraftbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ednIzj\/upload_DipGjE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ednIzj\/upload_DipGjE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ednIzj\/upload_DipGjE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ednIzj\/upload_DipGjE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ednIzj\/upload_DipGjE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-08 18:56:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eKTJRy","name":"Headquarters","streetAddress":"Zijlstraat 18","locality":"Haarlem, Noord-Holland","phone":"+31 23 844 6227","latitude":52.382878,"longitude":4.6306521,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-08 18:56:29","updateDate":"2017-08-22 16:42:34","timezoneId":"Europe\/Amsterdam","country":{"isoCode":"NL","name":"NETHERLANDS","displayName":"Netherlands","isoThree":"NLD","numberCode":528,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eozV6e","name":"Mind's Eye P.A.","nameDisplay":"Mind's Eye P.A.","description":"Burnt copper color and giant hop aroma come to the forefront in this traditional American IPA.

After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved.  After doing some research they learned that the original name for the majestic Clear Creek that runs through the center of Golden was Cannonball Creek.  The historical significance paired with the duo\u2019s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nKnowing that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it all on their own, Jason and Brian called upon former co-worker and professional brewer Jonathan Lee to help run the tasting room and work in the brewery.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"Jt43j7","name":"New Belgium Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"New Belgium","description":"We'll set the scene: 1989.

What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).\r\n\r\nLater created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"https:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:25:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TN7GC9UK6M","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vEptAb","name":"Miner's Gold","nameDisplay":"Miner's Gold","description":"Our most popular beer is brewed as an unfiltered Hefeweizen in American Wheat Style this beer is light in body and very refreshing ready to quench even the most powerful thirst.

We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.\r\n\r\nThat's our story so far.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
