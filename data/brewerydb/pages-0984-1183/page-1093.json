She is copper in color and showy of her bread, toasted malt, and honey notes. While hopping is reserved, her Fuggle and Willamette additions give pleasant notes of young wood and earth. Even a hibiscus flower is there to accent this beauty. \r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nIPA \u2013 India Pale Ale  \r\n\r\n7.2% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 62 IBU \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere is a common mindset that an IPA has to be very bitter. We don\u2019t agree.  We chose to keep our IPA\u2019s bitterness restrained while packing it full of hop aroma and flavor, thanks to healthy doses of Columbus, Centennial and Chinook hops added after fermentation. It\u2019s pungency of tropical fruit, citrus and earthy spice are displayed over a special blend of domestic and European malts that lend a unique richness to the beer.

But once you get into a good one, it's hard not to find joy in such a hoppy thrill! For our DIPA we dared to seek the implausible: BALANCE, nuanced flavors, and restrained bitterness that defy its massive hopping and higher ABV. We hope you enjoy its nose of honeydew melon and the Herb, followed by lavish flavors of pine, lemon and grapefruit peel, and juicy oranges. Then pair it with bacon-topped anything and heavy metal hair whipping with two goats held high!\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAltbier \u2013 Northern German Amber Beer\r\n\r\n6.3% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 45 IBU\r\n\r\n\r\nAn often unfamiliar and certainly under-appreciated style in the U.S., Altbier is a traditional German amber ale made famous by the regions surrounding D\u00fcsseldorf. An Alt should be nearly brown in color and possess a full-bodied, European malt character that is layered with distinct caramel sweetness and a mild breadiness. Altbiers should finish dry, with a firm noble hop bitterness. We make Amador Brewing Company\u2019s Altbier in just this way, to make the style shine. An amazingly food-friendly beer, give our Alt to your favorite Chef and incredible pairings will follow.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nKolsch \u2013 Kolsch-Style Ale  \r\n\r\n5.2% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 28 IBU\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA Kolsch-Style Ale is essentially a Pilsner that is fermented with an Ale Yeast instead of a Lager Yeast. Fermenting with an Ale Yeast brings subtle tropical aromas and a touch of meyer lemon, which mesh beautifully with herbal tones and spice that come from the Sterling hop. What a Kolsch maintains from a Pilsner are its light, distinctive European malt character and a perfectly crisp finish. A thirst quencher for sure, you can\u2019t go wrong with this beautifully-made Kolsch any time of year!\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\"Kit Carson Pale Ale\" - American Pale Ale\r\n\r\n5.5% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 40 IBU\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCan a beer beckon for adventure? Kit Carson does, with a beautiful coppery color, enticing tropical aromas paralleled by fresh pine, and the white wildflowers of the Sierra. Refreshing, with medium body and a hint of bitterness on the finish, this well-balanced pale ale is perfect for summertime and daydreaming of the good life--whether that's lounging in the tropics, or kayaking remote mountain streams.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nDeep Hop Red \u2013 Red Ale  \r\n\r\n6.6% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 66 IBU \r\n\r\n\r\nA hearty, West-Coast Red by style, but with a focus on kettle hops as opposed to dry hops. Copious late kettle hop additions and a blend of six domestic and European malts create complex flavors at both ends. This beer goes deep and showcases flavors of stone fruit and baker\u2019s bitter chocolate. A can\u2019t lose brew for your backyard BBQ or party.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\"Night Hike Porter\" - Porter\r\n\r\n7.3% ABV \u2013 46 IBU \r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nNight Hike Porter resides proudly between the American Robust Porter and lesser-known Baltic styles. Baltic porters traditionally show influence from Russian Imperial Stout (RIS), and in this context, our porter exhibits dark fruit and roast characters that would be appropriate in RIS, without its often burnt overtones or heaviness.  With a nod to the Baltic style, hints of citrus and mint hop character, and a deceptively drinkable finish, our porter has accompanied many a moonlit country walk. A favorite of the staff and our close friends for years.","abv":"7.3","ibu":"46","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-22 17:56:56","updateDate":"2018-10-22 17:56:56","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

At the end of the day, here in the brewery, it is all about our microscopic wild friends.","website":"http:\/\/www.artifactbeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 19:28:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:20:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PHUCQ9DFMY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hSB1eG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1660 Blue Rock St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45223","latitude":39.1604192,"longitude":-84.5423262,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-26 17:29:26","updateDate":"2015-05-26 17:31:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"1:30am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"1:30am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-12:00am,tue-4:00pm-12:00am,wed-4:00pm-12:00am,thu-4:00pm-12:00am,fri-4:00pm-1:30am,sat-12:00pm-1:30am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","tourInfo":"The brewers will be giving free tours through the brewery every Saturday and Sunday at 1:00pm and 3:00pm each day.

Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them.

We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0dkfNX","name":"Night Saison","nameDisplay":"Night Saison","description":"Aged with sour raspberries.","abv":"7.5","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-13 18:37:02","updateDate":"2016-12-13 18:37:02","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Brown and Sons (now Heaven Hill) and were coopered in the early 1960\u2019s. The resulting beer is deep, dark, and intense in flavour with notes of oak, roasted barley, black malts, vanilla, and whisky.\r\nThere were a very limited number of NZ Whiskey Co. barrels, and we can coax the whiskey character out of a barrel and into a beer only once. After that, the barrel may offer oak flavour, but the whiskey character is essentially lost. Each bottle is hand numbered. The 2017 release is sold out. Annual releases are planned for 2018 \u2013 2021 and supply is very limited.\r\n\r\nCount yourself fortunate if you are lucky enough to get your hands on some of these bottles. It is a unique experience which can\u2019t be repeated and the beer will age gracefully for years. We expect the sweet spot to be around 3-5 years. Do not serve cold!

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":84,"name":"Mount Hood","description":"A triploid released in 1983 as part of a program attempting to develop an American substitute for Hallertauer Mittelfr?h, Mount Hood was a cross between a tetraploid Hallertauer and an unnamed aroma variety derived from Early Green.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
