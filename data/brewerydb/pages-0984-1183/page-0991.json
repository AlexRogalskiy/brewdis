We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind, and we continually build on that sentiment, by delivering a unique experience and award winning beers to meet the changing demands of the craft beer community.","website":"http:\/\/www.capitalbrewery.com\/","established":"1984","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001QKOUjm76P7aUowbU3bchMmLlIKSnJ2dJN7B3SnkK1I-Dde4Q3J1O8o_MbR3cMmc9UYntPMmGLsuW8he0ZzVEDAGaJ2Jp9MbLzBs7xf-IS0iQq4FuDhj02K5Wn2ywuNqT","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:15:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MSP6CET3KF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"1g0RBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7734 Terrace Avenue","locality":"Middleton","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53562","phone":"608-836-7100","website":"http:\/\/www.capital-brewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\r\nTuesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nWednesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nThursday: 4:00pm-9:00pm \r\nFriday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm","latitude":43.094848,"longitude":-89.5165838,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:03","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-4:00pm-9:00pm,wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-5:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\r\nTuesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nWednesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nThursday: 4:00pm-9:00pm \r\nFriday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jupozU","name":"Maibock","nameDisplay":"Maibock","description":"A smooth malty flavor attained from the richness of Munich malts that finishes with gentle warming sweetness.

You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2\/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer. We are small but hungry\u2026we mean thirsty.","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:26:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6EMUTIVHSQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1irs0u","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"234 Carpenter Street","locality":"Greenport","region":"New York","postalCode":"11944","phone":"631-477-6681","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open for Tastings\/Growlers\/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","latitude":41.1024718,"longitude":-72.3589459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Open for Tastings\/Growlers\/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gs8wAj","name":"Maibock","nameDisplay":"Maibock","styleId":89,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:17:28","updateDate":"2017-09-18 19:39:18","style":{"id":89,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Heller Bock\/Maibock","shortName":"Maibock","description":"The German word helle means light colored, and as such, a heller Bock is light straw to deep golden in color.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo .

Gordon Biersch Maibock achieves its rich malty flavor from dark roasted caramel malt, and lots of it. Originally brewed in the 14th century in the town of Einbeck, Germany, it quickly became a favorite style in Bavaria. One of the Bavarian brewers actually enticed a brewer from the North to move to Bavaria where the style was popularized. Maibock is a great beer to accompany robust flavors. The rich flavor from the dark-roasted caramel malt complements the moderate level of bitterness to create a perfect balance.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:56:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AK23DS9YUB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-11:00pm,sat-2:00pm-11:00pm,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4weWVW","name":"Maibock","nameDisplay":"Maibock","description":"As temperatures rise teasing that summer is near and another winter is behind us, spring is the perfect time of year to celebrate new growth.
