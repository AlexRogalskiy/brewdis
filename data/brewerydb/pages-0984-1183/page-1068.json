Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:54:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8tHhXL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Fugleb\u00e6kvej 2 C","region":"Kastrup","postalCode":"2770","phone":"+45 32 50 62 00 \u200e","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","latitude":55.624252,"longitude":12.595661,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DK","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:55:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DK","name":"DENMARK","displayName":"Denmark","isoThree":"DNK","numberCode":208,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UQsGoM","name":"Mrs. O'Leary's Chocolate Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Mrs. O'Leary's Chocolate Milk Stout","description":"Don't fight it, Spite It!\r\n\r\nSo this is what we heard...\r\n\r\nMrs. O'Leary was excessively milking her cow, because\r\n\r\nshe owed money all over town.

In 2010 we planted our flag in Downtown Fresno, CA and decided to take our journey of becoming the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s local brewery a step further. Our beer and brands reflect the greatness of the region we brew in. We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master\/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.\r\n\r\nAll Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California. We recently renovated our grain warehouse to become a tasting room in a Beer Garden style fashion.

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.\r\n\r\nWe have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.","website":"http:\/\/www.goodpeoplebrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:24:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"C7N3FGZSB0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"pj4HJk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"114 14th Street South","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35223","website":"http:\/\/www.goodpeoplebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Taproom Hours\r\nWednesday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nThursday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nFriday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nSaturday: 1pm - 4pm","latitude":33.50713,"longitude":-86.811894,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Taproom Hours\r\nWednesday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nThursday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nFriday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nSaturday: 1pm - 4pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VvSGLe","name":"Mucho Aloha Haupia Cream Ale","nameDisplay":"Mucho Aloha Haupia Cream Ale","abv":"4.5","glasswareId":5,"styleId":109,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VvSGLe\/upload_UlQIun-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VvSGLe\/upload_UlQIun-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VvSGLe\/upload_UlQIun-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VvSGLe\/upload_UlQIun-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VvSGLe\/upload_UlQIun-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VvSGLe\/upload_UlQIun-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-28 12:57:34","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:30:15","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":109,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Cream Ale or Lager","shortName":"Cream Ale","description":"Mild, pale, light-bodied ale, made using a warm fermentation (top or bottom) and cold lagering.
