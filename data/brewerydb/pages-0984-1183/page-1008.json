Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"oIYpLB","name":"Batch Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Batch","description":"Once upon a time, not too long ago, we were Detroit's first Nano Brewery.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"CfJ0cK","name":"Martini-Brauerei","nameShortDisplay":"Martini-Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.martini-brauerei.de\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fuWdQt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Klnische Strae 94-104","locality":"Kassel","region":"Hessen","phone":"49-(0)561-\/-7885-0","latitude":51.31754,"longitude":9.47932,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TOGQNb","name":"Martini N\u00f6rten-Hardenberger Pils","nameDisplay":"Martini N\u00f6rten-Hardenberger Pils","styleId":106,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:09:49","updateDate":"2015-05-28 18:49:13","style":{"id":106,"categoryId":10,"category":{"id":10,"name":"International Styles","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"International-Style Pilsener","shortName":"International Pilsener","description":"International Pilseners are straw\/golden in color and are well attenuated.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"CfJ0cK","name":"Martini-Brauerei","nameShortDisplay":"Martini-Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.martini-brauerei.de\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CfJ0cK\/upload_jkgPTV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fuWdQt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Klnische Strae 94-104","locality":"Kassel","region":"Hessen","phone":"49-(0)561-\/-7885-0","latitude":51.31754,"longitude":9.47932,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
