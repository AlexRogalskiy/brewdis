Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchener Str. 21, 85653, Germany","region":"Aying","postalCode":"85653","phone":"49080958890","latitude":47.972169,"longitude":11.773846,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2017-08-23 12:59:17","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","tourInfo":"Regular guided tours of the brewery in German\r\n(not including food):\r\nTuesdays at 11 a.m.\r\nThursdays at 6 p.m.\r\nSaturdays at 10 a.m.\r\nGroup tours required in other languages than German: by arrangement.\r\n\r\nBeer Culture Experience for corporate groups, \r\nassociations and clubs:\r\nGuided tour of the brewery with beer tasting and a typical\r\nBavarian delicacy. \r\nWe are always happy to provide any \r\nadditional information you may require.","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"s7vM0W","name":"Maibock","nameDisplay":"Maibock","styleId":3,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:39","updateDate":"2014-10-07 19:26:07","style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"axkOnh","name":"ChristophBr\u00e4u","nameShortDisplay":"ChristophBr\u00e4u","website":"http:\/\/www.christophbraeu.de\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"h6TO1Z","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Alois-Degler-Stra\u00dfe 3","locality":"Gaggenau","postalCode":"76571","latitude":48.804727,"longitude":8.316305,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 12:26:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ruCW0N","name":"Maibock","nameDisplay":"Maibock","description":"Big and malty.

It was a modest beginning with some obstacles, but enthusiasm prevailed and thanks to the support of our loyal customers, it was a success! Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District. The Railyard area is a busy arts and entertainment district, where you can find a different show, market or exhibit every day of the week. Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"atDMAs","name":"Rheinhessen-Br\u00e4u Reiterstube","nameShortDisplay":"Rheinhessen-Br\u00e4u Reiterstube","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"JUjEnp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Reiterweg 15","locality":"Mainz-Ebersheim","region":"Rheinland-Pfalz","postalCode":"D-55129","latitude":49.91798,"longitude":8.24468,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:46","updateDate":"2017-08-23 02:48:43","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vaGht1","name":"Maibock","nameDisplay":"Maibock","abv":"6.4","ibu":"30","styleId":89,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-19 16:40:23","updateDate":"2018-06-19 16:44:04","style":{"id":89,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Heller Bock\/Maibock","shortName":"Maibock","description":"The German word helle means light colored, and as such, a heller Bock is light straw to deep golden in color.

Thanks to this crazy new bar in Winnetka, CA and our buddy the bartender, we were introduced to new styles of beer that were much different than the commercial brands we were used to. After many conversations on the process of making beer and the brewing techniques of smaller breweries, we decided to take a chance at brewing our own malted, adult beverages! \r\n\r\nWe signed up for a Maltose Falcons class, bought a brewing kit and a turkey fryer and made a batch of beer on June 23, 2012. After this first batch, we were hooked! We invested more time in learning about the process, fabricated custom brewing equipment and experimented with new recipes while tweaking them to make them our own. \r\n\r\nAfter serving samples of our homemade brews and getting positive feedback, we began talking of doing it legit and opening up a brewery!  Given our Valley roots and the fact our beer was brewed out of a garage in Sylmar, CA, we decided 818 Brewing was the perfect name and we filed our paperwork in October 2014 for our new venture.\r\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ve enjoyed the most along our journey is the sense of community within the craft brew scene. Not many products can bring together men and women of different nationalities, age groups, religious beliefs, income levels, political views \u2013 and even fellow brewers! \u2013 And create a moment of common ground.  8 one 8 Brewing is proud to offer a product that brings us together to say cheers!","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home\/?age-verified=cd0a2fef44","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:30:46","updateDate":"2019-07-02 19:08:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AH21G7RNY4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"GTwDJI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8951 De Soto Ave.","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:31:54","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"73xdsm","name":"8one8 brewery","streetAddress":"8951 de soto ave","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-08-09 23:43:32","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:44","forwardingId":"GTwDJI","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"l13hus","name":"Maibock Hurts Like Helles","nameDisplay":"Maibock Hurts Like Helles","description":"True Story!

Our goal is to create something that with each vintage evokes the same spirit of adventure, sense of the unknown and enjoyment of the journey. \r\n\r\nWe take a carefully crafted American Hoppy Barley Wine and then age it in various barrels for the year, with the goal of bringing them together in a harmonious blend prior to bottling. This journey means that each individual barrel will impart different characteristics on the beer, sometimes from the quality and type of wood used, but more potent the liquid stored in it previously. \r\n\r\nMaiden releases are always regarded for their depth of flavour and complexity of barrel notes. This year's blend consists of 20% Fresh Maiden, 10% Armagnac, 10% Banyuls, 20% Heaven Hill, 30% Red Wine and 10% Rum (in ex-Jack Daniels barrels). This year\u2019s beer pours a deep ruby colour and has a vinous aroma with hints of caramel and liquorice. It\u2019s a rich experience when drinking, with toffee, fig roll sweetness, red berries and a well-rounded oak character bringing everything together. \r\n\r\nWe love it! As always with Maiden, we think it tastes great now, and it's already spent a lot of time maturing in barrels. But it will also continue to age nicely. We've supplied no best before date, only a 'bottled on' - so drink at your leisure or save for a special occasion.","abv":"11.2","styleId":17,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2016,"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-01 22:06:41","updateDate":"2019-02-22 16:00:05","style":{"id":17,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"British Barleywine","description":"British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"KBQTlS","name":"Brenner Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Brenner","description":"Brenner Brewing Co. is a microbrewery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness).
