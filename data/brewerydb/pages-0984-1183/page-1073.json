This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"77YOgn","name":"Front Street Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Front Street","description":"Located in Historic Downtown, the Front Street Brewery is Wilmington\u2019s only Restaurant with its own Brewery.

You  can hear two things happen at Noon: the Noon Whistle and the  opening of a fresh beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.noonwhistlebrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-24 15:11:25","updateDate":"2019-06-18 18:14:50","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PQSKYM9A3N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S4gwnP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"800 E Roosevelt Rd","locality":"Lombard","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60148","website":"http:\/\/www.noonwhistlebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm","latitude":41.8621611,"longitude":-88.0006379,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-24 15:11:25","updateDate":"2017-08-22 17:20:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1wQQW9","name":"Muscles From Brussels","nameDisplay":"Muscles From Brussels","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-05 19:46:40","updateDate":"2014-09-07 15:07:28","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.
