Herman\u2019s desire to expand the market for the family\u2019s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           \r\n\r\n   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff\u2019s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.","website":"http:\/\/berghoffbeer.com\/","established":"1887","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:24:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kU9sBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3122 W.

Decoction mashing is an old process which harkens back to continental Europe that allowed brewers to extract sugars from under-modified malts more effectively.  It is no longer necessary to efficiently extract the sugars but with our malt forward lagers, decoction mashing produces a melanoidin-laden wort, which our yeast turns into in a truly complex and well-balanced Montana-made beer.  Sure, we could try to compensate with specialty grains, but it just wouldn't taste the same. With our lager beers, we\u2019re after superior taste.

The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits.

They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place\/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:45:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:04:40","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DYK2HE3MXW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"hMvwjg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4500 5th Ave South","extendedAddress":"Building C","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"205-578-2616","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","latitude":33.526729,"longitude":-86.764854,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:46:42","updateDate":"2016-02-02 17:43:17","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KzWCBY","name":"Oktoberfest Bier","nameDisplay":"Oktoberfest Bier","glasswareId":5,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzWCBY\/upload_Pyh7mM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzWCBY\/upload_Pyh7mM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzWCBY\/upload_Pyh7mM-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzWCBY\/upload_Pyh7mM-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzWCBY\/upload_Pyh7mM-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzWCBY\/upload_Pyh7mM-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:50","updateDate":"2015-12-16 10:14:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.

Second, we have dry hopped our beer! Of course we have selected the perfect aroma German variety - Hallertau Mittelfruh - which added to the brewing kettle during boiling as well as to the fermentation tank later for dry hopping. This hop gives a beautiful flower flavours to our beer. Finally, this beer is a bit more stronger that usual one in this style. We suppose that it would be a plus only for the late Russian autumn.

Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District.

Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility.

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:57:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2T1Q06HRXP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
