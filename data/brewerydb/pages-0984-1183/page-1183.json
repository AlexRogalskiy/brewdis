We never focus on pleasing just one style since we love just about all of them and while not every beer we brew will be the perfect student in its category it will be one that will get the craft beer loving palate craving more with each sip.","website":"http:\/\/chainreactionbrewingco.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-23 11:26:33","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:15:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WZN7KMB4PF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"iYshKM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"902 S Lipan St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80223","phone":"1-303-922-0960","website":"http:\/\/chainreactionbrewingco.com","latitude":39.6995433,"longitude":-105.0012001,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-23 11:27:11","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:50:06","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"paERb9","name":"Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Pale Ale","abv":"6.2","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/paERb9\/upload_T2Tm27-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/paERb9\/upload_T2Tm27-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/paERb9\/upload_T2Tm27-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/paERb9\/upload_T2Tm27-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/paERb9\/upload_T2Tm27-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/paERb9\/upload_T2Tm27-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:54","updateDate":"2015-12-16 11:11:40","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Some time much further down the track they talked about starting a business together. This discussion almost certainly occurred over a beer. Doing what? The answer was right in front of them.\r\n\r\nAndy (Andrew Larsen) had already spent fourteen years in the beer industry. As a brewer and brewing consultant, his business Breowan Systems is a leading player in everything to do with brewing, and Andy works with fellow brewers all around the globe. But what Andy wanted more than anything else, more than a drive in a rally car, more than a Stratocaster, was a brewery in his hometown. Somewhere he could cruise down to on a Sunday with his daughter Katherine, lay a brew down, and listen to some Bailterspace, turned up loud.\r\n\r\nAnt (Anthony Browne) was a suit and tie wearer until 2010. As a beer drinker and lover of all good things in life, he was inevitably drawn to craft beer. After a year and a half of bumming around, some travel and a bit of study, in May 2012 Andy convinced Ant to join him for a week in Melbourne. Good Beer Week to be precise. Not much convincing was necessary. Andy showed Ant what his work in the Aussie beer industry made clear.\r\n\r\nThat restaurant menus need not be a let-down when you get to the beer list. That pubs can serve beers from little breweries, not just the big guys. And that there is a growing number of people that want more than golden lagers and brown ales. Trips to Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington followed, after which Ant was forced to admit that his beloved home-town of Auckland was missing out.\r\n\r\nSo what to do then? A brewery, certainly. But we also wanted to stock beers from all over the world, to keep discovering. And we wanted to offer the flexibility to have a beer at our place, or take some home. Preferably both :-)\r\n\r\nAfter three months planning, constructing and creating, on the 5th of December we opened the Retail Store and Beer Tasting Lounge.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 we outgrew our little brewery and opened up Juke Joint, our new mothership in Mt Eden. Home to our BBQ smokehouse and new, expanded brewery. We started bottling our beer and got it out to the best restaurants, cafes, bars and bottle shops all over Auckland.\r\n\r\nSince then we've broadened our horizons to our Barrel Room out in Orakei where we're serving up gourmet burgers and our signature range of world class beers to the good people of the Eastern Bays.

We brew a number of styles and try to keep them rotating throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, we brew ales, namely: Pale Ale, Double IPA, Amber Ale, Porter, Oatmeal Stout (coming soon), and British mild.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions, though, we have been known to break out a keg of lager or two.  In the past we've served: Bohemian Pilsner and Octoberfest (Marzen).  Sometime this summer we will debut our Vienna Lager.","website":"http:\/\/www.arborvine.com\/deepwater-brewing-company","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JZGHQe\/upload_otKv3Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JZGHQe\/upload_otKv3Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JZGHQe\/upload_otKv3Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JZGHQe\/upload_otKv3Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JZGHQe\/upload_otKv3Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-18 13:54:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:34:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GA4Z037O5D","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"rQGXXT","name":"Upper Main Street","streetAddress":"33 Tenney Hill","locality":"Blue Hill","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04614","phone":"(207) 374-2441.","website":"http:\/\/www.deepwaterbrewing.com","latitude":44.4110696,"longitude":-68.5927809,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-19 01:48:11","updateDate":"2015-06-02 13:30:51","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YeMeYY","name":"Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Pale Ale","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-01 01:33:26","updateDate":"2017-09-18 19:04:54","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.
