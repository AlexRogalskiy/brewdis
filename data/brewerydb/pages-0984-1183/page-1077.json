Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"ZKLrEQ","name":"Choice Bros Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Choice Bros","description":"Choice Bros are known for their innovative, experimental and occasional mad beers.  \r\nWith balance and a respect for both malt & hops, the beers created by the Bros have been extremely well received, broadening horizons of many drinkers along the way.","website":"http:\/\/www.choicebros.co.nz\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 17:42:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"RTwp27","name":"Choice Bros Brewing - HUSK","streetAddress":"62 Ghuznee St","extendedAddress":"Te Aro","region":"Wellington","postalCode":"6011","phone":"64 4-282 0583","website":"http:\/\/huskbar.co.nz\/brewery\/","latitude":-41.2929556,"longitude":174.7751361,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 17:47:03","updateDate":"2018-07-17 17:47:32","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-8:00am-10:00pm,thu-8:00am-11:00pm,fri-8:00am-12:00am,sat-9:00am-12:00am,sun-9:00am-10:00pm,mon-8:00am-10:00pm,tue-8:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"k4ouNK","name":"Naked Jane","nameDisplay":"Naked Jane","description":"Jane is tired of getting overlooked for the dancing-on-the-bar types when she has that subtle, girl-next-door thing going on.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:33:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QUG9N370X2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lAcrbq","name":"Gadsden","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-5:00pm-9:00pm,thu-5:00pm-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"heKnGb","name":"Birmingham","streetAddress":"3201 1st Avenue North","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"(205) 407-8025","website":"https:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/birmingham","latitude":33.5221355,"longitude":-86.7882994,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-10-14 19:57:28","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-3:00pm-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bkJcDD","name":"Naked Pilgrim","nameDisplay":"Naked Pilgrim","description":"Unfiltered, this New England style IPA has a soft opaque haziness from the healthy quantities of wheat and oats.

It finishes with a star of anise spiciness that makes you think this somewhat fruit-forward brew could be paired with herb-crusted chicken for dinner, and also with lemon tart for dessert.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"40","srmId":6,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-19 20:24:37","updateDate":"2016-01-20 18:24:33","srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"VTZFzZ","name":"Apex Predator Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Apex Predator","description":"Think of Apex Predator Brewing as a beacon for craft beer in Alberta, exploring the untouched wilds in search of new flavours before anyone else.
