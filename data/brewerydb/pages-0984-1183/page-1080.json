For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter).

Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

As part of its commitment to sustainability, the slow food movement and Texas, Jester King beer uses as many organic and local ingredients as possible and will soon be brewed with harvested rainwater.","website":"http:\/\/www.jesterkingbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/jesterkingbrewery.us2.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=6f34dbbfef5b3f1e8acd76313&id=0c0f75758f","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:25:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TIV2ANES51","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"M4K0XQ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"13005 Fitzhugh Rd","extendedAddress":"Bld.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BtHXzf","name":"naturbelassenes Kellerbier","nameDisplay":"naturbelassenes Kellerbier","abv":"4.9","styleId":56,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-14 19:28:34","updateDate":"2016-05-11 00:12:55","style":{"id":56,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Kellerbier (Cellar beer) or Zwickelbier - Ale","shortName":"Kellerbier","description":"These beers are unfiltered German-style Altbier and K\u00f6lsch.

For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer important how advanced we are and how much technical support we use during our daily processes. The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: \"Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served\" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","established":"1590","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vPPBkD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Schlossbr\u00e4ugasse 2","locality":"Au in der Hallertau","postalCode":"84072","phone":"+49 \/ 87 52 \/ 86 32","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","latitude":48.558307,"longitude":11.741228,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","yearOpened":"1590","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"t27IPY","name":"Nature Loves to Hide","nameDisplay":"Nature Loves to Hide","abv":"5","styleId":92,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 16:29:39","updateDate":"2018-05-10 18:58:33","style":{"id":92,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Kellerbier (Cellar beer) or Zwickelbier - Lager","shortName":"Kellerbier","description":"Traditional Version of Kellerbier: Unfiltered lagered versions of Germanic lager styles of beer such as M\u00fcnchner-Style Helles and Dunkel, Dortmunder\/European-Style Export, Bohemian-style Pilsener and German-style Pilsener.
