Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"eOm6Xk","name":"Butcher's Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Butcher's","description":"Butcher's Brewing\u2122, located in Barrio Logan near the Padres ballpark and trendy East Village, is scheduled to open in September, 2010.

In order to make this place extra spectacular, the Maitas partnered with general and managing partner of local favorites Bridges and the Vine, Randy Negi. We knew this alliance would ensure we compliment great craft beer with incredible food. Put our passions together, and a fun spot called Danville Brewing Co. is born. Our head brewer, Matt Sager is a UC Davis Master Brewers program graduate and has been an award winning brewer for 20 years.

It has been a wonderful and stressful journey so far and we can't wait to see where it takes us next.","website":"http:\/\/wetheadbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 05:07:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"diJ77A","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"513 A St. NE","locality":"Auburn","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98001","website":"http:\/\/wetheadbrewery.com","latitude":47.3125924,"longitude":-122.2288865,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 14:10:55","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:37:19","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CGenPX","name":"Mud Mountain Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Mud Mountain Milk Stout","description":"Our award winning Mud Mountain Milk Stout is as smooth as chocolate silk.

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"sk5YLK","name":"Buffalo Bayou Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Buffalo Bayou","description":"Buffalo Bayou Brewing Company is a new twist on an old craft.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"y0Q23K","name":"Birdboy Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Birdboy Brewing","description":"Birdboy Brewing company is a locally owned and operated Fort Wayne brewery committed to offering the city's finest craft beer.

It's actually an oatmeal stout if you want to get right down to it.\r\n\r\n A series of happy accidents lead to the Muddy Creek recipe. It truly was a long time in the making. The stout developed over years of trial and error until the perfect storm came together to create the right texture and flavor profile.\r\n\r\n Muddy Creek is pleasant not only for its flavor but for its fullness and complexity. Generally a \"chocolate stout\" is so named for it's color, not specifically for any particular flavor profiles. In fact, stouts are more notable for strong coffee or roasted barley flavors than anything else. However, in the case of Muddy Creek, we have actually made efforts to incorporate chocolate flavors into the recipe which enhance the aroma, flavor and natural bitterness of the stout. These flavors mix naturally with the coffee undercurrent of the stout to form a nice blend. Add the silky mouth-feel from the oats and you have a very unique experience.\r\n\r\n We were so happy with how Muddy Creek turned out as a beer that we named the brewery after it. We hope you'll like it too. We currently serve our stout on both CO2 and on Nitro.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:57:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2T1Q06HRXP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
