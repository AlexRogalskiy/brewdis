Traditionally, M\u00e4rzenbier is a pale lager that originated in Bavaria before the 16th century and was consumed throughout Oktoberfest at the end of September. Our M\u00e4rzen is a vibrant orange color. You will get caramel and biscuit aromas leading to a malty, mellow, and mild taste. Enjoy this seasonal while it lasts.","abv":"5.4","ibu":"18","styleId":82,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ocK2GQ\/upload_nTqAuA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ocK2GQ\/upload_nTqAuA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ocK2GQ\/upload_nTqAuA-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ocK2GQ\/upload_nTqAuA-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ocK2GQ\/upload_nTqAuA-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ocK2GQ\/upload_nTqAuA-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pierogies, Schweinhax'n, Pork, Venison","createDate":"2014-10-15 18:59:29","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:48:12","style":{"id":82,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Oktoberfest \/ Wiesen (Meadow)","shortName":"Oktoberfest","description":"Today's Oktoberfest beers are characterized by a medium body and light, golden color.

It was also the beer served at the Original Oktoberfest celebration, which originated as a wedding reception for the King Ludwig I and Maria Theresa. Bavaria was a very poor country and had little cause for celebration, so the King and Queen invited the entire population of Bavaria to the reception. They showed up that year and every year thereafter, and the event evolved into the modern day Oktoberfest. Gordon Biersch M\u00e4rzen accentuates the flavors of the dark roasted imported malted barley and exhibits a caramel malt aftertaste, while downplaying the hop level.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"18","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zomWCT\/upload_tVQK26-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zomWCT\/upload_tVQK26-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zomWCT\/upload_tVQK26-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zomWCT\/upload_tVQK26-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zomWCT\/upload_tVQK26-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zomWCT\/upload_tVQK26-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:45","updateDate":"2015-12-16 03:49:13","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.
