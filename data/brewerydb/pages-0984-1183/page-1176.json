Historically, traditional gueuze lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners.

In 2016, Black Project expanded production with a small addition to the property which allowed for the expansion of their barrel program. This allowed the brewery to evolve from Former Future Brewing Company to only serving Black Project beers. In 2017, Black Project hopes to produce 250 BBL of beer and increase distribution.\r\n\r\nEvery Black Project beer is fermented with microbes captured from the local environment via a coolship or foraged from nature. We believe this creates a beer that is unrivaled in complexity. Our beers are intended to have a sense of place, or terroir. No matter how hard one tried to, our beer cannot be replicated outside of our brewery. In fact, our microbe cultures are purposefully allowed to evolve from batch to batch, creating variations and interesting twists from different releases of the same beer. \r\n\r\nWe are meticulous about designing recipes and processes that will allow nature to take over and create beers unrivaled in their beauty and complexity. Through experimentation and research, we are continuously developing new and different techniques for use with wild and spontaneous fermentation.\r\n\r\nWe are not and do not have any intention of being a Lambic brewery. We use science and experimentation to find which processes and ingredients we want and often use that in parallel to traditional Lambic producers, however, other than the use of a coolship, we maintain no strict adherence to tradition for tradition's sake. Spontaneous fermentation is merely a starting point and core of our process, from there our research and development extends much beyond the scope of the great Belgian brewers and blenders.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackprojectbeer.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/blackprojectenlist","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-25 18:19:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZIWKX6PJO3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"pfxJGR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1290 South Broadway","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80210","latitude":39.6933944,"longitude":-104.9870534,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-25 18:21:14","updateDate":"2016-10-25 18:21:14","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"M4vcO7","name":"Oxford Comma","nameDisplay":"Oxford Comma","abv":"5.1","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 23:31:09","updateDate":"2018-06-27 18:56:17","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.\r\n\r\nInsane?...No, we're having the time of our lives!","website":"http:\/\/www.pineyriverbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:51:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TZF7SNJCRV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"TKwUTr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15194 Walnut Grove Drive","locality":"Bucyrus","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65444","phone":"417-967-6786","website":"http:\/\/www.pineyriverbrewing.com\/","latitude":37.3208964,"longitude":-92.0165208,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8iEcD1","name":"Ozo Coffee Brown","nameDisplay":"Ozo Coffee Brown","abv":"6.7","ibu":"45","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-03 20:30:37","updateDate":"2016-08-03 20:30:38","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels.

We don\u2019t shy away from paying a bit more for exactly what we want, like the Mosaic hop in the Lightning Tree IPA.  Asa ferments the beer using a variety of different yeast strains to keep each beer tasting unique, and he filters all the ales except the Witbier.  Our custom built stainless steel glycol-jacketed brewery helps Asa get the results that he wants.
