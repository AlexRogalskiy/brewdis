They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer \u2013 Scott Vincent \u2013 leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NorULV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"89 Bertie Street,","locality":"Port Melbourne","region":"VIC","postalCode":"3207","phone":"(03) 9673 4545","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","hoursOfOperation":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","latitude":-37.8286099,"longitude":144.9371032,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LEQyCT","name":"Minimum: Idaho 7","nameDisplay":"Minimum: Idaho 7","description":"Our freshest batch of the series celebrates Idaho 7.

Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.","website":"http:\/\/www.rushriverbeer.com","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:06:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"59VMAKCNX3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hHD54O","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"990 Antler Court","locality":"River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54022","phone":"1-715-426-2054","latitude":44.8902357,"longitude":-92.6377675,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XLsZZl","name":"Mink the Mischief Maker","nameDisplay":"Mink the Mischief Maker","description":"Fruity american hops compliment the belgian yeast character.

Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"pon8z2","name":"Excelsior Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Excelsior","description":"Our mission is to celebrate the rich history of Lake Minnetonka and historic Excelsior by delivering superior brews hand-crafted in their image.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"K6BOqs","name":"Blue and Gray Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Blue and Gray","description":"The Blue & Gray Brewing Co. opened in Fredericksburg on March 17, 2002.

Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.
