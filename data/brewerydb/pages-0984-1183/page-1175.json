There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"iJqDBl","name":"Atypical Brewery & Barrelworks","nameShortDisplay":"Atypical Brewery & Barrelworks","description":"Microbrewery specializing in Barrel Aged sour beers and other unique flavors.","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AtypicalBrew\/","established":"2018","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iJqDBl\/upload_b0RL9B-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iJqDBl\/upload_b0RL9B-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iJqDBl\/upload_b0RL9B-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iJqDBl\/upload_b0RL9B-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iJqDBl\/upload_b0RL9B-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-18 19:00:21","updateDate":"2019-06-19 17:11:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"UNZcbE","name":"Atypical Brewery & Barrelworks","streetAddress":"510 North Central Ave East","locality":"Minot","region":"North Dakota","postalCode":"58701","latitude":48.2364128,"longitude":-101.2852911,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-19 17:10:42","updateDate":"2019-06-19 17:10:42","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-4:00pm-10:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pDwamg","name":"Overdrive","nameDisplay":"Overdrive","description":"THIS TROPICAL STORM of an IIPA blends citrus and stone fruit hops, a new yeast variety that is tropical, and is then further infused with mangoes and peaches.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"beerVariation":{"id":"3zb9Gq","name":"Ovila Dubbel","nameDisplay":"Ovila Dubbel","abv":"7.5","styleId":58,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-20 00:45:49","updateDate":"2017-01-10 21:39:39","style":{"id":58,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","shortName":"Belgian Dubbel","description":"This medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale has a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:15:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MPZR37EQWD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VyU5eV","name":"OW!

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
