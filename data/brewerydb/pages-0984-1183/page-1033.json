This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"fe44im","name":"The Black Abbey Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"The Black Abbey","description":"\u201cSt. Anne, help me!

To prove to you that the horrible mead your best friend made one time in college is NOT what a good mead should taste like. To show you that mead doesn't HAVE to be sweet. To educate you on the different styles of mead. To bring mead into the mainstream, but still maintain our integrity. To everyday thank my mom and tell her that I love her (shouldn't we all?).","website":"http:\/\/www.bnektar.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GOh8Oi\/upload_NhQKGQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GOh8Oi\/upload_NhQKGQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GOh8Oi\/upload_NhQKGQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GOh8Oi\/upload_NhQKGQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GOh8Oi\/upload_NhQKGQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-24 11:58:59","updateDate":"2019-03-26 19:07:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H9OAM1VL2K","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"aQpHNT","name":"Main Meadery","streetAddress":"1481 Wordsworth","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Ferndale","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48220","phone":"(313) 744-6323","website":"http:\/\/www.bnektar.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri: 5:30 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 7:00 pm","latitude":42.453829,"longitude":-83.1139,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-24 12:01:16","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:41","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"5:30pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-5:30pm-10:00pm,sat-1:00pm-7:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fri: 5:30 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 7:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"m1HuGh","name":"Mike's Blend","nameDisplay":"Mike's Blend","description":"Combines 1\/3 of our Third \r\n Street Ale with 2\/3 of our \r\n State Street Pilsner.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"nvBZvJ","name":"Stockholms Vardshus","nameShortDisplay":"Stockholms Vardshus","website":"http:\/\/www.stockholmsbrewpub.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:01:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8EXC6SM219","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mzDbI2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"306 W State St","locality":"Geneva","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60134","phone":"630-208-1400","website":"http:\/\/www.stockholmsbrewpub.com\/","latitude":41.8877604,"longitude":-88.3083238,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"w3Qg21","name":"Mike's Camaro","nameDisplay":"Mike's Camaro","abv":"6","styleId":110,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-25 15:20:40","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:00:14","style":{"id":110,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"California Common Beer","shortName":"California Common","description":"California Common Beer is light amber to amber in color and is medium bodied.
