We just gained a new brewery here in Brooklyn. A few months ago, we busted through the brewhouse wall into another building and expanded our fermentation cellars.Now we\u2019ve just finished installing a big shiny new set of German brewhouse equipment. Over the coming years, we\u2019re going to brew you a lot of fun new beers on this baby.\r\nFirst, though, it\u2019s time to rev this whole thing up and get it humming. The first beer out of our new brewhouse is Brooklyn Main Engine Start, a burnishedgold ale in the rare \u201cAbbey Singel\u201d style, reminiscent of the un-filtered beers that Trappist monks make for themselves. It\u2019s dry and biscuity on the palate, with a lilt of spicy Belgian yeast character and a snappy hop bite. Judicious dry hopping with Slovenian Aurora hops lends an appetizing herbal note. It\u2019s tasty enough to stick with for the whole evening, and at about 6% ABV, it won\u2019t have you tripping over snow banks after just one.\r\nWe know it\u2019s winter and you might have been expecting something heavy and dark, but right now we\u2019re just not in a heavy and dark mood. In fact, we\u2019re feeling pretty cheerful, and we want to celebrate with a bunch of our friends and a few pints of beer. If you\u2019re in the neighborhood, stop by during our tour hours and see the new brewery. If you\u2019ve seen the brewery before, you\u2019ll be amazed what we\u2019ve done with the place.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"VJ56AP","name":"Yaletown Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Yaletown","description":"The Yaletown Brewing Company is Vancouver's original and best Brewpub.
