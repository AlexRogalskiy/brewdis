The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

I don't know that we recognized at the time that it was a life altering event; but, mostly out of desire to have more mead in our lives that measured up to the quality we had experienced from them we decided to start making our own.  Having no local meadmakers to draw from, this gave us the luxury of being unafraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients not associated with meads.  Some experiments failed and others worked great, all had a powerful influence on how we saw mead and what we thought mead could be.\r\nLike any hobby we dove face first into meadmaking.  Our goal was simple, to create memorable experiences through mead using locally produced ingredients to the extent possible.  Soon we were sharing those meads with friends and they shared them with others. I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

A specially designed JV Northwest brewing system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since 2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. Mr. Karm has been a brewer of specialty beers since 1994, a life-long Akron, Ohio resident, and is a graduate of the University Of Akron.","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:14:50","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LI59Z10OUH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"UnpaXM","name":"The Tasting Room at Hoppin' Frog","streetAddress":"1680-F East Waterloo Rd.","locality":"Akron","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44306","phone":"234-525-3764","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","latitude":41.0245928,"longitude":-81.4677107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-08-18 14:10:32","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"63tq0A","name":"Mean Monkey","nameDisplay":"Mean Monkey","description":"Our flagship beer, Mean Monkey Hefeweizen (Weissbier) is a pale and refreshing wheat-based ale that features a unique banana and clove yeast character.

Competition organizers may wish to subcategorize this style into rice and corn subcategories.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:40:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"Eb2gXK","name":"Mean Doses","nameShortDisplay":"Mean Doses","description":"Fresh mean creations from the brewery sold in any dose you like from the fillery, along with guest taps, bottled beers and other stuff, all for takeaway.","website":"http:\/\/www.meandoses.co.nz","established":"2018","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Eb2gXK\/upload_prT11Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Eb2gXK\/upload_prT11Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Eb2gXK\/upload_prT11Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Eb2gXK\/upload_prT11Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Eb2gXK\/upload_prT11Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-25 15:40:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8t2AJg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"130 Tory Street","locality":"Te Aro","region":"Wellington","postalCode":"6011","phone":"64-4-213-9561","website":"www.meandoses.co.nz","latitude":-41.2967146,"longitude":174.7791522,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-25 15:43:06","updateDate":"2018-07-25 15:44:04","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-12:00pm-7:00pm,thu-12:00pm-7:00pm,fri-12:00pm-8:00pm,sat-11:00am-8:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
