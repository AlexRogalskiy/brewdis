Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy.

alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley. Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"MZZWAT","name":"Evil Twin Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Evil Twin","description":"We Have all good intentions to disturb, disorder and enlighten you with unforgettable beer after beer.\r\n\r\nBecause We are so much in love with good taste, all the beers from Evil Twin are prepared in 10 of the best breweries around the world.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA. We are servicing several local restaurants, pubs and distributers.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N39Q0L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2004 Capitol Avenue","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95814","phone":"916-448-7032","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","latitude":38.573116,"longitude":-121.480958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1987","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XmviY6","name":"Monkey Knife Fight","nameDisplay":"Monkey Knife Fight","description":"A tropical lager brewed with fresh lemongrass and ginger to produce a truly unique taste experience.
