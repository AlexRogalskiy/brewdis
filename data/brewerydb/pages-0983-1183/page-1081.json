Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"jmGoBA","name":"Flying Dog Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Flying Dog","description":"The Flying Dog Legend begins in 1983, and like every good legend there are several versions of this tale. The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:22:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5NJLHA2D94","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"o9SAiJ","name":"Naughty & Spiced","nameDisplay":"Naughty & Spiced","abv":"6.5","ibu":"30","srmId":37,"availableId":4,"styleId":19,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/o9SAiJ\/upload_M0vrLL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/o9SAiJ\/upload_M0vrLL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/o9SAiJ\/upload_M0vrLL-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/o9SAiJ\/upload_M0vrLL-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/o9SAiJ\/upload_M0vrLL-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/o9SAiJ\/upload_M0vrLL-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-12 03:34:30","updateDate":"2018-07-06 16:29:14","srm":{"id":37,"name":"37","hex":"3F0708"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":19,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Robust Porter","shortName":"Robust Porter","description":"Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.

In 2005, 14,000 gallons of beer was produced by the brewery, and with the new additions, the planned output for 2007 is double the 2005 amount.","website":"http:\/\/www.newalbanian.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2019-06-28 19:44:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ALN8FS65ZI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"253IOJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3312 Plaza Drive","locality":"New Albany","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47150","phone":"812-949-2804","website":"http:\/\/www.newalbanian.com\/","latitude":38.32809,"longitude":-85.817146,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ENDJ7o","name":"Bank Street Brewhouse","streetAddress":"415 Bank Street","locality":"New Albany","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47150","phone":"(812) 944-2577","latitude":38.286812,"longitude":-85.8225779,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-22 14:26:43","updateDate":"2015-11-19 19:24:45","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:00am-9:00pm,wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-10:00am-9:00pm,sun-10:00am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CagpF3","name":"Naughty Coco Joy","nameDisplay":"Naughty Coco Joy","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-21 18:19:28","updateDate":"2016-11-21 18:19:28","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

There we happened upon a freaky little friar named Fritz. While we were being cared after, Fritz told us his life story, being abandoned by his mother(a magical Pixie) and his father( a wayward Trappist Monk name La Salle who left the ministry and beer making to become an explorer). He was orphaned and left at the monastery to be raised by monks. The years pass by and Fritz learned the art of making \ufb01ne Belgium beers. And, as is the tradition with monks, Fritz loved sharing his incredible beers with us, the needy.\r\n\r\nOne night while drinking quite heavily, Fritz con\ufb01ded to us that his passion for beer and his lack of discipline would always keep him from rising in the ranks at the church, and that his naughty nature would keep him from ever being Head Brewmaster at the monastery. So the four of us decided to open a Brewery back in America and that we would call it the, \" Naughty Monk Brewery\". We brought Fritz with us, and we keep him hidden in the brewery, and here he brews beer, creates recipes, stalks the female employees and loves to play practical jokes on everyone.

Three of us had sustained minor injuries from the hard landing and required some medical attention. We were helped by some local villagers to a small monastery about a mile from where we landed. There we happened upon a freaky little friar named Fritz. While we were being cared after, Fritz told us his life story, being abandoned by his mother(a magical Pixie) and his father( a wayward Trappist Monk name La Salle who left the ministry and beer making to become an explorer). He was orphaned and left at the monastery to be raised by monks. The years pass by and Fritz learned the art of making \ufb01ne Belgium beers. And, as is the tradition with monks, Fritz loved sharing his incredible beers with us, the needy.\r\n\r\nOne night while drinking quite heavily, Fritz con\ufb01ded to us that his passion for beer and his lack of discipline would always keep him from rising in the ranks at the church, and that his naughty nature would keep him from ever being Head Brewmaster at the monastery. So the four of us decided to open a Brewery back in America and that we would call it the, \" Naughty Monk Brewery\". We brought Fritz with us, and we keep him hidden in the brewery, and here he brews beer, creates recipes, stalks the female employees and loves to play practical jokes on everyone. So keep a close eye out!
