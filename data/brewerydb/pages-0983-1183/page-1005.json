There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"hE6715","name":"Kings County Brewers Collective","nameShortDisplay":"Kings County Brewers Collective","description":"15 bbl brewery + taproom located in Bushwick in Brooklyn, NY.","website":"http:\/\/kcbcbeer.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hE6715\/upload_Co4sdH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hE6715\/upload_Co4sdH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hE6715\/upload_Co4sdH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hE6715\/upload_Co4sdH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hE6715\/upload_Co4sdH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-26 15:28:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:39:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5NBSO3JHU1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"XrwXvd","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"381 Troutman St.","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11237","latitude":40.70607,"longitude":-73.9237092,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-26 20:41:36","updateDate":"2017-07-26 20:41:36","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"A6dF0v","name":"Marble Tulip Juicy Gruit","nameDisplay":"Marble Tulip Juicy Gruit","abv":"5.5","styleId":15,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-28 22:24:16","updateDate":"2014-06-30 12:35:31","style":{"id":15,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scotch Ale","shortName":"Scotch Ale","description":"Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.

So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"pkULtG","name":"GrassLands Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"GrassLands","description":"GrassLands Brewing Company is a Tallahassee, FL based craft brewery with goals to educate patrons about craft beer and create awareness of issues pertinent to the craft beer industry, as well as the environment, animal welfare, conservation and sustainability.","website":"http:\/\/www.grasslandsbrewery.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pkULtG\/upload_p2kAlG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pkULtG\/upload_p2kAlG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pkULtG\/upload_p2kAlG-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pkULtG\/upload_p2kAlG-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pkULtG\/upload_p2kAlG-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-28 16:34:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:35:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HGM5QFXCIE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Zz9Erp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"603 W Gaines St","extendedAddress":"#7","locality":"Tallahassee","region":"Florida","postalCode":"32304","phone":"(850) 765-3014","website":"http:\/\/www.grasslandsbrewery.com","latitude":30.4350539,"longitude":-84.2906861,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-28 20:14:26","updateDate":"2016-06-28 20:14:26","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"4:30pm","endTime":"11:30pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:30pm","endTime":"11:30pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:30pm","endTime":"11:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:30pm","endTime":"12:30am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:30pm","endTime":"12:30am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"1:30pm","endTime":"8:30pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-4:30pm-11:30pm,wed-4:30pm-11:30pm,thu-4:30pm-11:30pm,fri-4:30pm-12:30am,sat-12:30pm-12:30am,sun-1:30pm-8:30pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FJs2ME","name":"Margot","nameDisplay":"Margot","description":"A sour blonde Ale","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FJs2ME\/upload_X7dDsm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FJs2ME\/upload_X7dDsm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FJs2ME\/upload_X7dDsm-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FJs2ME\/upload_X7dDsm-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FJs2ME\/upload_X7dDsm-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FJs2ME\/upload_X7dDsm-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 22:44:09","updateDate":"2015-12-17 11:47:45","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
