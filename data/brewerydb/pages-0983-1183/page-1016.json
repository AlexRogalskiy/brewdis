Ebony in color with a rich creamy head, the beer features a mellow flavor of oats, chocolate malt and real chocolate, perfectly balanced with the right amount of hops for a bittersweet finish. Featuring an approachable 35 IBUs and 5.3 percent ABV, it pairs well with almost any dessert, and of course, tastes delicious just on its own.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"35","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/deSp5U\/upload_GG1eGh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/deSp5U\/upload_GG1eGh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/deSp5U\/upload_GG1eGh-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/deSp5U\/upload_GG1eGh-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/deSp5U\/upload_GG1eGh-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/deSp5U\/upload_GG1eGh-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-28 17:17:53","updateDate":"2015-12-17 09:49:22","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
