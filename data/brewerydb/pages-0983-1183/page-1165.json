Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"QS1jCV","name":"Wildwood Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Wildwood","description":"Wildwood Brewery is a organic craft brewery in Western Montana committed to building an integrated brewing\/farming system where all wastes are used as value-added input.","website":"http:\/\/wildwoodbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-10 11:53:50","updateDate":"2018-11-09 19:06:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6GB3P9YFCQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"okwu8a","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4018 US Hwy 93 North","locality":"Stevensville","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59870","phone":"(406) 777-2855","website":"http:\/\/wildwoodbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm","latitude":46.53121,"longitude":-114.110864,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-10 11:54:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sun: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3j2A7f","name":"Organic Wild Mint Mojito","nameDisplay":"Organic Wild Mint Mojito","description":"18 month sour beer with added Mexican Lime juice and locally picked wild Corn Mint.","abv":"5","ibu":"10","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-13 19:25:27","updateDate":"2018-12-13 19:25:27","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

We all love craft beer, good wine and great food \u2013 especially from local producers. Hard cider began popping up in the craft beer cases around town. Local hard cider production in North Carolina and across the country was starting to take off. So we asked ourselves \u2013 why not Atlanta? Our home city has a vibrant farm-to-table restaurant scene, and more than 60 farmers markets. North Georgia has robust apple production. Craft cocktails, small-scale craft breweries and local restaurants dominate growth in the city. We would jump on the chance to taste a locally made hard cider, so why didn\u2019t we make it ourselves?\r\nSo it began. We carefully considered where in Atlanta to base our business, and ended up just where some of our partners grew up \u2013 Marietta. We leveraged years of home-based cider making, and started figuring out how to make the best cider \u2013 clean, refreshing and pleasantly sweet, while avoiding the cloying taste and heavy back-sweetening found in most national brands.\r\nTreehorn Cider is available in restaurants, bars and growler shops throughout Georgia. We love talking and thinking about cider, and above all making cider that you can drink with any meal, any time. It\u2019s become our passion, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunity to share it with you!","website":"http:\/\/www.treehorncider.com\/","mailingListUrl":"info@treehorncider.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 15:23:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"4L4XMU","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"1395 S Marietta Pkwy SE, Bldg 100, Ste 130","locality":"Marietta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30067","phone":"+1 678-717-8434","website":"http:\/\/www.treehorncider.com","latitude":33.941684,"longitude":-84.5124605,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 15:28:24","updateDate":"2016-02-17 15:28:24","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pv8uBd","name":"Origin","nameDisplay":"Origin","abv":"6.5","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-29 13:57:35","updateDate":"2017-06-29 13:57:35","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"hgjj29","name":"Shmaltz Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Shmaltz","description":"Shmaltz Brewing Company is an American craft brewing company that brews He'brew Beer.

At first the only thing we had in common was the desire to build something to be proud of, something that made the world a better, more engaging place. Jason\u2019s passion for cider is what brought us together. And the world is obviously a better place with good cider.\r\n\r\nJason, like other members of the team, fell in love with cider during his time spent studying abroad in London. He returned to the States and found himself let down with the selection available. Armed with some family cider making history from English cider country, Jason audaciously convinced our professor to let him start an alcohol company and pitch it to the class. We all were crazy enough to join him and have been trying to mange his risk taking and big ideas ever since.\r\n\r\nWe started out in our basement, experimenting first with store bought juice then with juice from across Minnesota and from across the country. After many obstacles, emergency meetings, late nights, bad batches, lessons from mentors and fun nights of \u201cresearch\u201d, we had a cider that we loved and a plan to bring it to market.\r\n\r\nLionheart was born from a opportunity to turn our passion from a class project into a business and we ran with it. In the spring of 2015 we partnered with a Jester and Judge Cider Company of Stevenson, Washington to produce our first commercial batch. Four-packs Lionheart Original hit store shelves on July 14th, 2015. We\u2019re now starting to work towards building a cidery and taproom here in the Twin Cities; Lionheart is Minnesota born and we can\u2019t wait for it to be Minnesota made.\r\n\r\nLionheart by definition means courageous. We believe it takes a lionhearted person to make their way throughout the world, figure out who they want to be, and what kind of mark they want to leave on this place. We hope that Lionheart encourages people to do just that, to get out of their everyday, meet new people, try new things and share different experiences, all with a great cider in hand.\r\n\r\nWe believe that great craft cider is like great craft beer: made by real people who use hard work and creativity to make products they love.","website":"http:\/\/www.lionheartcider.com\/","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"info@lionheartcider.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b2VgxZ\/upload_5f4p0r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b2VgxZ\/upload_5f4p0r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b2VgxZ\/upload_5f4p0r-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b2VgxZ\/upload_5f4p0r-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b2VgxZ\/upload_5f4p0r-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-01 15:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NPZ5un","name":"Main Cidery","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"Minnesota","latitude":44.977753,"longitude":-93.2650108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-01 15:44:04","updateDate":"2016-09-01 15:44:04","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xaf8YW","name":"Original","nameDisplay":"Original","description":"Inspired by our family's 1867 recipe, Leinenkugel's Original is brewed with Pale malts and Cluster hops.

While on a ski trip with with friends and winding the evening down in a local brewpub, our founder had the glimmer of an idea that would take root and come to fruition nearly three years later.\r\n\r\nFreetail Original represents the culmination of that dream into liquid reality. It harkens back to those first days in 2008 when our vision for what Freetail would be was still forming--the bricks and mortar were set, but the steam in the kettle was still rising.\r\n\r\nA big, malty American Amber led the way as our flagship beer--with a crisp, bitter hop character to balance. By design, Freetail Ale has gone through many changes at the pub, but as one of our inaugural releases at our S. Presa brewery we wanted to pay homage to the Original. Brewed with Pils, Munich, Vienna and Caramunich malts hand in hand with European and American hops, this tribute to fulfilling a dream piques our enthusiasm for another new beginning.","abv":"6.3","ibu":"40","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-25 14:47:41","updateDate":"2016-04-25 14:47:41","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Established in 2003, its beer has gone on to be the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular in Sweden. It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"e9z9co","name":"Original","nameDisplay":"Original","abv":"5.2","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:53","updateDate":"2014-12-29 12:29:26","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.
