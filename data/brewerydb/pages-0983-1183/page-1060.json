You  can hear two things happen at Noon: the Noon Whistle and the  opening of a fresh beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.noonwhistlebrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-24 15:11:25","updateDate":"2019-06-18 18:14:50","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PQSKYM9A3N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S4gwnP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"800 E Roosevelt Rd","locality":"Lombard","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60148","website":"http:\/\/www.noonwhistlebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm","latitude":41.8621611,"longitude":-88.0006379,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-24 15:11:25","updateDate":"2017-08-22 17:20:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2Nn4kI","name":"Mosaic Harvest","nameDisplay":"Mosaic Harvest","abv":"5.5","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 19:34:33","updateDate":"2018-06-12 13:32:56","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few.

And whilst Wes has been a fan of Dave's beer for years, he brings bag loads of enthusiasm and management experience to the table. The third member of the team, Ben Galanos, has worked in various sales and hospitality roles for nearly 20 years and is an unapologetic craft beer fan.  \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the Akasha team is made up of like-minded, passionate beer enthusiasts. Our culture is pretty simple: brew the beer that we love to drink and, most importantly, have some fun while we\u2019re doing it. Basically, for all of us here at Akasha, beer is our way of life.\r\n\r\nThe word 'Akasha' refers to the 'fifth' element. The 'unknown factor' that combines the four elements of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. And we bring this concept to the craft of brewing beer. Whilst most beer is made from the four basic ingredients of malt, hops, water, and yeast, it is this 'fifth' element, the Akasha, that instils the spirit, the soul and the magic, to create a beer that is truly special. Something that we can be proud of.","website":"http:\/\/www.akashabrewing.com.au","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tTARNt\/upload_cPfxlP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tTARNt\/upload_cPfxlP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tTARNt\/upload_cPfxlP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tTARNt\/upload_cPfxlP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tTARNt\/upload_cPfxlP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-18 04:35:51","updateDate":"2019-08-14 16:11:38","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vSUs6u","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10A Spencer Street","locality":"Five Dock","region":"New South Wales","postalCode":"2046","phone":"+61 2 9715 7156","website":"http:\/\/www.akashabrewing.com.au","latitude":-33.8696201,"longitude":151.1182199,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-25 14:06:36","updateDate":"2016-08-25 14:06:36","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-2:00pm-7:00pm,sat-2:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"Australia\/Sydney","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XkWmmY","name":"Mosaic IPA","nameDisplay":"Mosaic IPA","abv":"6","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","beerVariationId":"GefuM7","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XkWmmY\/upload_WrviHe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XkWmmY\/upload_WrviHe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XkWmmY\/upload_WrviHe-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XkWmmY\/upload_WrviHe-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XkWmmY\/upload_WrviHe-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XkWmmY\/upload_WrviHe-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-22 14:17:14","updateDate":"2015-12-17 09:16:47","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

It also included permission for us to use the ArtPrize identity marks (logo and graphics) on any co-packaged items, including beer. We plan to release a new beer for each year of our five-year partnership with ArtPrize under the name \u201cArtist Series\u201d. This is year two.

ArtPrize is an international art competition, open to any artist and decided by public vote. Its mission is to promote critical dialogue and collaboration through new, creative ideas among a large and diverse population of people. As an innovator in redefining what beer can be, we believe that experimentation is central to the human experience\u2014whether one experiments with grains and hops or colored glass and light\u2014and that sharing one\u2019s creation with the public is a brave act worth celebrating.\r\n\r\n\u201cFounders is an iconic brand producing a sublime range of exquisite beers in our own Grand Rapids,\u201d said Christian Gaines, executive director of ArtPrize. \u201cWe\u2019re honored and elated to count Founders as the ArtPrize Official Brewery and to include Mosaic Promise as the latest special release beer\u2014one that\u2019s emblematic of our strong partnership and shared commitment to art, artists and community.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore than 400,000 people are expected to attend ArtPrize 2014.\r\n\r\nWe also partnered with ArtPrize to launch ArtPrize on Tap, the newest ArtClub membership perk. From the patios of the Centennial Room, our private second-floor entertainment space, ArtPrize on Tap offers ArtClub members the opportunity to connect year-round and stay on the ArtPrize insider track, while enjoying Founders food and beer. We will premiere Mosaic Promise at the August installment of ArtPrize on Tap. Held on the third Wednesday of every month, ArtPrize on Tap is free for ArtClub members, and friends of ArtPrize and Founders can join for $10. To learn more, go to artprize.org\/artclub.\r\n\r\nMosaic Promise will be available for a limited time starting on Sunday, September 14, across our Michigan, Wisconsin, metro NYC and Chicagoland distribution footprint. It will be released in our taproom on draft and in bottles starting on Tuesday, September 16. There will be an event in our taproom featuring the artists and introducing the beer from 4:30-6:30pm that day. One-of-a-kind Mosaic Promise posters will be given away, while supplies last. Mosaic Promise will also be featured at official ArtPrize events.\r\n\r\nThis year marks the sixth edition of ArtPrize, which will take place Sept. 24\u2013Oct. 12, 2014. Our taproom will be a venue for the sixth year running.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"50","srmId":9,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-19 01:48:00","updateDate":"2016-04-14 17:16:19","srm":{"id":9,"name":"9","hex":"E58500"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
