Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"8xokAA","name":"Orf Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Orf","description":"Orf Brewing crafts creative hybrid ales made in small batches (1-8 barrels) mixing traditional elements from diverse origins into truly American beers with exceptional flavors, distinct aromas, and an air of festiveness.","website":"http:\/\/www.orfbrewing.com","established":"2017","mailingListUrl":"www.orfbrewing.com\/contact","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8xokAA\/upload_fvuYrM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8xokAA\/upload_fvuYrM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8xokAA\/upload_fvuYrM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8xokAA\/upload_fvuYrM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8xokAA\/upload_fvuYrM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:23:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KX1U6OCYEZ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"PZOy9a","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Austin","region":"Texas","latitude":30.267605,"longitude":-97.742984,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2YIWG4","name":"OOFA-OOFA","nameDisplay":"OOFA-OOFA","description":"Chocolate, coffee and roast flavors.","abv":"8","availableId":1,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-03 11:42:30","updateDate":"2017-10-03 13:05:34","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

That insight, along with an enduring passion for the craft of beer making, led us to create the Barebottle, a San Francisco crowd-inspired craft brewery.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy and process is pretty simple:\r\n1) Use the things that inspire us every day from the SF\/Bay Area as the foundation for each new beer we make.\r\n\r\n2) Inspire our merry band of super-talented homebrewing experts (which includes our head brewer, the founders, and some of the bay area\u2019s best homebrewers) to create new beers.\r\n\r\n3) Just like in regular competitions, we pilot-brew a select group of the best finalist beers and ask visitors to the brewery to cast their vote for their favorite beer. May the best beer always win.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this approach will lead to some incredible beers, and we hope you are eager to help us try some of them.- Ben, Lester, and Mike","website":"http:\/\/www.barebottlebeer.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"lesterkoga@gmail.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:42","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"O9ERXQA0BL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"44rVs2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1525 Cortland Ave","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94110","website":"http:\/\/www.barebottle.com","latitude":37.7401129,"longitude":-122.409035,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2017-09-20 12:55:53","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sGNwNm","name":"Oops!

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"c1ade9","name":"Ellicottville Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Ellicottville","description":"To date, EBC is considered one of the finest craft brewers and has received no less than THREE International World Beer Championship Awards.\r\n\r\nThe Ellicottville Brewing Company is the result of the desire to open a family business.

The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.

American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"TI53eD","name":"Choc Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Choc","description":"Meet Oklahoma's oldest handcrafted beer.\r\n\r\nIn Italian immigrant Pete Prichard's effort to support his family, he came up with the idea of using an Indian Territory recipe to brew a beverage for the coal miners.\r\n\r\nPete's idea led to trouble during Prohibition. He was convicted, not once but twice, for breaking the federal Prohibition Act.\r\n\r\nProhibition was repealed in the late 1950s, but home brewed beverages were still illegal because they didn't bear the proper liquor stamps. Nevertheless, homemade Choc and wine continued to be available to regular customers at Pete's, a restaurant owned by Prichard in Krebs, Okla.\r\n\r\nThose customers happen to include JFK and high-powered Oklahoma politicians.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1995, through tireless efforts on the part of Joe Prichard, the grandson of the founder, Pete's Place reintroduced Choc beer as part of the restaurant's tradition and a \"legal\" brew for customers.","website":"http:\/\/www.chocbeer.com\/","established":"1919","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TI53eD\/upload_jrRzD1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TI53eD\/upload_jrRzD1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TI53eD\/upload_jrRzD1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TI53eD\/upload_jrRzD1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TI53eD\/upload_jrRzD1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:32","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"X1QD84MBOS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cAeitn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"120 Sw 8th St","locality":"Krebs","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74554","phone":"918-423-2042","website":"http:\/\/www.chocbeer.com\/","latitude":34.92723,"longitude":-95.725309,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1919","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"e6N78B","name":"Opa's Oktoberfest","nameDisplay":"Opa's Oktoberfest","abv":"5.2","glasswareId":3,"availableId":4,"styleId":102,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e6N78B\/upload_0NanlK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e6N78B\/upload_0NanlK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e6N78B\/upload_0NanlK-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e6N78B\/upload_0NanlK-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e6N78B\/upload_0NanlK-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e6N78B\/upload_0NanlK-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-09 10:45:19","updateDate":"2015-12-17 13:40:01","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":102,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style M\u00e4rzen \/ Oktoberfest","shortName":"American Oktoberfest","description":"The American style of these classic German beers is distinguished by a comparatively greater degree of hop character.

He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors.

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:13:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"UYOVWAHCBD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RW6Da0","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Laurel","region":"MD","postalCode":"20723","latitude":39.1426709,"longitude":-76.860565,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-03-14 17:43:05","updateDate":"2016-05-01 14:34:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
