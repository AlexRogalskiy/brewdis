Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"fz3g3i","name":"Pipeworks Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Pipeworks","description":"Pipeworks began, as many breweries do, in the stove top kettles and plastic-bucket fermenters of the home brewer. Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:40:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M8ICS1LEDY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wbpj5b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3912 W McLean Ave","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60647","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.9180876,"longitude":-87.7260612,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-06-16 17:16:46","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6ON5DA","name":"Nissefar","nameDisplay":"Nissefar","description":"We make x-mas beers beers with the good old traditional flavour from the days when the old farm breweries made dark, hearty, earthy beers with lots of x-masy flavours.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

We're an independent, production brewery that was established in 2013 in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois to brew beyond the confines of typical beers.  \r\n\r\nOur team combines centuries-old global brewing traditions and new American craft brewing ingenuity & artisanship to produce a wide array of beers for every palate. We brew more styles of beer because we have a passion for brewing and because you have a passion for unique, craft beers.

It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"hpK1X5","name":"O'so Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"O'so","description":"3028 Village Park Dr. Plover WI\r\n\r\nArtisan brewery specializing in barrel aged sour beers and all things incredibly hoppy","website":"http:\/\/www.osobrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:23:32","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4TGPEFX23J","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ILdv2n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3028 Village Park Drive","locality":"Plover","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54467","phone":"715-254-2163","website":"http:\/\/www.osobrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday -Saturday 9:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m.\r\nSunday 10 a.m. - 4 p.m.","latitude":44.452355,"longitude":-89.523162,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday -Saturday 9:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m.\r\nSunday 10 a.m. - 4 p.m.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Nyb2Vg","name":"Nitro Blonde","nameDisplay":"Nitro Blonde","abv":"8","ibu":"20","srmId":1,"availableId":2,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-14 03:39:00","updateDate":"2015-01-22 21:56:44","srm":{"id":1,"name":"1","hex":"FFE699"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Vb5YY1","name":"Nitro Cobbstopper","nameDisplay":"Nitro Cobbstopper","description":"Musing on our bright and frisky Peach Dodo, this nitro nocturne is suffused with a healthy dose of vanilla and lactose.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"0s8yID","name":"Rhinegeist","nameShortDisplay":"Rhinegeist","description":"Rhinegeist is a brewery out of Cincinnati, OH that was built within the skeleton of the old Moerlein bottling plant (built in 1895).

Rob and Carina Nelson started making their own wine over 5 years ago and they have been expanding ever since, including adding a microbrewery this year. All of our grapes and apples are brought in from the West side of Michigan. We then do all the pressing in the cider mill and fermenting and bottling in the winery building. Every bottle is filled and labeled by hand. The winery produces several alcoholic wines, hard cider flavors and most recently BEER! We are also adding a small distillery soon!","website":"http:\/\/www.thenorthvillewinery.com\/","mailingListUrl":"Northvillewinery@gmail.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-10 13:21:59","updateDate":"2018-12-18 19:09:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0XN8Z9C7V5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"PbIpTo","name":"Northville Winery & Brewing Company","streetAddress":"630 Baseline Road","locality":"Northville","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48167","website":"http:\/\/www.thenorthvillewinery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:\r\n6:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\r\n3:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat:\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":42.4396009,"longitude":-83.4849105,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-04 01:12:11","updateDate":"2015-08-04 15:57:09","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu:\r\n6:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\r\n3:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat:\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tHPJlo","name":"Nitro Cutthroat Porter","nameDisplay":"Nitro Cutthroat Porter","description":"Not quite a stout but definitely no lightweight, Cutthroat Porter is smooth and robust.
