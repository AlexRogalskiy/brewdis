Our Oatmeal Stout is a little shy but friendly, just like you. You two are gonna hit it off right away. Most beer is brewed entirely with barley but this one includes some oats, a closely-related cereal grain which adds a silky mouthfeel with creamy, long-lasting foam and lace. No harsh burnt notes here, we prefer bready, toasty and rich chocolate notes with a nice soft earthy note from fuggle hops. Full-bodied, warming, and smoooooooth.  Employees at the Civil Life have a long running joke with their doctors that tell them to eat oatmeal and they say, \"What? Drink my oatmeal?\"  Then they immediately end the appointment and return to \"work\".","abv":"5.7","ibu":"35","styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-02-14 00:46:53","updateDate":"2017-02-14 00:46:53","style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

We strive to bring an authentic and pleasant experience to all of our customers through our unique ales and lagers.","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","established":"1985","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ORN90Y51W8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"NnffJ2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8938 Krum Ave.","locality":"Galesburg","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49053","phone":"269-382-2338","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","latitude":42.2843486,"longitude":-85.4538497,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1985","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-25 20:15:04","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"uCUre7","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E Kalamazoo Ave","locality":"Kalamazoo","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49007","website":"http:\/\/bellsbeer.com\/eccentric-cafe\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","latitude":42.2949613,"longitude":-85.5789817,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-26 11:44:59","updateDate":"2015-05-06 15:19:37","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Y0IatW","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"O8pf7B","name":"Oatmeal Stout","nameDisplay":"Oatmeal Stout","abv":"6.5","availableId":4,"styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-29 15:20:19","updateDate":"2015-09-29 15:20:19","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

We began as a herb farm, growing culinary and medicinal herbs for the garden center trade. \r\n \r\nOur herb farm, Sunflower Cottage, grows 120,000 potted herb plants each spring from seeds and cuttings to sell to other garden centers and to our own customers. \r\n \r\nIn the fall of 2012, we built our hops field.  After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.\r\n \r\nWe host 3 annual events, The Virginia Herb Festival (June), BRB Hop Harvest Party (August) and BRB Holiday Market (November). \r\n \r\nYou are cordially invited to come and drink our beer, eat, play and spend some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.backroombreweryva.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:40:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EZKWH4V13N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"CEon99","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Ridgemont Rd.","locality":"Middletown","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22645","phone":"540-869-8482","latitude":38.9956004,"longitude":-78.2210269,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:28:31","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ClyA6Q","name":"Oatmeal Stout","nameDisplay":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Starts with a beige head, moving to aromas of coffee.
