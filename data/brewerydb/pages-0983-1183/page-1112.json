This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"jqYJaK","name":"Carolina Bauernhaus Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Carolina Bauernhaus","description":"Carolina Bauernhaus\u2122 is a farmhouse brewery in Anderson, SC.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"},"breweries":[{"id":"BY7YBW","name":"Other Half Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Other Half","description":"Craft Brewery specializing in IPA's and Sours","website":"http:\/\/otherhalfbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-26 11:54:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"98GVKLAQRC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Z2TDwn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Centre St","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11231","phone":"345-987-3527","website":"http:\/\/www.otherhalfbrewing.com","latitude":40.6738126,"longitude":-73.9991345,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-26 11:55:42","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:45:12","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-5:00pm-10:00pm,wed-5:00pm-10:00pm,thu-5:00pm-10:00pm,fri-5:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"mr5nrC","name":"Other Half Brewing Company: Rochester","streetAddress":"6621 State Rte 5 And 20","locality":"Bloomfield","region":"New York","phone":"(585) 617-0453","website":"https:\/\/otherhalfbrewing.com","latitude":42.8824234,"longitude":-77.3924087,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-03-14 18:09:00","updateDate":"2019-03-14 18:09:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"ttP7dP","name":"KEX Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"KEX","description":"KEX Brewing is a project driven buy a group of people with varied experience but same ambition for great beers.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Far From The Tree began fermenting apples in January 2014 and released their first cider in mid-May 2014. Although they\u2019ve only been in business a short time, the business has been brewing for years.\r\n\r\nThe Snape\u2019s met in 2007. At the time, they were both in different careers. As a hobby they experimented with wine they had made using home winemaking kits. Al jokes that he \u201ceven came up with a way of making sparkling wine using old corks and duct tape, which considering the base materials came out pretty well!\u201d Before long, the couple\u2019s passion for wine deepened and they both decided to quit their jobs to move to England.\r\n\r\nAl obtained a student visa, and enrolled in the University of Brighton, Plumpton College Bachelor of Science program in Viticulture and Oenology. The chemistry and biology-intense Plumpton College program is located in Lewes, England, and takes three years to complete. It has the distinction of being the only European winemaking degree program taught in English.\r\n\r\nDuring breaks, Al lived in different winemaking regions while learning about that area\u2019s wine and working at a winery. He worked in Germany\u2019s Mosel Valley, Bordeaux and Champagne.\r\n\r\nOver the course of their time in England, they both became more and more interested in the process of making cider. Lewes\u2019 town market had an apple press, and residents and visitors (including Al and Denise) often gathered apples from the area\u2019s abandoned apple orchards and pressed them.\r\n\r\nAl had wanted to open a winery for years. \u201cThe idea of starting our own cider house was a bit of an epiphany during my dissertation, while studying and reading paper after paper about the difficulties of growing grapes in New England, and harsh climates in general. Time and time again the best solutions were always just to grow what worked best in that area without trying to force something to grow where it just isn\u2019t meant to grow. Thus, the idea was born that we should make hard cider, not wine, in New England\u2014its ingredients are what grow well here and as New Englanders that\u2019s what makes the most sense to us. Don\u2019t try to force it. Do what works, and do it well.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith Al\u2019s degree and hands on experience, and the couple\u2019s new idea of opening a cider house, they returned to the United States. After spending time on the West Coast visiting winemaker friends and exploring the region\u2019s hard cider culture, they briefly considered moving to Washington or Oregon. A craft cider movement was underway and hard cider bars were a growing trend in both states. After their wedding in New York State\u2019s Finger Lakes region, the couple decided to settle on the East Coast. Only a day or two after they married, they began the process of launching and searching for a home for Far From The Tree. They found that home in Salem.\r\n\r\nLocated on Jackson Street, Far From The Tree operates in the unheated cellar of a building that they share with their landlord, who runs a marine construction company. The entire back section of the cellar contains an abandoned walk in freezer. Oak barrels fill the front and back sections of the room. It is, Al notes, perfect for them. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderfully designed to hold a constant temperature. The Champenoise knew digging 50 feet down into the limestone would be worth it for the same reason. Cider, much like white wine, needs to be kept under 60 degrees and maintain a very steady temperature as it ages. With the insulation provided by the abandoned walk in freezer unit we can very easily do this with little to no energy. I would not be able to make this cider in a conventional space without a massive investment in temperature control.\u201d\r\n\r\nFar From The Tree\u2019s cider bears no resemblance to large mass produced hard ciders. It is not super sweet, but rather dry and refreshing with light carbonation, and tastes deliciously of apples. That\u2019s because the first ingredient in each of the company\u2019s three current varieties is, in fact, pressed apples.\r\n\r\nMaking hard cider, Denise notes, is a natural extension of the processes that Al learned while studying in England. Far From The Tree\u2019s goal, she says, is to use these techniques to create a product of which the company can be proud. The company gets its apples October through April from orchards in central Massachusetts. The apples then go to a cider mill in Stow to be pressed. The same day, the fresh juice is brought to Far From The Tree\u2019s Salem cellar, where it is pumped into oak barrels to begin the fermentation process.\r\n\r\nFar From The Tree originally started with three varieties of its dry ciders: Roots, Rind and Sprig.  Since opening their tasting room in August 2015 the cider makers have made dozens of new ciders.  They will be releasing 4 new ciders in 2016.  We hope you enjoy them!","website":"http:\/\/www.farfromthetreecider.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wECwS4\/upload_RJJvKI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wECwS4\/upload_RJJvKI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wECwS4\/upload_RJJvKI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wECwS4\/upload_RJJvKI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wECwS4\/upload_RJJvKI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-24 14:21:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vuswuJ","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"108 Jackson Street","locality":"Salem","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01970","phone":"978-224-2904","website":"http:\/\/www.farfromthetreecider.com\/","latitude":42.514745,"longitude":-70.899891,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-24 14:25:56","updateDate":"2016-04-24 14:25:56","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
