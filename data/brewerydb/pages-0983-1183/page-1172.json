It is one of the last remaining authentic lambic breweries of Belgium and well known for its lambic beer brewed along traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nLambic matures up to three years in wooden barrels, whereupon it is blended to make Oude Geuze. Sour cherries undergo fermentation in lambic beer and after a second fermentation in the bottle Oude Kriek is born. This unique brewing process with spontaneous fermentation is possible in Belgium in the Pajottenland region, the Zenne Valley and in Brussels, because of the presence of a specific microflora.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of succession in the family business at the end of 2002, the traditional lambic beers of Oud Beersel were threatened to disappear. Shocked by the loss of this cultural and historical patrimony, the brewery was taken over in 2005 and business was restarted pursuing the principal aim to protect the time-honoured lambic beers, as well as the cultural and historical heritage of Oud Beersel for the coming generations.\r\n\r\nThis traditional brewery of lambic beers is nowadays managed in a modern way with respect for tradition and the m\u00e9tier. The traditional part of the production process of the lambic beers, in particular the spontaneous fermentation, the maturation of lambic in wooden barrels and the mixture of various lambic casks and vintages constitutes the core business of the company. The production process is completed in close collaboration with excellent partners who manage the industrial equipment. By the synergy between the m\u00e9tier and the industry, Oud Beersel offers authentic products of the highest quality.\r\n\r\nThanks to the success of the special Bersalis beers, i.e. the high fermentation beers of Oud Beersel, investments are continuously made to optimize the production process, to achieve the most demanding quality standards and to extend the infrastructure for the time-honoured lambic beers of Oud Beersel in order to meet the always growing demand.","website":"http:\/\/www.oudbeersel.com\/","established":"1882","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"6xIUOg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Laarheiestraat 230","locality":"Beersel","region":"Vlaams Brabant","latitude":50.7599724,"longitude":4.3047963,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2Bu82E","name":"Oude Lambik","nameDisplay":"Oude Lambik","description":"lease note the age of the sample you are reviewing when entering your rating.

Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"PGn0ta","name":"Bruery Terreux","nameShortDisplay":"Bruery Terreux","description":"Wildly Traditional Bi\u00e8re.\r\n\r\nThe Bruery is excited to announce the formation of Bruery Terreux, a new brand that will focus solely on farmhouse-style ales fermented with wild yeasts as well as oak-aged sour ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.brueryterreux.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-10 22:14:17","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"nGOCHu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"717 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-829-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.brueryterreux.com","latitude":33.8623421,"longitude":-117.879254,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-11 20:06:23","updateDate":"2015-08-31 16:40:16","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"byPoX0","name":"Oude Tart with Boysenberries","nameDisplay":"Oude Tart with Boysenberries","description":"Flemish-style red ale aged in oak barrels with boysenberries","abv":"8.3","styleId":57,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-21 06:30:06","updateDate":"2016-05-01 15:45:53","style":{"id":57,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Flanders Oud Bruin or Oud Red Ales","shortName":"Flanders Red","description":"This light- to medium-bodied deep copper to brown ale is characterized by a slight to strong lactic sourness, and with \"Reds\" sometimes a balanced degree of acetic acid.

We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PD1LOINQV7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zWsbEE","name":"Ouisconsing Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Ouisconsing Red Ale","description":"This smooth amber ale with its mellow nutty flavor and subtle flowery nose is a hit with even the newest of speciality beer drinkers.

Three years into our project and we\u2019re grateful and amazed that so many people love and support great beer these days.  The fact that we\u2019re still here is a credit to you all.\r\n\r\nBut for the question of primary importance: What is the beer? Well, it\u2019s our Pretty Things barleywine.  Inspired by malted barley, a tribute to the barleycorn.  Yes, it\u2019s simple, but that\u2019s what barleywines are all about.  Ever since brewing in England, Dann has dreamed of making a barley-focused beer using the malts of Yorkshire (and never hesitates to plug his favorite: Thomas Fawcett & Sons).  The American version of a barleywine is normally a sad beer indeed, lots of hops and alcohol but the star of the show is left scratching his chin in the eaves of the theatre.  This is not one of those beers.  The English invented this style and they\u2019re the only ones who know how to make one, save the rare American brewer.\r\n\r\nGive barley a chance and this mysterious little grain can do grand things!\r\n\r\nTo get the density of sugars needed for this sort of beer, we employed \u201cdouble mashing\u201d. The brewhouse that we work on can only get to maybe 18 plato for a single running of wort: but we wanted 27 plato! So we combined two brews by running wort into the kettle and then using it to mash in the second batch. We don\u2019t take credit for this idea.  We\u2019re certain it has been done many, many times before.  But it wasn\u2019t until Will Meyers (the great Cantabridgian Cervecero) brought this method to our attention that we realized we could brew a barleywine of proper gravity\u2026 (he never told us that he hadn\u2019t actually performed this sort of brewing before!). Anyway, it works!!\r\n\r\nExpect an aroma of juicy sultanas, wet wood, green apple, malted milk balls, marzipan and alcohol deliciousness. It\u2019s got a medium body and is a little more spritsy than we\u2019re sure the Brits would like. Serve over 50 degrees fahrenheit in a stemmed glass.\r\n\r\nVery suitable to drink this year or next, or even the winter after that!","abv":"11","glasswareId":10,"availableId":4,"styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LMPeqi\/upload_XsosKI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LMPeqi\/upload_XsosKI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LMPeqi\/upload_XsosKI-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LMPeqi\/upload_XsosKI-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LMPeqi\/upload_XsosKI-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LMPeqi\/upload_XsosKI-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.116","createDate":"2012-04-23 19:25:19","updateDate":"2017-01-10 21:35:04","glass":{"id":10,"name":"Oversized Wine Glass","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

Together with an amazing team, these guys are dedicated to bringing you joy in a form of craft beer.","website":"https:\/\/www.soribrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fEHtXM\/upload_dbxeAc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fEHtXM\/upload_dbxeAc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fEHtXM\/upload_dbxeAc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fEHtXM\/upload_dbxeAc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fEHtXM\/upload_dbxeAc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-03 08:09:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"xCYZAH","name":"Headquarters","streetAddress":"Suur-S\u00f5jam\u00e4e 14","locality":"Tallinn","website":"https:\/\/soribrewing.com\/","latitude":59.4219842,"longitude":24.8117451,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"EE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-03 08:09:11","updateDate":"2018-08-16 18:25:26","country":{"isoCode":"EE","name":"ESTONIA","displayName":"Estonia","isoThree":"EST","numberCode":233,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MXrL04","name":"Out of Order IPA","nameDisplay":"Out of Order IPA","description":"IPA","abv":"5","ibu":"54","srmId":7,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 14:35:50","updateDate":"2014-10-07 14:35:50","srm":{"id":7,"name":"7","hex":"F39C00"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
