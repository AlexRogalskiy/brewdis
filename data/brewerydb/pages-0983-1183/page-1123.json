After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved.

The historical significance paired with the duo\u2019s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nKnowing that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it all on their own, Jason and Brian called upon former co-worker and professional brewer Jonathan Lee to help run the tasting room and work in the brewery.  Jonathan\u2019s experience as a craft beer bar manager, combined with his professional brewing experience made him the perfect fit.","website":"http:\/\/www.cannonballcreekbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UWtF4X\/upload_1wAzkd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UWtF4X\/upload_1wAzkd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UWtF4X\/upload_1wAzkd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UWtF4X\/upload_1wAzkd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UWtF4X\/upload_1wAzkd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:09:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:17:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"L3I52R6PKN","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CFIZtr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"393 N.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"sYdp0k","name":"River Horse Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"River Horse","description":"You don't have to be in a dead end job to feel like you aren't going anywhere.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"q0T7qf","name":"Chapel Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Chapel","description":"15 Hester St\r\nDundas, MN 55019\r\nPhone:\r\n507-664-1300","website":"http:\/\/chapelbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q0T7qf\/upload_gbocwd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q0T7qf\/upload_gbocwd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q0T7qf\/upload_gbocwd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q0T7qf\/upload_gbocwd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q0T7qf\/upload_gbocwd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-21 15:17:48","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:29:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"C9WZIKR5YT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"KTmtnn","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"15 Hester St","locality":"Dundas","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55019","phone":"507-664-1300","website":"http:\/\/chapelbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.429691,"longitude":-93.203863,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-23 15:54:39","updateDate":"2018-04-10 14:12:25","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bGwgDm","name":"Oatmeal Stout","nameDisplay":"Oatmeal Stout","abv":"5.4","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-10-10 21:02:31","updateDate":"2019-10-10 21:02:31","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
