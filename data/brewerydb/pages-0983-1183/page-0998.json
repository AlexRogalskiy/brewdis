Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.058","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"JGQ4db","name":"JW Lees and Co (Brewers) Ltd.","nameShortDisplay":"JW Lees and Co (Brewers) Ltd.","website":"https:\/\/www.jwlees.co.uk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"x4Dnt0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Middleton Junction","locality":"Manchester","region":"Manchester","phone":"44-(0161)-6432487","latitude":53.479605,"longitude":-2.248818,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JHUBYO","name":"Mancuerda","nameDisplay":"Mancuerda","description":"Giovanni II Bentivoglio, the tyrant who ruled Bologna with a tight grip, sentenced Luca Gaurico to the torture of Mancuerda in 1504.  The Italian Astronomer, Astrologer and Mathematician, was known for his scientific contributions and famously prophesied alongside Nostradamus.  When Giovanni consulted the astrologist about about he and his sons destinies, displeasure was an understatement.  Luca was subjected to the torture (which he survived) and exiled from Bologna.\r\nTight cords were wound around the limbs (usually arms) while the condemned was belted\/secured to a stationary structure. The executioner would exert his weight opposite his victim or use leverage to pull the cords against themselves, the tightening eventually cutting through the skin, muscles and directly to the bone.  Repeating until the stretching of limbs and cord slicing caused the victim to faint or expire.\r\nA foundation of Eraclea Pilsner grown just 160km (100 miles) from the site of the bloodshed, provides a sticky sweet mouthfeel with hints of honey and aromatic lacing.  Double dry hopped with Comet, Galaxy and Polaris as tribute to Luca Gaurico.  While the Bentovoglio Family Crest emblazons the floor on the label.\r\nSoft sweet pineapple mint, fresh cut onion grass and mandarin zest aromatics.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Mandarina Bavaria is a cross pollination of Cascade and German Hallertau hops. Flavors of this hop are best described as sweet tangerine, almost similar to orange-flavored hard candy. This hop is noticeably less aromatic than most American or Southern Hemisphere cross-breeds. For comparison, this beer was made with exactly the same amount of hops as the previous beer in the series, Simcoe. As far as the beer's style, we're using a more traditional single-hop process for these new German hops. Since they are brand new, the malt bill will be exactly the same for this beer and the next two (Hull Melon and Hallertau Blanc) to allow people to taste the difference between the hops. The style will be American Pale Ale, 6% ABV, 45 IBUs, and brewed with two row barley, vienna malt, munich malt, and flaked barley.","abv":"6","ibu":"45","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-06 11:59:51","updateDate":"2014-06-06 11:59:51","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
