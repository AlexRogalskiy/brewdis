Fast friends and freshman roommates, they came up together during their years at UNH.  After graduation each wished the other well and split for separate coasts. Dane crossed the country, landing in San Francisco, where a hobby born from homebrewing with his father compelled him to volunteer at Magnolia Gastropub & Brewery in the Bay Area's famed Haight-Ashbury. It was at Magnolia that Dane first got drunk on beer. Well, wait, not intoxicated drunk, though, obviously one can assume, but drunk as in impassioned. He became impassioned to turn a hobby into a life\u2019s discipline. In the years to follow, Dane would become a brewer at the international brewery Trumer, lead brewer at Magnolia, and in 2015, upon returning to the Seacoast, brewer at Smuttynose.\r\n\r\nDuring that time Dagan spent his days laying roots in Portsmouth. Although, he\u2019s worked in restaurants since fourteen, it was Dane who got him his first gig in the downtown area, bussing tables on the decks. Despite his brief flirtation with advertising, Dagan never fully wrenched himself from behind the bar. What began as bussing, turned to bartending, turned to the acting General Manager at the Franklin Oyster House. And over that time his reverence for the bar has grown as deep as stout.\r\n\r\nNowadays the two are down in the trenches at the official Liars' Bench, sledgehammering concrete and pouring it.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"7","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:36:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"aCGZza","name":"Savannah River Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Savannah River Brewing Co","website":"https:\/\/www.savannahriverbrew.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aCGZza\/upload_JqYlht-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aCGZza\/upload_JqYlht-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aCGZza\/upload_JqYlht-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aCGZza\/upload_JqYlht-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/aCGZza\/upload_JqYlht-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-08 14:18:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:31:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"N92VWIHQZ4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lgof3h","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"813 %th St.","locality":"Augusta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30901","phone":"706-426-8212","latitude":33.7336413,"longitude":-84.3736435,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-26 19:06:44","updateDate":"2017-07-26 19:06:44","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zSZo8S","name":"No Joka Mocha","nameDisplay":"No Joka Mocha","description":"No Joka Mocha is a coffee oatmeal chocolate stout that is decidedly weighted towards the coffee end of the taste spectrum.
