The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4sqnr4","name":"Mi\u00f3d Pitny Czw\u00f3rniak Biesiadny","nameDisplay":"Mi\u00f3d Pitny Czw\u00f3rniak Biesiadny","abv":"12","styleId":148,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-30 00:13:52","updateDate":"2018-05-24 18:03:59","style":{"id":148,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Open Category Mead","shortName":"Mead","description":"This mead should exhibit the character of all of the ingredients in varying degrees, and should show a good blending or balance between the various flavor elements.

An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA.

It\u2019s what drove us to build a state-of-the-art destination brewery in the heart of the Twin Cities in 2014. And it\u2019s what drives us today. Don\u2019t settle.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"1cfDau","name":"Monday Night Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Monday Night","description":"Monday Night Brewing is an Atlanta-based craft beer company.
