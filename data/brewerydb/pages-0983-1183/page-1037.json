At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town).

It is also the pleasure of drinking a beer with friends that led Micha\u00ebl Jean to take an interest in beer, its aromas and all its subtleties.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, the young entrepreneur dreams of opening his own artisan microbrewery, but the necessary investment is a major obstacle. He discovers then that the search for partnership in the industrial sector could allow him to realize his dream. Why see little when we can see big? He is making the leap by developing and producing his own recipes with the Brisset beer team. The production of craft beers directly from a major brewer in Montreal gives him the opportunity to distribute his microbrewery products to all corners of the province in specialty grocery stores, restaurants and pubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of this momentum, towards the end of the summer of 2015, Le BockAle Microbrewery was finally established in Drummondville and produced in its own fermenters. A frankly nice pub is open to welcome all those for whom pleasure is a priority!\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the microbrewery created a line of raspberry, cherry, melon and pineapple cocktail syrups to concoct beer and refreshing cocktails. Once again, Le BockAle thinks big to better embellish small and big occasions to celebrate!\r\n\r\nTo celebrate is good, but to celebrate responsibly is even better! BockAle is today one of the only brewers to have developed, produced and offered a selection of non-alcoholic microbrewery beers in Quebec businesses.","website":"http:\/\/LeBockale.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"Microbrasserie@lebockale.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HIjy19\/upload_PQ08Jt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HIjy19\/upload_PQ08Jt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HIjy19\/upload_PQ08Jt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HIjy19\/upload_PQ08Jt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HIjy19\/upload_PQ08Jt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-09-09 15:38:13","updateDate":"2019-09-10 16:10:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cDyenX","name":"Microbrasserie Le Bockale","streetAddress":"2400 Rue Canadien","extendedAddress":"Suite 201","locality":"Drummondville","region":"Qu\u00e9bec","postalCode":"J2C 7W3","phone":"819-857-4857","website":"https:\/\/www.lebockale.com\/","latitude":45.8825857,"longitude":-72.5434565,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-09-09 15:46:33","updateDate":"2019-09-10 16:09:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-12:00am,fri-3:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HovlT0","name":"Milkshake Stout","nameDisplay":"Milkshake Stout","description":"Milkshake Stout is a sweet stout style Ale that combines four different malts along with a low hop level creating a deep dark beer featuring rich, roasted flavors.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":4.1,"betaAcidMin":4.7,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":55.1,"humuleneMax":55.1,"caryophylleneMin":14.5,"caryophylleneMax":14.6,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":26,"myrceneMin":15.5,"myrceneMax":17.5,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":0.1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:31","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":1922,"name":"Two-Row Pale Malt","description":"The is the standard starting point for almost all beer recipes.

We hope that you will enjoy drinking them as much as we enjoy brewing them!","website":"http:\/\/www.wiensbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7LrYr1\/upload_v0yX7a-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7LrYr1\/upload_v0yX7a-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7LrYr1\/upload_v0yX7a-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7LrYr1\/upload_v0yX7a-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7LrYr1\/upload_v0yX7a-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-24 23:44:37","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:32:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4HZILU85OQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"RNzhpm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27941 Diaz Rd.","extendedAddress":"Suite A","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 553-7111","website":"http:\/\/www.wiensbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Hours: M-Th: 3-8, F: 1-8\r\nWeekends: 12-8","latitude":33.5052427,"longitude":-117.1593155,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-24 23:46:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Hours: M-Th: 3-8, F: 1-8\r\nWeekends: 12-8","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gOGvjy","name":"Millennium Geuze","nameDisplay":"Millennium Geuze","description":"3 Fonteinen Millennium Geuze is a geuze bottled by Armand Debelder and Willem van Herreweghen of De Cam in the fall of 1998.

These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional gueuze lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.
