The Oatmeal Stout differs from the popular Irish stout in its more subtle roastiness and subdued dryness. The addition of flaked oats rounds out these sometimes harsh characteristics producing a velvet smooth ale. This black stout has a flavor profile unique to all of North America. Subtlety is not a strong point as it is a stout after all, rich and eminently drinkable. \r\n\r\nAlcohol content of approximately 5.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)","abv":"5","availableId":1,"styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:48","updateDate":"2015-03-12 15:49:47","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington.

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:13:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"UYOVWAHCBD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RW6Da0","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Laurel","region":"MD","postalCode":"20723","latitude":39.1426709,"longitude":-76.860565,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-03-14 17:43:05","updateDate":"2016-05-01 14:34:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pLDF9A","name":"Oatmeal Stout","nameDisplay":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"An aromatic blend of oats, chocolate and roast malts make up this classic English-Style Oatmeal Stout.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MTqeVB","name":"Oatmeal Stout","nameDisplay":"Oatmeal Stout","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:48","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:31","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewage.at","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:45:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mMnrjZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mittelgasse 4","locality":"1060 Wien","phone":"+43 1 9550935","website":"http:\/\/brewage.at\/","latitude":48.1939642,"longitude":16.3434939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","updateDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-7:00pm,wed-2:00pm-7:00pm,thu-2:00pm-7:00pm,fri-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"Europe\/Vienna","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qACg0q","name":"Oatmeal Stout \uf078","nameDisplay":"Oatmeal Stout \uf078","description":"The addition of flaked oats adds a \u201csmooth\u201d texture to this big black ale.

(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.

Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.\r\n \r\nIt is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .  We will participate in, and contribute to, local festivals and events that revolve around brewing, environmentalism, and the promotion of local businesses.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewlabcraft.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-06 17:17:38","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:03:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9768QXB2FA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9Hqlzg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4191-8 Carpinteria Ave.","locality":"Carpinteria","region":"California","postalCode":"93013","phone":"949.922.9152","latitude":34.4037704,"longitude":-119.5337568,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","updateDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-9:00pm,sat-4:00pm-9:00pm,sun-2:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jDg4xl","name":"Oats and Barley Stout","nameDisplay":"Oats and Barley Stout","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:48","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:48","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:25:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F0UN19LIE6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8dIvZw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1947 West 28th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484295,"longitude":-81.705375,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xSmsLL","name":"Great Lakes Brewpub","streetAddress":"2516 Market Avenue","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/brewpub\/around-the-brewpub","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484446,"longitude":-81.704436,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-10 17:48:32","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WFEkxV","name":"Oats Made Me Do It!","nameDisplay":"Oats Made Me Do It!","description":"WE COULDN'T DO A NORMAL PALE ALE.

We are located by the Southwest corner of 44th Ave. and Wadsworth Blvd.\r\n\r\nOur take on beer is simple \u2013 Use great ingredients and brew for flavor!  Rickoli\u2019s respects the liquid in the glass and wants to help elevate beer to a refined drinking experience. That\u2019s why we use the finest ingredients and brew in a leisurely manner. The beer tells us when it\u2019s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.\r\n\r\nOur Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick\u2019s special brews!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli\u2019s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.  Making great craft beer more accessible to everyone.\r\n  \r\nOur glass rinsing stations insure a beer clean glass every time! We want you to drink beer not sanitizer! We hope you will stop by for a pint or two!","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryrickoli.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0MtSfA\/upload_hcYyDA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0MtSfA\/upload_hcYyDA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0MtSfA\/upload_hcYyDA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0MtSfA\/upload_hcYyDA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0MtSfA\/upload_hcYyDA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-17 01:45:41","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:45:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"FAZ60U758H","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"NrF8QR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4335 Wadsworth","locality":"Wheat Ridge","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80033","phone":"(303) 344-8988","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryrickoli.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 3:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":39.7756487,"longitude":-105.0815258,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-17 11:37:18","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:46","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-3:00pm-9:00pm,tue-3:00pm-11:00pm,wed-3:00pm-11:00pm,thu-3:00pm-11:00pm,fri-12:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am,sun-12:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 3:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YfGN08","name":"Oats McGoats","nameDisplay":"Oats McGoats","description":"This delicious stout recipe won a Bronze medal at the 2014 Virginia Craft Brewers Cup!

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness).

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.
