The area has a semi-desert climate with hot days and cool nights. We choose deep, fresh soils, to delay ripening, and avoid hydrological stress. These are sandy loams where the clay component provides mineral nutrients and water retention, while the sand component prevents the silt and clay part from compacting excessively, and guarantees water drainage. In this climate we avoid soils with abundant superficial gravel, which increases the warming effect and might shorten the ripening season \u2013 which we rely on to give our Malbec its intensity and flavor.\r\n\r\nVINTAGE\r\nThe 2015 harvest can be summed up as a kind of a bipolar one. November, December and January had extremely high temperatures which accelerated the ripening process in the vineyards. These temperatures and quick ripening can dramatically decrease the level of natural acidity in the fruit, as sugar levels rise. In order to avoid this we decided to harvest 15 days earlier than the established date. Taking the window of opportunity from mid February to March 23rd, we picked up all the Malbec, even from the high altitude, cooler climates and vigorous soils.\r\n\r\nWINEMAKING\r\nGrapes from different vineyards are vinified separately before the final blend. After a careful, double sorting process, the grapes are softly pressed and fermented with indigenous yeasts in order to express each of the selected vineyard. Fermentation takes place in separate stainless steel tanks between 24-28\u00b0C for 10 days. Each tank is tasted three times a day to determine what is needed. The wine is then aged for 12 months in concrete vats.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES\r\nThe joyful and fresh expression of Mendoza is in this Malbec. Red fruits, cherries and a soft note of plums that have just been picked up from the tree. This wine is all about freshness. The palate is supple and juicy, inviting to enjoy glass after glass. Soft but structured tannins and a pleasant finish. Three words can describe this Malbec perfectly: freshness, joy and vitality. Can be paired with light fare or heavier dishes, but also can be enjoyed alone. The ideal service temperature is 64\u00b0F \u2013 18\u00b0C.","abv":"13.3","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-12 14:46:25","updateDate":"2017-01-12 14:46:25","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"},"breweries":[{"id":"53RO7I","name":"Altos Las Hormigas Winery","nameShortDisplay":"Altos Las Hormigas Winery","description":"In 1995 Alberto Antonini, a well-known Tuscan winemaker, and Antonio Morescalchi, a young entrepreneur, took a trip to visit the burgeoning wine areas of South America. It only took one stop to find what they were looking for. They were immediately impressed by the vineyards thriving in the high altitude and dry climate of Mendoza, and were captivated by the whispered traditions and blend of cultures.\r\n\r\nThey returned to Tuscany powerfully impressed not only by the region, but also by the unexplored potential of Malbec, a grape that had a strong local tradition but was largely ignored and misunderstood.  While the rest of the wine world saw Mendoza struggling to shed its bulk wine image, the two young Italians saw Mendoza as a place where traditional viticultural values and unblemished land could be reinvigorated with a modern winemaking approach and international experience. Instead of planting Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, as many others were doing during the 1990s, the team decided to invest their confidence in Malbec. Today, Malbec is the varietal for which Argentina is best known.\r\n\r\nAgainst all odds they cemented their vision to become Terroir Specialists Shortly after, two friends and business partners, also enthused by the idea, joined the venture: Attilio Pagli, a renowned Tuscan winemaker with two 100 point-scoring wines in his personal record and Carlos Vazquez, an Argentine Agronomist, who work for 20 years with the early Catena group, planting new varieties, developing previously unknown vineyard sites and contributing greatly to the qualitative change of Argentine viticulture early on.","website":"http:\/\/www.altoslashormigas.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/53RO7I\/upload_hJcuu5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/53RO7I\/upload_hJcuu5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/53RO7I\/upload_hJcuu5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/53RO7I\/upload_hJcuu5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/53RO7I\/upload_hJcuu5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-12 14:42:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qIbILx","name":"Main Winery","streetAddress":"5585 Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo","locality":"La Legua","region":"Argentina","latitude":-32.9765865,"longitude":-69.1699785,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AR","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-12 14:44:34","updateDate":"2017-09-06 15:03:03","timezoneId":"America\/Mendoza","country":{"isoCode":"AR","name":"ARGENTINA","displayName":"Argentina","isoThree":"ARG","numberCode":32,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dhUeOL","name":"Malbec Pyment","nameDisplay":"Malbec Pyment","abv":"14","styleId":144,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 21:52:47","updateDate":"2018-05-16 16:06:09","style":{"id":144,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pyment (Grape Melomel)","shortName":"Pyment","description":"In well-made examples of the style, the grape is both distinctively vinous and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead.

Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WUUCwX","name":"Maldita Bohemian Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Maldita Bohemian Pilsner","abv":"5.5","styleId":76,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-12 09:08:01","updateDate":"2015-10-16 17:13:54","style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color.

These beers should have deposit, because besides any indication of handmade process demonstrates that there has been fermentation in the bottle.","website":"http:\/\/www.maldita.pt\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/22Q75i\/upload_v37dGA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/22Q75i\/upload_v37dGA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/22Q75i\/upload_v37dGA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/22Q75i\/upload_v37dGA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/22Q75i\/upload_v37dGA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-09 08:15:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jRVSNH","name":"Headquarters","locality":"Aveiro","latitude":40.6405055,"longitude":-8.6537539,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"PT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-10 02:59:04","updateDate":"2015-10-16 17:13:47","timezoneId":"Europe\/Lisbon","country":{"isoCode":"PT","name":"PORTUGAL","displayName":"Portugal","isoThree":"PRT","numberCode":620,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"reTHGd","name":"Maldoror","nameDisplay":"Maldoror","abv":"6.2","ibu":"28","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-29 20:56:29","updateDate":"2018-05-30 16:26:51","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

In 2015 a vacant Rock Hill, SC car dealership was purchased and converted into a craft brewery and brewpub.

These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied.
