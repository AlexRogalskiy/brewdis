For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"zhO2k0","name":"Oettinger Brauerei","nameShortDisplay":"Oettinger Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/oettinger-bier.de\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:37","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mBpv9h","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Wolfenb\u00fctteler Stra\u00dfe 33","locality":"Braunschweig","postalCode":"38102","latitude":52.265435,"longitude":10.52736,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 14:21:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jA42T8","name":"Original Organic","nameDisplay":"Original Organic","description":"Ontario\u2019s first certified organic lager was born in 2002 from a sense of purpose and a passion for craft beer.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

A roasted malt character which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"HO0KcL","name":"Intergalactic Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Intergalactic","description":"We are a San Diego Based Pilot Brewery, currently operating on a Nano-Scale brewing system.","website":"http:\/\/www.intergalacticbrew.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HO0KcL\/upload_bFbIWb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HO0KcL\/upload_bFbIWb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HO0KcL\/upload_bFbIWb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HO0KcL\/upload_bFbIWb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HO0KcL\/upload_bFbIWb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"11gqIZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9835 Carroll Centre Rd #108","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92126","phone":"(858) 750-0601","website":"http:\/\/www.intergalacticbrew.com\/","latitude":32.89875,"longitude":-117.120481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qExyAi","name":"Orkey's VAN(illa)","nameDisplay":"Orkey's VAN(illa)","description":"Vanilla Russian Imperial Stout","abv":"10","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:50:32","updateDate":"2015-09-08 20:50:32","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Soon after, we were introduced to our first Belgian style beers (Chimay, LaChouffe) and have been hooked on good beer ever since.  It progressed to the inevitable challenge of making our own home brew versions of the shared beers we loved and with the donation of our first brewing equipment from a friend, we started our beer making journey about 18 years ago.  From the beginning, we both found common ground having similar tastes in beer styles which progressed to a shared obsession of trying to figure out how our favorites were made.  We both shared in the fun of sharing our results with friends and watching their reactions, which kept us motivated to make more.  Now, I think we play to each other\u0080\u0099s strengths.  Mike is excited about the technical part of brewing and Greg enjoys determining flavor combinations and fun new things to try.  Our joint passion to make fun, creative craft beer coupled with our individual strengths makes a good brewing team that works well together.","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"mikeo@deviatebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:40:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:21:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WGBS5VOAFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HB7F1d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4004 W. 96th St.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46268","phone":"999-999-9999","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Closed to brew\r\nTuesday - Closed to brew\r\nWednesday - Closed for now\r\nThursday - Closed for now\r\nFriday - 5 pm to 10 pm\r\nSaturday - Noon to 10 pm\r\nSunday - Noon to 6pm","latitude":39.9265355,"longitude":-86.2289472,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","updateDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-5:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Closed to brew\r\nTuesday - Closed to brew\r\nWednesday - Closed for now\r\nThursday - Closed for now\r\nFriday - 5 pm to 10 pm\r\nSaturday - Noon to 10 pm\r\nSunday - Noon to 6pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
