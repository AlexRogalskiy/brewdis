One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"YCE6yo","name":"Bistronomy B2B","nameShortDisplay":"Bistronomy B2B","description":"New Mexican products from grass-fed beef to fresh craft beers!","website":"http:\/\/www.BistronomyB2b.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YCE6yo\/upload_ZxNwTc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YCE6yo\/upload_ZxNwTc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YCE6yo\/upload_ZxNwTc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YCE6yo\/upload_ZxNwTc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YCE6yo\/upload_ZxNwTc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:52:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:34:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OE54YZPIXJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Rb72xX","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"3118 Central Ave SE","locality":"Albuquerque","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87106","phone":"(505) 262-2222","website":"http:\/\/www.BistronomyB2b.com","latitude":35.0803321,"longitude":-106.6101268,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:53:09","updateDate":"2014-07-25 13:53:09","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:30pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:30pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-9:00pm,tue-4:00pm-9:00pm,wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-12:00pm-9:30pm,fri-12:00pm-10:30pm,sat-12:00pm-10:30pm,sun-12:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sIJ5Oc","name":"Ola Cream Ale","nameDisplay":"Ola Cream Ale","abv":"5","ibu":"10","glasswareId":5,"srmId":2,"availableId":1,"styleId":109,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"very_cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Very Cold - (0-4C\/32-39F)","originalGravity":"1.046","createDate":"2018-07-03 00:13:35","updateDate":"2018-07-03 18:51:26","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":2,"name":"2","hex":"FFD878"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":109,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Cream Ale or Lager","shortName":"Cream Ale","description":"Mild, pale, light-bodied ale, made using a warm fermentation (top or bottom) and cold lagering.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ix655q","name":"Harviestoun Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Harviestoun","description":"The brewery was founded in 1984 by Ken Brooker on a farm just outside Dollar in Central Scotland.

However, in the wake of the acquisition of Caledonian brewing Company by Scottish & Newcastle UK, the brewery became independent once again in 2008 by three noble shareholders who sought to preserve the status as an independent award-winning micro-brewery. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Harviestoun is going through some new and exciting changes to expand the brewery. We are working hard to increase production, while insuring that we still outputting nothing but quality beer.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
