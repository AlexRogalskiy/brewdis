The name Gentle Ben\u2019s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington. Martha was a mean bear by people standards and had to be kept chained to a stake. The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben\u2019s Brewing Company of Tucson\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson.

A Vanderbilt graduate, Mark spent eight years working in sports marketing and development before jumping into the beer world.  He\u2019s a tall guy.  \u201cCircus freak\u201d tall, according to an old lady at the Phoenix airport.  He loves barbecue.  Actually it\u2019s kind of an issue for him.\r\n\r\nMark got into craft beer on a family trip to Oregon in 2004.  The Oregon Brewers Festival opened his eyes to a whole new world of beer and he\u2019s been hooked ever since.\r\n\r\nShortly after moving back to Nashville in 2009, Mark got involved with the Oasis Center through his high school friend Anderson Williams.  After a couple of beers and some brainstorming on how to get the word out about Oasis, the idea for Jubilee came up.  In March of 2010, the first batch of Jubilee Nut Brown Ale hit the shelves in Middle Tennessee, thanks to the good folks at Bluegrass Brewing Company.  In January of 2013, Jubilee brought production closer to home, partnering with Mayday Brewery in Murfreesboro TN to release Randy\u2019s IPA.\r\n\r\nWho\u2019s Randy? Well\u2026\u201dRandy\u201d first appeared at Mark\u2019s mom\u2019s 60th birthday party.  When his own mom didn\u2019t recognize him for 15 minutes (including taking pictures with him), he knew he had a good thing going.  After all, who doesn\u2019t love a mullet-toting, jort-wearing 6\u20196\u2033 craft beer aficionado?

Owner and brewer Paul Wright began his brewing adventures after receiving a homebrew kit for Christmas in 1991 in Novato, CA. He joined the local brew club and started winning awards for his beers. Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level. We serve local bars, restaurants, and retail outlets and have five and fifteen-gallon kegs and 22-ounce bottles available for weddings, caterers, as well as for thirsty individuals that happen to come our way. We\u2019ve now opened a new brewery in beautiful downtown Carpinteria and hope you\u2019ll stop by to visit soon.","website":"http:\/\/www.islandbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-09 19:06:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"X5T30MZ4IU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"3A5MHE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5049 Sixth Street","locality":"Carpinteria","region":"California","postalCode":"93013","phone":"1-805-745-8272","website":"http:\/\/www.islandbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":34.3960285,"longitude":-119.5210401,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Rtj0DX","name":"Nut Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Nut Brown Ale","abv":"4.8","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:47","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:44","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
