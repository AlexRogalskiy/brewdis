Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"iItvMx","name":"Meierhof Privatbrauerei","nameShortDisplay":"Meierhof Privatbrauerei","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"b58sGA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Kirchwinkel 10","locality":"H\u00f6xter-Ottbergen","region":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","postalCode":"D-37671","latitude":51.708,"longitude":9.30458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:46:17","updateDate":"2017-08-25 17:05:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jhiTrj","name":"Meierhof Bio Weizen","nameDisplay":"Meierhof Bio Weizen","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:15:42","updateDate":"2018-11-06 18:58:57","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

Blending these barrels into funky, complex and sometimes sour beer is an historical art form that we celebrate in our space.\r\n\r\nOur experimentation also extends to that most important of beer ingredients, yeast. Many Springdale beers are fermented with classic ale yeast strains, rather than our parent brewery\u2019s lager yeasts. These yeasts express themselves in our beers with spicy, fruity characteristics that are classic in many styles that we have have long loved, such as saison.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the ideal that beer needs to remain fun. Our space is decked out with pinball, skeeball, arcade games and other classics that remind us of birthday parties of our youth.\r\n\r\nWhy ale?!\r\nJack\u2019s Abby Craft Lagers was founded in 2011 by brothers Jack, Eric and Sam Hendler with the goal of brewing world-class, German-style lagers. After several years of expansion, the brothers decided that the challenge of working with ale yeasts and sour cultures was too tempting to pass up. Springdale Barrel Room is built with experimentation in mind as we seek to push ourselves and our beers into uncharted territories.","website":"http:\/\/springdalebeer.com\/","mailingListUrl":"info@springdalebeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-08 20:37:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8OGRRL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"102 Clinton St.","locality":"Framingham","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01702","phone":"(508) 872-0900","latitude":42.2794958,"longitude":-71.4097844,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-08 20:41:05","updateDate":"2017-01-08 20:41:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2KYHb0","name":"M\u00e9lange No. 1","nameDisplay":"M\u00e9lange No. 1","description":"M\u00e9lange No 1 - A blend of our award winning Oude Tart Flemish red with our infamous Black Tuesday imperial Stout.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.
