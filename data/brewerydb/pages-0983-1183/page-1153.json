Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

With the addition of orange peel in the brew the beer has an enhanced refreshing flavour. Inspired by an island that sits just 2 miles from the brewery. In the 18th Century boats seeking passage through the Thames would be forced to stop there to pay gold in order to continue up river. The island also played a role in the Civil War, where Oliver Cromwell was reported to have taken refuge via a mysterious under-ground tunnel that is still yet to be found.","abv":"4.5","availableId":1,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RWW9Gs\/upload_jbO9rY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RWW9Gs\/upload_jbO9rY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RWW9Gs\/upload_jbO9rY-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RWW9Gs\/upload_jbO9rY-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RWW9Gs\/upload_jbO9rY-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RWW9Gs\/upload_jbO9rY-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-15 23:21:03","updateDate":"2016-03-17 16:16:29","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

And we should know a little something about regional pride: Since we started in 1844, we've welcomed 24 new states into the Union. Today, Pabst crafts over 25 classic brews with strict adherence to original standards of quality. Our brands rack up national and international festival awards. Most important, they continue to make memories in the places that mean a lot to our consumers.","website":"http:\/\/www.pabst.com\/","established":"1844","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AKyyYN\/upload_1CzLk8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AKyyYN\/upload_1CzLk8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AKyyYN\/upload_1CzLk8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AKyyYN\/upload_1CzLk8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AKyyYN\/upload_1CzLk8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ct1Zeb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"PO Box 1661","locality":"San Antonio","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78296","phone":"1-800-935-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.pabst.com\/","latitude":29.4497864,"longitude":-98.5386319,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1844","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-08-29 13:42:15","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0UGeR1","name":"Olympic Peninsula Ale","nameDisplay":"Olympic Peninsula Ale","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0UGeR1\/upload_n70wk2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0UGeR1\/upload_n70wk2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0UGeR1\/upload_n70wk2-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0UGeR1\/upload_n70wk2-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0UGeR1\/upload_n70wk2-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0UGeR1\/upload_n70wk2-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-25 11:39:56","updateDate":"2018-11-06 20:32:05","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley. Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"OgIQLx","name":"Fathom & League Hop Yard Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Fathom & League Hop Yard","description":"Fathom & League Hop Yard Brewery is dedicated to the first brewers in the Pacific Northwest.
