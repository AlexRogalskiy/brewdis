Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"RBaOzm","name":"Black Pond Brews","nameShortDisplay":"Black Pond Brews","description":"We (Mike and Cory) started brewing in January 2010 because we both love beer. It didn't take long before the act, the ideas, and the processes of brewing began to take over our lives. Shortly thereafter we dubbed ourselves Black Pond Brews, after a pond where we had some fun and memorable times in Woodstock, CT. Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success. Spurred by this success and by the constant clamoring of our friends and family to make more beer, we really began to ask ourselves: how do we turn this passion for producing beer into a commercial reality?\r\n \r\nOur project is not only valuable to us, but to the community in which we will operate.  Our beautiful, quiet town of Danielson, CT will become a destination for anyone who loves beer, be they local or travellers.  Who doesn't love beer?  Further, who doesn't love MORE beer to try?!\r\n \r\nWhat inspires us?\r\nThe ability to write or create something unique, something revolutionary. Clara Barton once said \u201cI defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past\". Such a philosophy is inherent in the way we approach brewing. Breweries often spend much of their time and effort looking back to past recipes- often times as far back as the inception of brewing itself- but what of the future? What new ideas and flavors can we explore? We are always pushing the envelope against the grain- but our guiding star will always be uncompromising flavor of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackpondbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:28:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5ZRH7TLIX4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"t8ecnf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21A Furnace St","locality":"Danielson","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06239","phone":"860-207-5295","website":"http:\/\/BlackPondBrews.com","hoursOfOperation":"We are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","latitude":41.804121,"longitude":-71.883942,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:38:21","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-5:00pm-8:00pm,fri-5:00pm-8:00pm,sat-3:00pm-8:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"We are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RcQh5z","name":"Macintosh Cider","nameDisplay":"Macintosh Cider","abv":"6","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-02-16 19:22:04","updateDate":"2019-02-16 19:22:04","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"aTgiD7","name":"Macon Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Macon","description":"Macon Beer Company, LLC is a craft beer company focused on innovation, sustainability, philanthropy, and developing a strong connection to our employees and community.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours.
