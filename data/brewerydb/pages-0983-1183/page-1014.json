The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

By the early 1980s, the last one had shuttered its doors. So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:25:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F0UN19LIE6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8dIvZw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1947 West 28th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484295,"longitude":-81.705375,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xSmsLL","name":"Great Lakes Brewpub","streetAddress":"2516 Market Avenue","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/brewpub\/around-the-brewpub","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484446,"longitude":-81.704436,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-10 17:48:32","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7Nx6L4","name":"Maverick Chocolate Porter","nameDisplay":"Maverick Chocolate Porter","description":"Brown porter brewed with cacao nibs and roasted cacao husks from our friends at Maverick Chocolate.

Heroic will brew old world, new world, ancient, and even unknown styles, at least to the American beer drinkers.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re not just brewers, we\u2019re NERDS. Every beer we create represents a fully realized superhero or villain that lives, fights, and, with input from you, survives or dies in our very own comic book universe, illustrated in stunning detail by leading international and local comic artists.\r\n\r\nNot only do we have our core group of \u201cHeroes\u201d , but we\u2019ll also have rotating characters as seasonal brews get released. These characters come to life in our tasting room and on the store shelves!\r\n\r\nWe plan to release exclusive annual comics for our customers at events and new beer releases. All while inviting everyone to our taproom which will feature geek trivia nights, cosplay events, role play gaming nights, an entirely free arcade and more as our build out continues. If you host a D&D or any other role playing or table top games, give us a call, we\u2019ll reserve a table!","website":"http:\/\/heroicaleworks.com\/","established":"2017","mailingListUrl":"jon@heroicaleworks.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fElgI4\/upload_spEErd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fElgI4\/upload_spEErd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fElgI4\/upload_spEErd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fElgI4\/upload_spEErd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fElgI4\/upload_spEErd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-09 14:00:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"N1i3kD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"14910 Persistence Drive","locality":"Woodbridge","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22191","latitude":38.6284861,"longitude":-77.2529261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-09 14:02:33","updateDate":"2017-01-09 14:02:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-12:00pm-10:00pm,tue-12:00pm-10:00pm,wed-12:00pm-10:00pm,thu-12:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-12:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6IrBOJ","name":"Max Q","nameDisplay":"Max Q","description":"Max q is the maximum value of dynamic pressure on the rocket as it accelerates up through the atmosphere.

Thanks to this crazy new bar in Winnetka, CA and our buddy the bartender, we were introduced to new styles of beer that were much different than the commercial brands we were used to. After many conversations on the process of making beer and the brewing techniques of smaller breweries, we decided to take a chance at brewing our own malted, adult beverages! \r\n\r\nWe signed up for a Maltose Falcons class, bought a brewing kit and a turkey fryer and made a batch of beer on June 23, 2012. After this first batch, we were hooked! We invested more time in learning about the process, fabricated custom brewing equipment and experimented with new recipes while tweaking them to make them our own. \r\n\r\nAfter serving samples of our homemade brews and getting positive feedback, we began talking of doing it legit and opening up a brewery!  Given our Valley roots and the fact our beer was brewed out of a garage in Sylmar, CA, we decided 818 Brewing was the perfect name and we filed our paperwork in October 2014 for our new venture.\r\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ve enjoyed the most along our journey is the sense of community within the craft brew scene. Not many products can bring together men and women of different nationalities, age groups, religious beliefs, income levels, political views \u2013 and even fellow brewers! \u2013 And create a moment of common ground.  8 one 8 Brewing is proud to offer a product that brings us together to say cheers!","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home\/?age-verified=cd0a2fef44","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:30:46","updateDate":"2019-07-02 19:08:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AH21G7RNY4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"GTwDJI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8951 De Soto Ave.","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:31:54","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"73xdsm","name":"8one8 brewery","streetAddress":"8951 de soto ave","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-08-09 23:43:32","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:44","forwardingId":"GTwDJI","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xL6IHz","name":"MAX Stout","nameDisplay":"MAX Stout (2014)","description":"Don't let the high alcohol in this ale frighten you.

With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.
