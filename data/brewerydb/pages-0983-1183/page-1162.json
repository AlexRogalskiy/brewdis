Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","established":"1994","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001uBxRG66eq3ajbdfZ6GjL91di7O20EmmX","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:42:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IMU3ZJH0NL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jPbb33","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2000 Lyons Avenue","locality":"Houston","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77020","phone":"713-686-9494","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","latitude":29.7715192,"longitude":-95.3484972,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8vnAiG","name":"Orange SLYce Session IPA","nameDisplay":"Orange SLYce Session IPA","description":"This zesty session IPA is brewed with orange for a bright flavor complemented by the juicy hop combo of Cascade and Citra.

The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:40:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M8ICS1LEDY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wbpj5b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3912 W McLean Ave","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60647","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.9180876,"longitude":-87.7260612,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-06-16 17:16:46","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZDOb9R","name":"Orange U Glad","nameDisplay":"Orange U Glad","abv":"3.5","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-12 20:59:35","updateDate":"2015-03-12 20:59:35","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

In our Garage, you can find what drives us \u2014 quality craft beer.\r\n\r\n\u200bEstablished in 2013, we began brewing in what was once an eight bay garage at the end of Old Town Temecula. The brewpub and taproom was aptly named Garage Brewing Co, not only due to its previous life, but to show an appreciation to where the craft beer industry originated \u2014 in the garages of brewers. Here, we have created a family-friendly environment where our fast-fired, Kustom-built pizzas and quality, Kustom craft beers provide unlimited possibilities of flavor while bringing friends and family together. In 2016, we expanded our business and now also have an off-site, full production brewery in Murrieta, CA.\r\n\r\n\u200bFrom the beginning, we set out on a mission: to provide top-quality craft beer that tastes fantastic and appeals to a broad spectrum of beer lovers. We are committed to excellence and only use the finest ingredients, state-of-the art equipment, and top-notch coding processes.\r\n\r\n\u200bWe maintain six core, year-round styles while also regularly rotating in seasonal creations for a total of \u00b1 15 beers on tap at all times.  As an independent brewery, we are free to modify beer recipes and develop exciting and creative spins on standard styles to please all types of beer advocates.  We routinely offer new and interesting beers to bring our customers a truly unique experience. \r\n \r\nOur brewery equipment was manufacured in North America by a company that has built over 350 breweries and has over 25 years of experience in the craft brewing industry. This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves an exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:24:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:47:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYX5KUDZEG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Jki0lE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29095 Old Town Front Street","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 587-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":33.4825051,"longitude":-117.1432478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"b2t3HD","name":"Orange Vanilla Cream Ale","nameDisplay":"Orange Vanilla Cream Ale","description":"Highly drinkable cream ale with a refreshing fresh orange zest character.","abv":"5.6","styleId":109,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-17 20:32:10","updateDate":"2018-06-17 20:32:10","style":{"id":109,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Cream Ale or Lager","shortName":"Cream Ale","description":"Mild, pale, light-bodied ale, made using a warm fermentation (top or bottom) and cold lagering.

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

One spring day, we made the decision to quit our jobs and start a brewery. Shortly after that, we bought our first homebrew kit and brewed our first few batches. We knew that this is what we wanted to do with our lives. Our family encouraged us and helped us gather enough equipment to open our brewery. We became licensed to sell beer in Washington in January of 2010. We opened our new location and taproom at 2018 E Riverside Ave, Suite #1 in Spokane in May of 2011. We take pride in brewing quality beers made with the freshest ingredients around. All of our brews also contain a special touch of \u201cBudge Bros Magic\u201d. We have many exciting plans for the future, including an exclusive \u201cPlastic Cup Club\u201d, special events at the Taproom, seasonal brews, and cool new merchandise. We also serve the best Popcorn in the Greater Spokane Area.\r\n\r\nWhile you\u2019re here, feel free to poke around and check out the types of beer we brew. Don\u2019t be afraid to take a look at us and see some of our videos, photos, and games created for your enjoyment. If you are looking to find our brews at other spots in Spokane, check out this page, and if you want to see us in your favorite pub, tavern, or bar don\u2019t hesitate to let us know.","website":"http:\/\/budgebrothers.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JAvSVM\/upload_tOnv0i-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JAvSVM\/upload_tOnv0i-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JAvSVM\/upload_tOnv0i-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JAvSVM\/upload_tOnv0i-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JAvSVM\/upload_tOnv0i-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 03:49:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jIv9sL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2018 E.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
