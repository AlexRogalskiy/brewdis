We believe that having a \u201cneighborhood brewery\u201d where people come to enjoy good beer, camaraderie and see what is available on any given day is a very viable concept. Our approach builds in flexibility with the product and marketing plan. It will allow us to build the best beers we can and stay focused on that. We will have flexibility to experiment and have a chance to be directly interactive with and interested in our customer base.","website":"https:\/\/www.dogberrybrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-20 20:25:55","updateDate":"2018-12-10 20:47:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MIWEU8P9LD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WMC12U","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9964 Crescent Park Dr","locality":"West Chester Township","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45069","phone":"(513) 847-8208","latitude":39.3042567,"longitude":-84.4196302,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-06 15:31:36","updateDate":"2017-09-06 15:31:36","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hUhmVn","name":"Marabunta","nameDisplay":"Marabunta","description":"An extremely hoppy beer, blonde, aromatic and obscenely bitter.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"0s8yID","name":"Rhinegeist","nameShortDisplay":"Rhinegeist","description":"Rhinegeist is a brewery out of Cincinnati, OH that was built within the skeleton of the old Moerlein bottling plant (built in 1895).

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.
