The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"HHngCL","name":"Brouwerij De Prael","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij De Prael","website":"http:\/\/deprael.nl\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HHngCL\/upload_eHv4kF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HHngCL\/upload_eHv4kF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HHngCL\/upload_eHv4kF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HHngCL\/upload_eHv4kF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HHngCL\/upload_eHv4kF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-02 11:34:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0K21pW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Oudezijds Voorburgwal 30","locality":"Amsterdam","phone":"+31(0)20 4084470","website":"http:\/\/www.deprael.com\/","latitude":52.3753225,"longitude":4.8995455,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-02 11:37:26","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:59:00","timezoneId":"Europe\/Amsterdam","country":{"isoCode":"NL","name":"NETHERLANDS","displayName":"Netherlands","isoThree":"NLD","numberCode":528,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KTkKQZ","name":"Mary","nameDisplay":"Mary","description":"Mary was Edward's mother and our great-grandmother.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Word got out about Crow Peaks great beers starting a dedicated fan base. With the popularity of the beer growing, so did the brewery.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2009 we opened the doors to our new building and 30 barrel brewhouse.\r\n\r\nCrow Peak beers can be found on tap and in cans throughout South Dakota, North Dakota, Omaha, NE, and Eastern Wyoming. We are proud to distribute  11th Hour IPA,  Pile of Dirt Porter and Canyon Cream Ale, as well as a number of seasonal offerings.","website":"http:\/\/www.crowpeakbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:02:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KROLGX9A78","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"bA9hdh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"125 West Highway 14","locality":"Spearfish","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57783","phone":"605-717-0006","website":"http:\/\/www.crowpeakbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm","latitude":44.5177631,"longitude":-103.8710587,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:07","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uq58YR","name":"M\u00e4rzen","nameDisplay":"M\u00e4rzen","abv":"5.5","styleId":82,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:10:29","updateDate":"2012-08-19 13:08:37","style":{"id":82,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Oktoberfest \/ Wiesen (Meadow)","shortName":"Oktoberfest","description":"Today's Oktoberfest beers are characterized by a medium body and light, golden color.
