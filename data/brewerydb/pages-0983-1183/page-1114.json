Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Y3OHGD","name":"Nugget\u2019s Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Nugget\u2019s Brown Ale","description":"A full bodied robust brown ale, with slight honey overtones never bitter always satisfying.","glasswareId":5,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-23 02:44:58","updateDate":"2012-04-23 02:44:58","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

Six varieties of premium malted barley provide the beer with a deep, mahogany color and a rich flavor. Hints of cocoa, dates, freshly-baked biscuits and toasted almonds come to the forefront, while the malty, sweet finish is balanced by a smooth bitterness, subtle fruitiness and a mild hop aroma.\r\n\r\nAlthough quite smooth and easy on the palate, Nut Brown Ale boasts flavors rich enough to stand up to many hearty foods throughout the cooler months. Look for strong, caramelized malt flavors from the roasted barley that share similar characteristics with the flavors of roasted or grilled meats.\r\nRecommended Foods: Aged Gouda, Creamy Soups, Chili, Steak and Potatoes, Venison Sausage, Grilled Meats, Grilled Roof Vegetables, Brownies","abv":"5.6","ibu":"26","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/kIi8qg\/upload_y32gev-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/kIi8qg\/upload_y32gev-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/kIi8qg\/upload_y32gev-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/kIi8qg\/upload_y32gev-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/kIi8qg\/upload_y32gev-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/kIi8qg\/upload_y32gev-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:47","updateDate":"2015-12-15 22:26:44","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
