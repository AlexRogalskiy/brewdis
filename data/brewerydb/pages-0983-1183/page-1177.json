John had started brewing on a beer kit and Aaron taught him the art of brewing all grain beers on his home made system. The planning of Tin Cannon came through many days of brewing with together in Aaron's dedicated brew room, or in John's garage. Aaron is an engineering guru and built a tremendous 10 gallon brewing system on his own, to include an electric master control panel. John likes to tinker and build stuff, and built stir plates, mash tuns, a kegerator and the like. When two innovative minds get together, they bring ingenuity, focus, style and creativity to each beer they brew.

Low in carbon dioxide, these hazy beers are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Cloudiness is acceptable. These beers are quite dry and light bodied. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambicstyle\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet. Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8.1","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:34"},"breweries":[{"id":"Abu2Ka","name":"Primitive Beer","nameShortDisplay":"Primitive Beer","description":"Primitive Beer is Colorado's first exclusively spontaneous, barrel-fermented beer blendery.
