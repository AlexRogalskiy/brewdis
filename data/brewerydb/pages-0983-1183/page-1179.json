Here at NoDa Brewing, there's hops in our logo so you know we've been wanting to brew up an Imperial IPA since the beginning. Bold Pacific Northwestern hops combine with New Zealand hop varieties to give us a full Pacific hop assault in the form of Nelson Sauvin, Pacific Jade, Centennial, Columbus, Warrior, and Amarillo.

Pacific Schwarzbock is true to German-style bocks, with an alcohol content of 8%, yet remarkably drinkable with no alcohol taste but a nice warm body that beer connoisseurs are looking for.\r\n\r\nPacific Schwarzbock is brewed with just enough black malts to give the beer its deep black color without tasting burned. In fact, to the contrary, Pacific Schwarzbock has a nice velvety body with lots of warm mouth feel. The black malts come through just enough to provide a subtle hint of coffee notes.","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":84,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-31 13:06:40","updateDate":"2015-12-16 17:54:24","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":84,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","shortName":"Schwarzbier","description":"These very dark brown to black beers have a mild roasted malt character without the associated bitterness.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.

A seed, carefully planted and nurtured, growing with the energy of the sun, Earth, wind, and rain. The fruits harvested, later release their seeds, and the cycle of life starts again. When Four Quarters creates new beers, it\u2019s celebrating the Earth and everything that grows within. Our logo shows the moon phases, which encapsulates this cycle, present in every living thing. The hope is that by thoughtfully crafting each and every beer with this cycle in mind, as well as the purpose of every ingredient used, the brewery can pass to its drinkers not just a glass of delicious brew, but its passion, its love, and its thankfulness for all things in the natural world.","website":"http:\/\/www.fourquartersbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NSuJV9\/upload_Wlz41A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NSuJV9\/upload_Wlz41A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NSuJV9\/upload_Wlz41A-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NSuJV9\/upload_Wlz41A-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NSuJV9\/upload_Wlz41A-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-07 11:16:48","updateDate":"2019-08-23 19:49:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AC8SW7M9X1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9e2CN5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 West Canal St","extendedAddress":"Suite 1","locality":"Winooski","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05404","website":"http:\/\/Www.4qbc.com","latitude":44.4905931,"longitude":-73.1927357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-07 11:16:49","updateDate":"2017-08-22 16:29:50","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gEmunS","name":"Paddle Out","nameDisplay":"Paddle Out","description":"This golden ale is easy to drink, with a mellow maltiness thanks to Munich malt and Belgian Biscuit.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery
