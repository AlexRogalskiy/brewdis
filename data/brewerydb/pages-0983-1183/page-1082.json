It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"tCTd8j","name":"Veterans United Craft Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Veterans United Craft","description":"Veterans United Craft Brewery is a veteran owned and operated company. \r\n\r\nWe are dedicated to satiating healthy appetites with flavorful beer through the use of fresh, quality ingredients and hope to expand the definition of what beer can be through our hard work and innovation.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Three of us had sustained minor injuries from the hard landing and required some medical attention. We were helped by some local villagers to a small monastery about a mile from where we landed. There we happened upon a freaky little friar named Fritz. While we were being cared after, Fritz told us his life story, being abandoned by his mother(a magical Pixie) and his father( a wayward Trappist Monk name La Salle who left the ministry and beer making to become an explorer). He was orphaned and left at the monastery to be raised by monks. The years pass by and Fritz learned the art of making \ufb01ne Belgium beers. And, as is the tradition with monks, Fritz loved sharing his incredible beers with us, the needy.\r\n\r\nOne night while drinking quite heavily, Fritz con\ufb01ded to us that his passion for beer and his lack of discipline would always keep him from rising in the ranks at the church, and that his naughty nature would keep him from ever being Head Brewmaster at the monastery. So the four of us decided to open a Brewery back in America and that we would call it the, \" Naughty Monk Brewery\".

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"beerVariation":{"id":"oeGSxs","name":"Naughty 90","nameDisplay":"Naughty 90","abv":"6.2","ibu":"100","styleId":30,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:45","updateDate":"2017-10-16 12:30:03","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"XcRYiw","name":"Navigation Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Navigation","description":"Our passion is brewing quality handcrafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.navigationbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XcRYiw\/upload_44D083-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XcRYiw\/upload_44D083-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XcRYiw\/upload_44D083-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XcRYiw\/upload_44D083-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XcRYiw\/upload_44D083-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 01:11:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:47:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OEP48IU0ZJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"KvSwJR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"122 Western Ave","locality":"Lowell","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01851","website":"http:\/\/www.navigationbrewing.com","latitude":42.6397829,"longitude":-71.3191833,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 01:15:44","updateDate":"2017-08-22 17:19:08","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TMc6H2","name":"Navigator Doppelbock","nameDisplay":"Navigator Doppelbock","abv":"8.9","styleId":90,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TMc6H2\/upload_DWnuKe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TMc6H2\/upload_DWnuKe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TMc6H2\/upload_DWnuKe-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TMc6H2\/upload_DWnuKe-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TMc6H2\/upload_DWnuKe-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TMc6H2\/upload_DWnuKe-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:45","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:32:53","style":{"id":90,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Doppelbock","shortName":"Doppelbock","description":"Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world.

That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington.

The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben\u2019s Brewing Company of Tucson\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:49"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y1yCgh","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Run","description":"Crooked Run Brewing is an award winning small brewery located in Sterling, Virginia, with an original nanobrewery located in Leesburg, Virginia","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:20:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:22:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HPJZNL1S6Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"gssG96","name":"Brewery\/Bar","streetAddress":"205 Harrison Street","locality":"Leesburg","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20175","phone":"(571) 918-4446","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.1127672,"longitude":-77.5625836,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:21:48","updateDate":"2017-04-04 17:53:04","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xpgL0V","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","streetAddress":"22455 Davis Dr, suite 120","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20164","phone":"571-375-2652","website":"crookedrunbrewing.com","latitude":38.9947623,"longitude":-77.4231583,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-03 20:00:27","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:29:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QCDLiJ","name":"Near & Dear","nameDisplay":"Near & Dear","abv":"8","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-16 18:13:24","updateDate":"2016-01-18 18:15:05","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
