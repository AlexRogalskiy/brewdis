The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"JKx7GQ","name":"Carolina Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Carolina","description":"Carolina Brewery is a locally-owned brewery and restaurant that has drawn international attention for its handcrafted beers, Our award-winning signature beers include Flagship IPA (Gold Medal, Great American Beer Festival), Copperline Amber Ale (Gold Medal, World Beer Championships), Sky Blue Golden Ale (Silver Medal, World Beer Championships), and Oatmeal Porter.

Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"pcrctk","name":"NoDa Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"NoDa","description":"NoDa Brewing Company opened its doors to the world on October 29, 2011 and is one of Charlotte\u2019s newest home-grown microbrewery for beer lovers in the Carolinas!

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.058","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"k2Fa8Z","name":"North Mountain Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"North Mountain","description":"Classic beer hall influence, full flavored unfiltered beer and beer food of the world inspired menu.
