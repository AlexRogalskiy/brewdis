The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JjE57s","name":"Nut Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Nut Brown Ale","description":"Our Nut Brown Ale exhibits a beautiful nut-like aroma.

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:13:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"UYOVWAHCBD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RW6Da0","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Laurel","region":"MD","postalCode":"20723","latitude":39.1426709,"longitude":-76.860565,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-03-14 17:43:05","updateDate":"2016-05-01 14:34:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7APpWR","name":"Nut Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Nut Brown Ale","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:47","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:44","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-09-03 12:33:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"12HYVPGOJF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Fegley's Allentown Brew Works","streetAddress":"812 W Hamilton St","locality":"Allentown","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18101","phone":"610.433.7777","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com\/allentown-brewworks\/","latitude":40.6013531,"longitude":-75.4739451,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"SAPoSh","name":"Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works","streetAddress":"569 Main Street","locality":"Bethlehem","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18018","phone":"610-882-1300","latitude":40.6222629,"longitude":-75.3821851,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"g5TIK9","name":"Nutter Brown","nameDisplay":"Nutter Brown","abv":"4.8","glasswareId":5,"availableId":3,"styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 21:53:49","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.
