There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"RxmG5e","name":"Modern Times Beer","nameShortDisplay":"Modern Times Beer","description":"We focus (non-monogamously) on aroma-driven, complex, flavorful, sessionish beers. We often brew hybrid styles, combining the features we like from established categories to create new, Island-Of-Doctor-Moreau-style mash-ups.\r\n\r\nFortunate Islands combines the mildly nutty malt body of a wheat beer with the intensely bright, citrusy hoppiness of a righteous IPA. Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches. We hope to release some our more successful experiments in cans and bottles in the coming years.","website":"http:\/\/moderntimesbeer.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-05 20:35:32","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:31:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"15J7L2HM86","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"P8CiOe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3725 Greenwood St.","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 546-9694","website":"http:\/\/DrinkModern.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  12:00pm -

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

The two men, whose passion for beer runs as deep as Superior, are the driving force behind Keweenaw Brewing Company.","website":"http:\/\/kbc.beer\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:05:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VFEYSX2AI8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"LZ4UuN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"408 Shelden Avenue","locality":"Houghton","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49931","phone":"906-482-5596","website":"http:\/\/www.keweenawbrewing.com\/","latitude":47.1218751,"longitude":-88.5688653,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sFzINW","name":"November IPA of the Month - \"NovAmber\"","nameDisplay":"November IPA of the Month - \"NovAmber\" (2014)","description":"In the blustery month that brings us Thanksgiving, you just might find yourself grateful for this delicious IPA of the Month edition.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"TvurmC","name":"Sweet Mullets Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Sweet Mullets","description":"Changed ownership in 2016 and renamed to Brewfinity Brewing Co. in 2017.","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TvurmC\/upload_cXyFCb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TvurmC\/upload_cXyFCb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TvurmC\/upload_cXyFCb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TvurmC\/upload_cXyFCb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TvurmC\/upload_cXyFCb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-12 01:13:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:21:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F913UL4SY6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Kt5IEV","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"N58W39800 Industrial Road","extendedAddress":"Unit D","locality":"Oconomowoc","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53066","latitude":43.125831,"longitude":-88.537339,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","yearClosed":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-12 01:14:29","updateDate":"2018-08-22 19:19:50","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"C2o8JP","name":"Novemberfest","nameDisplay":"Novemberfest","description":"Our traditional FestBier, released in September, although we always hope it lasts into November.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive. To stand out amongst this group, you need to push the envelope and be out there to get to your niche and magic elixir.","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:39:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KY5HWFDR7B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lijo4X","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97225","phone":"503-296-0110","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","latitude":45.485627,"longitude":-122.753996,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"DnQkrw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"939 SE Belmont","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","latitude":45.5166668,"longitude":-122.6560412,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-04 05:03:47","updateDate":"2015-07-07 13:30:30","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"A9Qomj","name":"Nozzle Nut","nameDisplay":"Nozzle Nut","abv":"5.2","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":70,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-20 17:05:08","updateDate":"2017-12-21 17:36:25","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":70,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","shortName":"Belgian Ale","description":"Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.

Although packaged within a medium often overlooked for its artistic merits, our desire is to offer something new and intriguing. We present more than just a fine crafted beverage, rather an occasion that evokes an emotion and inspires contemplation. For art is not a sum of actions but rather an approach to life. We draw our inspiration from the world around us, whether that be a season, location, or even humanity itself. Our intent is to encapsulate this muse exhibiting an artistic rendition to the best of our abilities.","website":"http:\/\/www.stillwaterales.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AfUn8b","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","website":"http:\/\/www.stillwaterales.com\/","latitude":39.290585,"longitude":-76.609264,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7xVP3t","name":"Nubian Overlord","nameDisplay":"Nubian Overlord","description":"A no-holds-barred double IPA brewed with Warrior and a blend of hops.","abv":"8.8","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7xVP3t\/upload_KqDKdF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7xVP3t\/upload_KqDKdF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7xVP3t\/upload_KqDKdF-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7xVP3t\/upload_KqDKdF-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7xVP3t\/upload_KqDKdF-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7xVP3t\/upload_KqDKdF-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-11 18:16:30","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:28:07","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.
