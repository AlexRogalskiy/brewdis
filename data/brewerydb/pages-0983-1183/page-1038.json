Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

We welcome you as our guests to stop by and try a glass of Peter's hard work.","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8gAMPa","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"500 Commercial Street","locality":"Manchester","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03101","phone":"603-625-4444","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","latitude":42.9940979,"longitude":-71.4672608,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2016-12-08 13:40:06","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zwmbVd","name":"Milo's Phoenix","nameDisplay":"Milo's Phoenix","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-11 14:59:03","updateDate":"2018-07-16 15:18:55","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

We were busy creating the same kind of crisp,refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events. Go Blazers!\r\n\r\nSome would say our legendary steak sandwiches and two dozen rotating taps are a match made in heaven.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"yfDPgj","name":"Indiana City Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Indiana City","description":"It\u2019s our mission to brew innovative beers for craft beer lovers in Indy.

Brewer may indicate on the bottle whether the yeast should be intentionally roused or if they prefer that the entry be poured as quietly as possible.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:43:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"W0G7sk","name":"Spring House Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Spring House","description":"Located in Conestoga, PA in the heart of Lancaster County.","website":"http:\/\/www.springhousebeer.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W0G7sk\/upload_bvG0Oh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W0G7sk\/upload_bvG0Oh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W0G7sk\/upload_bvG0Oh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W0G7sk\/upload_bvG0Oh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W0G7sk\/upload_bvG0Oh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:31:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"23TOYA1PKX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"RwaR3B","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 Hazel St","locality":"Lancaster","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17603","phone":"7179842530","website":"http:\/\/www.springhousebeer.com\/","latitude":40.0299714,"longitude":-76.3083551,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2019-06-10 19:48:22","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:30am-10:00pm,tue-11:30am-10:00pm,wed-11:30am-10:00pm,thu-11:30am-10:00pm,fri-11:30am-12:00am,sat-11:30am-12:00am,sun-11:30am-9:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"yQQSln","name":"Taproom","streetAddress":"25 West King Street","locality":"Lancaster","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17603","phone":"(717) 399-4009","website":"http:\/\/www.springhousebeer.com\/","latitude":40.0382865,"longitude":-76.3069595,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-03 21:13:34","updateDate":"2017-08-01 18:23:13","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qBtZUd","name":"Mind Drive","nameDisplay":"Mind Drive","description":"Like it's little brother Tribal Rite, Mind Drive is dark black with a thick, khaki-colored head.
