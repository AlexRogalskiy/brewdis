There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"}},{"id":"uxfIAj","name":"Not Your Father's Ginger Ale","nameDisplay":"Not Your Father's Ginger Ale","description":"We like to think of it as a refreshing ale brewed with ginger.","abv":"5.9","styleId":161,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/uxfIAj\/upload_wR5h0a-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/uxfIAj\/upload_wR5h0a-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/uxfIAj\/upload_wR5h0a-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/uxfIAj\/upload_wR5h0a-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/uxfIAj\/upload_wR5h0a-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/uxfIAj\/upload_wR5h0a-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2015-11-10 15:02:14","updateDate":"2016-04-15 19:34:11","style":{"id":161,"categoryId":14,"category":{"id":14,"name":"Malternative Beverages","description":"Malternative Beverages, also known as \"ready-to-drink\" beverages, are sweet, sometime carbonated, beverages that are low in alcohol.","createDate":"2014-07-10 14:11:26","updateDate":"2014-07-10 14:20:24"},"name":"Flavored Malt Beverage","shortName":"Flavored Malt Beverage","description":"Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that are different from traditional malt beverages like malt liquor, ales, and lagers in several aspects.
