Beechwood smoked malt contributes an upfront roastiness while charred manzanita branches add hints of perfume and a slightly tannic woody finish.\r\n\r\nManzanita is an imaginative take on the classic German rauchbier, combining traditional ingredients with inspiration from the Northern California wilderness. An assertive, multi-layered smoke aroma -- courtesy of beechwood-smoked malts and charred manzanita branches -- gives way to a light-bodied structure and a surprisingly delicate balance of flavors: nutty, herbal, sweet and savory. A beer for a campfire on a crisp fall night.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"16","styleId":55,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yVcyJ9\/upload_ALxhFi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yVcyJ9\/upload_ALxhFi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yVcyJ9\/upload_ALxhFi-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yVcyJ9\/upload_ALxhFi-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yVcyJ9\/upload_ALxhFi-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yVcyJ9\/upload_ALxhFi-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-11 21:27:25","updateDate":"2017-10-24 13:44:27","style":{"id":55,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Altbier","shortName":"Altbier","description":"German-Style Altbiers are copper to dark brown ales, originally from the D\u00fcsseldorf area.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
