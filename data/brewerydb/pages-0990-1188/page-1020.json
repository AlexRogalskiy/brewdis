This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"}},{"id":"B5TwAS","name":"Mellert Export","nameDisplay":"Mellert Export","abv":"5.1","styleId":79,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 11:57:11","updateDate":"2015-04-14 15:07:03","style":{"id":79,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Dortmunder \/ European-Style Export","shortName":"Dortmunder","description":"Dortmunder has medium hop bitterness.

There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"}},{"id":"ufmet6","name":"Melon Baller","nameDisplay":"Melon Baller","abv":"7.2","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-01 13:04:03","updateDate":"2015-06-01 13:04:03","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"}},{"id":"0Bswi4","name":"Melons On A Blonde","nameDisplay":"Melons On A Blonde","description":"Featuring a juicy new hop variety from Germany called \u201cMelon\u201d we designed this blonde ale to be a sessionable, citrus delight.","abv":"5.5","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-04 15:34:39","updateDate":"2014-09-07 14:45:33","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
