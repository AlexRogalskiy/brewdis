Frothy white head with huge cavernous bubbles.\r\n\r\nSmell: There are heavy lemon and copper aromas in here. Once these subside, it smells like generic bready malts.\r\n\r\nFlavor: It\u2019s surprisingly sweet and tastes like pancakes. There is also a prevalent alcohol note, which is rather inappropriate as its ABV is not actually that high.\r\n\r\nFeel: Medium body with a prickly carbonation.\r\n\r\nConcluding Remark:  Overall, Erdinger\u2019s Oktoberfest is pretty lackluster. While not unpleasant, it\u2019s nothing to celebrate while wearing a dirndl. I should mention, though, that Erdinger\u2019s fest beer is actually a Hefeweizen, not a M\u00e4rzen. I have found that some breweries stick an Oktoberfest-themed label on their flagship products in order to spruce them up for the holiday season. In Erdinger\u2019s case, the brewery added a little flair to their Weissbier, and from the taste of it, added a small dose of Munich malts. It has a little more flavor and color than the Weiss. However, don\u2019t make the mistake I did and purchase this thinking you were going to further your understanding of Oktoberfestbiers.","abv":"5.7","glasswareId":3,"availableId":4,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xr0G6p\/upload_KO8PXZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xr0G6p\/upload_KO8PXZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xr0G6p\/upload_KO8PXZ-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xr0G6p\/upload_KO8PXZ-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xr0G6p\/upload_KO8PXZ-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xr0G6p\/upload_KO8PXZ-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:50","updateDate":"2015-12-15 20:42:06","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.
