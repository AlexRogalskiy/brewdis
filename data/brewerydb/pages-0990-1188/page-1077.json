Will is one of the most experienced brewers of the United States and his beers are unanimously recognised for their subtlety.\r\nThe base of this beer is a Brown Ale, aged for 10 months in oak barrels, in which it fermented for a second time with Brettanomyces yeasts. It is inspired by the English beers of the past. Its body is dark copper with ruby reflections. Its nose develops flavours of red fruits (alcohol preserved cherries) and notes of malt (biscuit, brown candied sugar, caramel, and roasted hazelnuts).

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"}},{"id":"SEdSo1","name":"Narrowback","nameDisplay":"Narrowback","abv":"4.7","ibu":"0","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-16 21:31:46","updateDate":"2016-11-18 19:58:46","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

National Bohemian, or Natty Boh is Baltimore's signature beer and a legend among American beers.\r\n\r\nA Bohemian-style beer, Natty Boh was first brewed in 1885 by the National Brewing Company in Baltimore, Maryland. After prohibition, National Bohemian returned with the introduction of Mr. Boh, the one-eyed mascot with a handlebar-mustache and distinctive smile. Instantly adopted as a symbol of a proud city, Mr. Boh continues to be the iconic face for the brand today appearing on all cans, bottles, packaging and merchandise found in shops all over Maryland.\r\n\r\nIn the late '40s, canned beer started becoming popular and National was the first brewer in the U.S. to put six-packs of cans on the market. In following decade, National Brewing continued to proudly represent Baltimore and the Maryland shore, adopting the now famous slogan: \"From the Land of Pleasant Living\". In 1965, National Bohemian became the official sponsor of the Baltimore Orioles. Natty Boh was served at Memorial Stadium and cemented its reputation as \"official\" beer of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nToday, Natty Boh has returned to the traditional recipe that made it the beer of choice in Baltimore and across the mid-Atlantic. Likewise, Mr. Boh continues to be a symbol of the community he so proudly represents and can be seen keeping watch over the city on top of the Natty Boh Tower. But he represents far more than a simple mascot, he is also the uncrowned king of Baltimore and plays a significant role in what makes Baltimore different from any other city in the world!","abv":"4.28","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_ap3bcc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_ap3bcc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_ap3bcc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_ap3bcc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_ap3bcc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_ap3bcc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-01 12:24:19","updateDate":"2018-06-11 18:56:13","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"}},{"id":"2ccb2S","name":"NatteLore Hors Saison","nameDisplay":"NatteLore Hors Saison","abv":"9.1","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2ccb2S\/upload_sO6dzj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2ccb2S\/upload_sO6dzj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2ccb2S\/upload_sO6dzj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2ccb2S\/upload_sO6dzj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2ccb2S\/upload_sO6dzj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2ccb2S\/upload_sO6dzj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-02 19:48:32","updateDate":"2015-12-18 04:18:44","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
