It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"}},{"id":"tk5VA6","name":"Monkey Paw Howler IPA","nameDisplay":"Monkey Paw Howler IPA","description":"Bright, clean, citrus, floral, tropical, dry\u2026 everything a san diego-style ipa should be. with a liberal addition of centennial and meridian hops, you get a good note of orange and pine. the malt takes a back seat in this beer, and really leaves the hops to be the star. an easy to drink, fantastic ipa for every day drinking.","abv":"6.6","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tk5VA6\/upload_AUkI1p-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tk5VA6\/upload_AUkI1p-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tk5VA6\/upload_AUkI1p-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tk5VA6\/upload_AUkI1p-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tk5VA6\/upload_AUkI1p-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tk5VA6\/upload_AUkI1p-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-30 22:59:04","updateDate":"2015-12-17 02:44:29","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Bitterness should be moderately high to very high and balanced with full sweet malt character. Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:49"}},{"id":"xMFXxE","name":"mono.tone.cascade","nameDisplay":"mono.tone.cascade","description":"mono.tone will be a series of beers that will explore a single hop variety and constantly change each time it is brewed.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"}},{"id":"MweezS","name":"Monocle","nameDisplay":"Monocle","abv":"4","ibu":"36","styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-16 00:00:38","updateDate":"2015-04-16 00:00:38","style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.
