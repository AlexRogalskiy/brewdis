This extended cold conditioning helps these beers to be very smooth and crisp for the fall season.\r\n\r\nTrue to tradition, Sebago Brewing Company's Octoberfest was brewed in March of 2011 and spent the summer months conditioning at a chilly 33F until September, which helped harmonize the malt flavors and gentle hop character of this lager. It was fermented at lower temperatures with a lager strain of yeast we do not typically use.\r\n\r\nOctoberfest is unfiltered and may have a slight haze to its amber color which disappears as the beer warms slightly. Its bready aroma is followed by a subtle grain and toffee flavor with a medium body that finishes crisply.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
