If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Ambers can range dramatically in bitterness and alcohol volume and even in color. That makes for a very broad palette for a brewer.\r\n\r\n My goal with our amber was to capture a beautiful reddish hue that reflected the copper that this city is famous (or perhaps infamous) for. I also wanted to create a flavor profile that challenged people with hints of that transition from a pale ale into a porter. So, our amber features a strong 2 row backing with plenty of roasted malts giving not only that beautiful color but the toffee and caramel flavor that suggests that there's a porter in there just begging to get out.\r\n\r\n All we needed was a name to bring the amber home. We struggled for some time, taking suggestions from the owners, friends and of course the young lady who recommended we build the amber in the first place. Ultimately, as it so often does, the name presented itself. We were struck. We couldn't come up with a name and we had a beer ready to go. Somebody in a meeting mentioned that we were \"Up the crick\" if we couldn't put together a decent name.\r\n\r\n \"No Paddle\" was born.\r\n\r\n We hope you enjoy our amber.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"35","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-17 00:27:13","updateDate":"2015-09-17 00:27:13","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
