This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"}},{"id":"E46HQU","name":"Might as Well","nameDisplay":"Might as Well","description":"While debating whether it was appropriate to include an IPL (India Pale Lager) in our Custom IPA Series, our team collectively agreed that we \u201cMight AsWell.\u201d  Our IPA-Style Lager is brewed like an IPA, hopped like an IPA, but fermented with lager yeast for a clean, light malt profile that highlights the bold passion fruit and pear contributed by Galaxy and Calypso hops.","abv":"7.2","availableId":4,"styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E46HQU\/upload_OAiPgt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E46HQU\/upload_OAiPgt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E46HQU\/upload_OAiPgt-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E46HQU\/upload_OAiPgt-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E46HQU\/upload_OAiPgt-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E46HQU\/upload_OAiPgt-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-25 13:22:16","updateDate":"2015-12-17 14:53:09","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"}},{"id":"w3Qg21","name":"Mike's Camaro","nameDisplay":"Mike's Camaro","abv":"6","styleId":110,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w3Qg21\/upload_V5A00T-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-25 15:20:40","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:00:14","style":{"id":110,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"California Common Beer","shortName":"California Common","description":"California Common Beer is light amber to amber in color and is medium bodied.
