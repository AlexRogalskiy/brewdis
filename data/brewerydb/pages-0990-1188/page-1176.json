Pacific Schwarzbock is true to German-style bocks, with an alcohol content of 8%, yet remarkably drinkable with no alcohol taste but a nice warm body that beer connoisseurs are looking for.\r\n\r\nPacific Schwarzbock is brewed with just enough black malts to give the beer its deep black color without tasting burned. In fact, to the contrary, Pacific Schwarzbock has a nice velvety body with lots of warm mouth feel. The black malts come through just enough to provide a subtle hint of coffee notes.","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":84,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Q6madu\/upload_TWabUe-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-31 13:06:40","updateDate":"2015-12-16 17:54:24","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":84,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","shortName":"Schwarzbier","description":"These very dark brown to black beers have a mild roasted malt character without the associated bitterness.
