The beautiful copper color reflects the caramel and pilsner malt in this seasonal brew. M\u00e4rzen, also known as an Oktoberfest-style beer, originated for the celebration of King Ludwig I wedding in 1810 and has been a Bavaria tradition ever since. The M\u00e4rzen\/Oktoberfest style beer which is served during the celebration is often brewed in the spring and held cold over the summer to be tapped in spectacular fashion at the beginning of Oktoberfest in Munich.
