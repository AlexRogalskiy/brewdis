Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

The stout developed over years of trial and error until the perfect storm came together to create the right texture and flavor profile.\r\n\r\n Muddy Creek is pleasant not only for its flavor but for its fullness and complexity. Generally a \"chocolate stout\" is so named for it's color, not specifically for any particular flavor profiles. In fact, stouts are more notable for strong coffee or roasted barley flavors than anything else. However, in the case of Muddy Creek, we have actually made efforts to incorporate chocolate flavors into the recipe which enhance the aroma, flavor and natural bitterness of the stout. These flavors mix naturally with the coffee undercurrent of the stout to form a nice blend. Add the silky mouth-feel from the oats and you have a very unique experience.\r\n\r\n We were so happy with how Muddy Creek turned out as a beer that we named the brewery after it. We hope you'll like it too. We currently serve our stout on both CO2 and on Nitro.
