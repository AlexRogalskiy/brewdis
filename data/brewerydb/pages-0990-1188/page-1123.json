English and Scottish breweries often made sweeter stouts than their Irish cousins and oatmeal stouts are a lot different from the classic dry Irish stouts like our Cobblestone. Oatmeal stouts are sweeter from the additional malts used (including caramel malt) and have a very silky texture from the small quantity of oats used in the mash. Our version is slightly drier than typical of this style but we make up for it by accentuating the apparent sweetness and smoothness of the beer by Nitrogen-charging it.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"20","styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-19 13:40:26","updateDate":"2017-12-19 13:40:26","style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.
