The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Like the history of brewing in Philadelphia the name Philadelphia Brewing Company has gone through many revivals. The same can be said of our brewery building - the former Wiesbrod and Hess Brewing Company complex in Kensington. At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!","website":"http:\/\/philadelphiabrewing.com","established":"1885","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:20:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HP3G6DVQRW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"I9iOxV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2423 Amber St","locality":"Philadelphia","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19125","phone":"215-427-BREW (2739)","website":"http:\/\/philadelphiabrewing.com\/index.htm","latitude":39.982733,"longitude":-75.127469,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HdAdqv","name":"Walter","nameDisplay":"Walter","description":"In the beginning Walter believed that his journey was righteous, he needed the money for his medical bills and to protect his family.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness. We are active in the community through volunteer work and partnerships with local charities.","website":"http:\/\/www.pinestreetbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:55:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6LORC8NJKE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"EhUsAz","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94108","phone":"415-744-4062","latitude":37.79179,"longitude":-122.407419,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kDszcy","name":"Walter Blonde Ale","nameDisplay":"Walter Blonde Ale","description":"Walter is an American Blonde Ale with a bready, malty aroma. \u201cHe\u201d (as we call this beer) has a light to medium body and is yellow to gold in color.

Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze.
