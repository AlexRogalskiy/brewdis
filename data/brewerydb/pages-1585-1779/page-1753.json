There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"pHs1Yo","name":"River North Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"River North","description":"Independent family-owned Denver brewery crafting Adventure Fuel for the state of Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/www.rivernorthbrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-08 21:12:33","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:05:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CG6TLSE8DO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"9pFgAc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2401 Blake St #1","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80205","phone":"303.296.2617","latitude":39.7586165,"longitude":-104.9892608,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-07-08 21:13:45","updateDate":"2016-10-07 00:16:27","forwardingId":"R0qhwx","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"R0qhwx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6021 Washington St","extendedAddress":"Unit A.","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80216","phone":"(303) 296-2617","website":"http:\/\/www.rivernorthbrewery.com\/","latitude":39.8065586,"longitude":-104.9790984,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-02 23:08:33","updateDate":"2016-10-07 00:16:13","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"42BlCD","name":"Wine Barrel Noir","nameDisplay":"Wine Barrel Noir","description":"Wine Barrel Noir is our imperial oatmeal stout aged in freshly dumped red wine barrels.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

This eagerness to ask ourselves \u201cwhat if?\u201d has earned us a slew of accolades, a shelf full of awards and devoted customers who are always eager to try what CBC comes up with next.","website":"https:\/\/www.cambridgebrewingcompany.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2019-07-11 17:56:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HLIPT1ZMKW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EB3XVT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Kendall Square","extendedAddress":"Bldg 100","locality":"Cambridge","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02139","phone":"(617) 494-1994","website":"http:\/\/www.cambrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri: 11:30 am - 1:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":42.366468,"longitude":-71.0914549,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri: 11:30 am - 1:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"iyO3bV","name":"Wini Witi","nameDisplay":"Wini Witi","abv":"4.4","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iyO3bV\/upload_iXSY9U-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iyO3bV\/upload_iXSY9U-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iyO3bV\/upload_iXSY9U-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iyO3bV\/upload_iXSY9U-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iyO3bV\/upload_iXSY9U-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iyO3bV\/upload_iXSY9U-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-04 12:38:56","updateDate":"2015-12-16 22:03:59","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

It boasted a post office and later a school, which remains today. St Elmo Brewing Company was started in 2016 by two dudes that love beer. They love sharing it, drinking it, and most of all, making it. \r\n\r\nSt Elmo was started by Tim Bullock and Bryan Winslow. We aren\u2019t beer bigots, we like ALL the beer. Every style of beer has it\u2019s special place in life.  St Elmo is our effort to take you to all of those in places, in your mouth. \r\n\r\nWe chose the name St. Elmo for a very important reason. Our location. We are very excited to grow and be a part of The Yard and the St. Elmo neighborhood. With tons of great neighbors like Music Lab, South Austin Brewery, Still Austin, Spokesman, and Juiceland, we hope to bring the heat to an already creative block.  \r\n\r\nAt St Elmo, we\u2019re excited to engage with our neighbors and break down barriers between brewer and drinker. Our brewhouse is open to the bar for a reason. \r\n\r\nOur bar, beer hall, and beer garden are great places to spend your day. We\u2019re open six days a week. And great beer isn\u2019t the only option. We also have pour-over coffee, housemade mineral water, and soda. And food! Our resident food truck, Soursop, serves amazing Asian drinking food: we\u2019re talking fatty pork, thai chicken wings, La Koreanita burger, etc.\r\n\r\nA clean, refreshing Kolsch is hard to beat in the Texas heat.  Pale Ale that explodes with zest and fruit is a fantastic way to relax with friends. We love a funky Saison on a cool spring evening.  What we\u2019re getting at is, we love all the beer!\r\n\r\nCome ask us a question and help us make better beer!

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
