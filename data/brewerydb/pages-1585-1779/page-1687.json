Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xr2YWB","name":"Vanilla IPA","nameDisplay":"Vanilla IPA","description":"Our traditional Initial Point IPA with a twist.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"02Ne4w","name":"Iron Hill Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Iron Hill","description":"Welcome to Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, where you'll find fine handcrafted beers, creative yet informal cuisine, and friendly, attentive service in a casual, upscale atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe're passionate about producing distinctive, full-flavored handcrafted beers, accompanied by fresh\u2013from\u2013scratch New American cuisine in a comfortable, casual atmosphere.

The experience is unlike any other you can find in beer.","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:41:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"622Y3A","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"223 North Main","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74107","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","latitude":36.159253,"longitude":-95.9937507,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:42:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:09","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IwMl7T","name":"Prairie Artisan Ales Taproom","streetAddress":"3 NE 8th St.","locality":"Oklahoma City","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"73104","phone":"(405) 602-0894","website":"https:\/\/prairieales.com\/okc-taproom\/","latitude":35.4763325,"longitude":-97.5117798,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:50:43","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-11:00am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rtGEBZ","name":"Vanilla Nut Smasher","nameDisplay":"Vanilla Nut Smasher","abv":"11","styleId":44,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-11 15:00:05","updateDate":"2018-06-11 17:53:28","style":{"id":44,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Specialty Stouts","shortName":"Stout","description":"See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.

They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2019-07-22 17:20:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SZ1UAXE94G","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"eOm6Xk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"500 Linden Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"1-970-221-0524","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","latitude":40.593415,"longitude":-105.066874,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:48:39","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"m1a0ra","name":"Asheville","streetAddress":"155 Craven Street","locality":"Asheville","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28806","latitude":35.588358,"longitude":-82.573548,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-06 12:29:33","updateDate":"2016-05-09 20:38:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wRXFQG","name":"Vanilla Porter","nameDisplay":"Vanilla Porter","description":"Pure vanilla paired with our Custom Porter perfectly balances sweetness and bitterness.

In 2015, the dream of owning a Brewery & Pub came to life with the opening of Schnitz Brewery & Pub.\r\n\r\nAfter the former Jasper Country Club was purchased by the Hanselman family in 2013, work immediately began as crews gutted the upper and lower levels of the building. The top level was turned into an event center called KlubHaus 61. The lower level, formally the Country Club pro shop, locker rooms, and bar, began the transformation process in 2014. A floor plan was drawn up and the brewery & pub quickly started to take shape. For the brewery itself, a room offering viewing windows and accommodating all of the necessary brewing equipment was created. All new equipment arrived and was placed in the space. The bar from the original Country Club was preserved. A family dining area was also constructed. Quickly, the Schnitz Brewery & Pub took shape and evolved into a welcoming space with a warm but yet industrial feel.\r\n\r\nWe are sure you will love the unique atmosphere and also the outdoor patio seating in a beautiful park like surrounding!","website":"http:\/\/www.schnitzbrewery.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uG4KlW\/upload_HZEOu9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uG4KlW\/upload_HZEOu9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uG4KlW\/upload_HZEOu9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uG4KlW\/upload_HZEOu9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uG4KlW\/upload_HZEOu9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-10 13:50:04","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:19:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RB618WA9V0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Wlif0F","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2031 Newton Street Suite B","locality":"Jasper","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47532","phone":"812.848.2739","website":"http:\/\/www.schnitzbrewery.com\/","latitude":38.4060274,"longitude":-86.9376427,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-10 13:52:03","updateDate":"2016-10-10 13:52:03","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-4:00pm-9:00pm,wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-4:00pm-10:00pm,sun-4:00pm-8:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Dbxjqk","name":"Vanilla Porter","nameDisplay":"Vanilla Porter","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":19,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-07 18:05:44","updateDate":"2015-06-11 20:14:46","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":19,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Robust Porter","shortName":"Robust Porter","description":"Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"GpPbOw","name":"Latitude 33 Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Latitude 33","description":"Regardless of the people and events, however, Latitude 33 is always synonymous with \u201cAdventure\u201d \u2014 which is also our brewing philosophy.
