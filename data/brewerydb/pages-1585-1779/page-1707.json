Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

The company purchased an acre and a half of land at 800 44th Avenue North, and went to work on the future of the brewery. Shortly after celebrating 4 years of business, the move from the East side to the West side began. From roughly 5000 square feet, to a brand new, state of the art, 33,000 square foot facility. When asked what the vision was for the project, Ben answered with one word, \u201cQuality\u201d.
