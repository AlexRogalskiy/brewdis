Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:20:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q8W2M631AI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hFlioG","name":"Wheat Wine","nameDisplay":"Wheat Wine","description":"We took our Bavarian Weizen and brewed it to Barley Wine strength.

Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success. Customers can always find a beer that meets their drinking style.","website":"http:\/\/www.corcoranbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"G7WXOq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"205 Hirst Rd, Suite 105","locality":"Purcellville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20132","phone":"540-441-3102","website":"http:\/\/www.corcoranbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00am - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":39.143536,"longitude":-77.712861,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-06-09 18:47:13","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00am - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yjkSJY","name":"Wheatland Wheat","nameDisplay":"Wheatland Wheat","description":"True Hefeweizen yeast and malted wheat give this ale its authentic German flavor and aroma.

West Virginian Brian Cox and newly transplanted Massachusetts resident Joe Ploof met as graduates of the American Brewers Guild during graduation week in Sacramento, CA in the summer of 2012. Both had recently decided to leave cushy yet banal careers for the promise of low paying, back breaking careers in beer. Their brash personalities and drinking proclivities made for an immediate friendship.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation week ended, Brian moved to Louisville to take a job as assistant brewer with Bluegrass Brewing and Joe went back to Massachusetts to become the assistant brewer for Back East Brewing. One year later, after heeding some timely advice from Joe\u2019s wife, Joe and Brian decided to take their dream brewery seriously.  After a few weeks of discussion over its final location, Brian boldly packed a U-Haul truck, moved to Connecticut and accepted a job as the head brewer of a then unopened facility.\r\n\r\nScott Stauffer, an insurance careerist, who once harbored dreams of resurrecting a long dead Pennsylvania brand, hit on a tip from a friend and met Joe and Brian over beers at the Hartford drinking institution The Spigot. Although Brian and Joe did not bring any of their own beer, Scott gleaned two things: that Joe and Brian were nuts for good beer and that they wanted to brew it in Hartford.  Most importantly for a reasonable fellow like Scott, he realized their skeleton of a business plan had some good bones.\r\n\r\nTwo years after that meeting, they\u2019ve thrown themselves into the Hanging Hills Brewing Company project with everything they\u2019ve got.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.

Perceived impression of bitterness is soft and well-integrated into overall balance, and may differ significantly from measured or calculated IBU levels.\r\n\r\nFermentation Characteristics: Low to medium fruity-estery aroma and \ufb02avor may be present, but are usually overwhelmed by hop character. Diacetyl should not be perceived.\r\n\r\nBody: Medium to high. Perceived silky or full mouthfeel may contribute to overall flavor profile.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes: Grist may include a small amount of oat, wheat or other adjuncts to promote haziness.
