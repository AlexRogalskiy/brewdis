In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nUT6v5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2072 Stoneman Circle","locality":"Lakewood","region":"New York","postalCode":"14750","phone":"716-763-5479","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1008305,"longitude":-79.3356897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-27 14:23:02","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OJrSkt","name":"Southern Tier Brewing Company-Pittsburgh","streetAddress":"316 N Shore Dr.","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15212","phone":"(412) 301-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.stbcbeer.com\/capabilities-view\/about-stbc-pittsburgh\/","latitude":40.4463787,"longitude":-80.0104128,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-09 00:10:10","updateDate":"2018-04-10 14:11:48","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wL3m5z","name":"Tiffany","nameDisplay":"Tiffany","abv":"5.5","ibu":"28","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-20 16:28:10","updateDate":"2016-05-20 16:28:10","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"oLu2vX","name":"Chakra Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Chakra","website":"http:\/\/chakrabeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"s7vM0W","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"122 New Jawahar Nagar","locality":"Jalandhar","region":"Punjab","phone":"+4798002825","website":"http:\/\/chakrabeer.com\/","latitude":31.33421,"longitude":75.57769,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IN","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IN","name":"INDIA","displayName":"India","isoThree":"IND","numberCode":356,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Aj4GG0","name":"Tiger Paw Porter","nameDisplay":"Tiger Paw Porter","description":"A dark, deep brown with ruby highlights, coffee flavor up front followed by a chocolate finish, low hop aroma, and low bitterness.","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:23","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:43:34","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a top fermented beer which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with Dubbel and Tripel in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced Blond. Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called Enkel.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Historically, traditional gueuze lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.
