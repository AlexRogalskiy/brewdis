Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8zqQaN","name":"The Wizard of Remich Park","nameDisplay":"The Wizard of Remich Park","description":"Brewed with coconut!","abv":"8.6","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-04-19 14:25:47","updateDate":"2019-04-19 14:25:47","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"r5kixF","name":"Cisco Brewers","nameShortDisplay":"Cisco Brewers","website":"http:\/\/www.ciscobrewers.com\/","established":"1992","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r5kixF\/upload_0I4zge-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r5kixF\/upload_0I4zge-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r5kixF\/upload_0I4zge-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r5kixF\/upload_0I4zge-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r5kixF\/upload_0I4zge-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:16:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"V4XASFYWQ5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"B2A0Gi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5 Bartlett Farm Road","locality":"Nantucket","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02584","phone":"508-325-5929","website":"http:\/\/www.ciscobrewers.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat:10:00 am - 7:00 pm\r\nSun:12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":41.263609,"longitude":-70.131438,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-10:00am-7:00pm,tue-10:00am-7:00pm,wed-10:00am-7:00pm,thu-10:00am-7:00pm,fri-10:00am-7:00pm,sat-10:00am-7:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sat:10:00 am - 7:00 pm\r\nSun:12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"98mgk2","name":"The Woods - Pechish Woods","nameDisplay":"The Woods - Pechish Woods","description":"ale aged in oak barrels with peaches added","abv":"4.88","glasswareId":10,"styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/98mgk2\/upload_BdfbFv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/98mgk2\/upload_BdfbFv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/98mgk2\/upload_BdfbFv-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/98mgk2\/upload_BdfbFv-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/98mgk2\/upload_BdfbFv-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/98mgk2\/upload_BdfbFv-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:22","updateDate":"2015-12-16 08:56:58","glass":{"id":10,"name":"Oversized Wine Glass","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"m4ZGnD","name":"There Can Only Be One Coffee IPA","nameDisplay":"There Can Only Be One Coffee IPA","description":"Is it an IPA?

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
