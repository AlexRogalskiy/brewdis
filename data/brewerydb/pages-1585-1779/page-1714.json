Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Both Wayne and Mark were avid homebrewers for many years. Mark continued on with his brewing education by completing the Web-based Concise Course in Brewing Technology at the Siebel Institute of Technology World Brewing Acadamy from which he obtained his Certificate.   We selected our location nestled in the heart of the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of upstate New York for its close proximity to Keuka Lake and the availability for lake water for brewing. Our building offered a spacious workable layout, ample parking and room for future expansion. We began our building renovations and equipment installation in early 2010,  received our license in the fall of 2010, and on November 11th, 2010 opened our doors for tours, tastings, and growler fills. \r\n\r\nOur Brew Room features a matched Ripley 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Brewing system. The Brew House includes a Boil Kettle, Mash Tun and Hot Liquor Tank. The Brew Room also features 3 double wall digital temperature controlled fermentation tanks, grain mill, filter, and other assorted brewing equipment. Adjacent to the brew room is a walk-in cooler containing 8 - 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Serving Tanks and assorted keg filling and dispensing equipment. \r\n\r\nThe entrance way and tasting room offer large windows for great views of the Brew Room  as well as a large comfortable area for you and your friends to relax and visit while enjoying your favorite brews offered fresh daily. We offer tastings and growler fills of fine crafted ales and root beer all brewed on premises as well as guided tours on non-brewing days. Have your own growlers, we fill your clean growlers. Don't own one yet, no worries we have 1 and 2 liter in several styles with our logo on them.","website":"http:\/\/www.fingerlakesbeercompany.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:51:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DFBWTOUNMS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kKNkdr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8462 St Rt 54","locality":"Hammondsport","region":"New York","postalCode":"14840","phone":"607-569-3311","website":"http:\/\/www.fingerlakesbeercompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday 12:00 - 5:00                                         Monday 12:00-6:00                                    Tuesday       CLOSED                                  Wednesday 12:00-6:00                                       Thursday 12:00-6:00                                            Friday 12:00-6:00                                             Saturday 12:00-6:00","latitude":42.400165,"longitude":-77.224988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday 12:00 - 5:00                                         Monday 12:00-6:00                                    Tuesday       CLOSED                                  Wednesday 12:00-6:00                                       Thursday 12:00-6:00                                            Friday 12:00-6:00                                             Saturday 12:00-6:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Skt7Ji","name":"Watermelon Wheat","nameDisplay":"Watermelon Wheat","abv":"5.6","glasswareId":5,"styleId":114,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Skt7Ji\/upload_Ot8I3A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Skt7Ji\/upload_Ot8I3A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Skt7Ji\/upload_Ot8I3A-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Skt7Ji\/upload_Ot8I3A-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Skt7Ji\/upload_Ot8I3A-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Skt7Ji\/upload_Ot8I3A-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-26 11:44:22","updateDate":"2015-12-17 11:38:56","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":114,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Wheat Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Fruit Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

We dry hopped this Extra Pale Ale with the same amount of hops used in our double IPA, leaving it with a massive tropical nose. Aroma starts with tropical fruits of guava, pineapple and mango, then continues with citrus notes of grapefruit, tangerine, and lime. Fresh from the tap, you will find it painfully drinkable and refreshing, whether it is your first pint or your third.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"eu1cAn","name":"Bull City Burger and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Bull City Burger","description":"Bull City Burger and Brewery is a locally owned, independent restaurant located at 107 East Parrish Street in downtown Durham, NC. We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3KlCGD","name":"Watts Wheat Wine","nameDisplay":"Watts Wheat Wine","description":"Our Anniversary Beer is a flavor-packed and complex Wheat Wine with notes of orange, honey and peppercorn.","abv":"8.4","ibu":"15","glasswareId":2,"srmId":12,"availableId":6,"styleId":35,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.075","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:11:15","updateDate":"2015-06-10 19:55:16","glass":{"id":2,"name":"Goblet","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":12,"name":"12","hex":"CF6900"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":35,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Wheat Wine Ale","shortName":"Wheatwine","description":"American style wheat wines range from gold to deep amber and are brewed with 50% or more wheat malt.
