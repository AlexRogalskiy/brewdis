The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:22:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5NJLHA2D94","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"L8Tr08","name":"Unfiltered Opinion","nameDisplay":"Unfiltered Opinion","description":"Unfiltered IPA dry-hopped with Simcoe and Mosaic.","abv":"6.1","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/L8Tr08\/upload_1HHf92-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/L8Tr08\/upload_1HHf92-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/L8Tr08\/upload_1HHf92-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/L8Tr08\/upload_1HHf92-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/L8Tr08\/upload_1HHf92-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/L8Tr08\/upload_1HHf92-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-25 16:26:33","updateDate":"2018-06-25 16:27:03","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. Head retention may not be optimal. The brewer must indicate the classic style on which the entry is based to allow for accurate judging. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during evaluation.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"t2vl8N","name":"Bayer Theinheim","nameShortDisplay":"Bayer Theinheim","website":"http:\/\/www.bayer-theinheim.de\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t2vl8N\/upload_Pv5UPx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t2vl8N\/upload_Pv5UPx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t2vl8N\/upload_Pv5UPx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t2vl8N\/upload_Pv5UPx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t2vl8N\/upload_Pv5UPx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-28 02:56:20","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Eu8QY2","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"Schulterbachstra\u00dfe 15","locality":"Rauhenebrach","postalCode":"96181","latitude":49.8847816,"longitude":10.5867465,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-28 12:13:16","updateDate":"2017-08-28 16:07:10","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7Fb3NB","name":"Unglued Caramel Apple","nameDisplay":"Unglued Caramel Apple","description":"This flavor brings back memories of those caramel apples from the county fair.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor from yeast can be typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clovelike characteristics should not be perceived. Body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Brewer may indicate on the bottle whether the yeast should be intentionally roused or if they prefer that the entry be poured as quietly as possible.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:43:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"uGY7WE","name":"Artifex Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Artifex","description":"Micro Brewery and Tasting room located in San Clemente, CA","website":"http:\/\/www.artifexbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"artifex@artifexbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uGY7WE\/upload_91z0kG-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 18:10:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:09:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"NVSXGQBJTM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1UJAd1","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"919 Calle Amanecer","extendedAddress":"Suite A","locality":"San Clemente","region":"California","phone":"949-429-7805","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nMon:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nTue:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nWed:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm","latitude":33.4493503,"longitude":-117.605586,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 18:02:11","updateDate":"2016-04-29 18:04:35","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nMon:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nTue:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nWed:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kJrOVv","name":"Unicorn Killer","nameDisplay":"Unicorn Killer","abv":"6.3","styleId":121,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-23 04:10:38","updateDate":"2014-10-24 19:38:08","style":{"id":121,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pumpkin Beer","shortName":"Pumpkin Beer","description":"Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uqEFL2","name":"Unicorn Killer","nameDisplay":"Unicorn Killer","description":"Unicorns are mythical creatures that once defined beauty and grace.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"HizvxH","name":"Hopcat","nameShortDisplay":"Hopcat","description":"HopCat was envisioned, designed, stocked and staffed with one mission in mind: to bring you great beer.","website":"http:\/\/hopcat.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:32:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1GIUTKYC8L","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"GANyEU","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"25 Ionia Ave SW","locality":"Grand Rapids","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49503","phone":"616-451-4677","website":"https:\/\/hopcat.com\/grand-rapids","latitude":42.9623769,"longitude":-85.670585,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-02-22 21:36:11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"rtMecd","name":"HopCat Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"6280 N.
