These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"GPsxRB","name":"OEC Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"OEC","description":"Ordinem Ecentrici Coctores = Order of the Eccentric Boilers.\r\n\r\nWe are an unusual brewery stemming from neither here nor there.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hlTjVP","name":"Vindicator IPA","nameDisplay":"Vindicator IPA","description":"Big hop aroma fills the nose with Tangerine, Grapefruit and a hint of Pine.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Our Sour Reserve lends itself wonderfully to enveloping the acidity of the grape with notes of lactic acid, and allows the polite pineapple and grapefruit character of Vidal Blanc to shine on the palate.","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/X0T2Xx\/upload_XT9fMe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/X0T2Xx\/upload_XT9fMe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/X0T2Xx\/upload_XT9fMe-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/X0T2Xx\/upload_XT9fMe-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/X0T2Xx\/upload_XT9fMe-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/X0T2Xx\/upload_XT9fMe-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-18 10:57:08","updateDate":"2018-06-11 19:58:21","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth. Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbach's until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.rodenbach.be\/","established":"1821","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jH1IY7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Spanjestraat 133-141","locality":"Roeselare","region":"West-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-051-27-28-10","website":"http:\/\/www.rodenbach.be\/","latitude":50.9460157,"longitude":3.1375433,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"1821","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"v5Uz0g","name":"Vintage 2014","nameDisplay":"Vintage 2014","description":"Vintage 2014 is a blend of 2-year aged XX Bitch Creek Double ESB and fresh Coming Home 2014, the brewery's Belgian-style quad.

For our limited-edition Vintage Blonde, it just happened to be a grape from California and a 27-year after-work hobby.\r\n\r\nKeith has an obvious passion for brewing beer. That goes without saying. But he also has a little-known passion for wine-making. In 1995, while he was crushing grapes and thinking back to his travels through California and French wine country, the idea of blending a beer with a wine popped into his head. Intrigued, he had to give it a shot.\r\n\r\nHe started by using the juice of Chardonnay grapes to give the beer a crisp, light quality, very much like a glass of Chardonnay. He then used white wheat as the only grain to create a clean, smooth finish that could not be achieved with other malts. After cellar-aging the batch for a couple of months, he tasted his latest work. He was pleasantly surprised with the clarity and refreshing taste.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, with wine and Craft beer growing in popularity with drinkers, he decided it would be a good time to bring it back. After a couple of years at festivals and special events, it started to gain a following. Then in 2010, it just happened to take home a gold medal from the Great American Beer Festival\u00ae. Knowing an ale this good should be shared, we distributed it in 2011 as Vintage Blonde Ale\u2122. So now, after six years, Vintage Blonde Ale is released nationally for all to enjoy.","abv":"8.5","ibu":"2","glasswareId":8,"availableId":3,"styleId":114,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","year":2012,"labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"The Chardonnay-grape character of Vintage Blonde Ale pairs well with grilled seafood, chicken, pork, or light salads.\r\n\r\nOne of our favorite recipes to pair with Blue Moon\u00ae Vintage Blonde Ale is Cedar Plank Salmon.","originalGravity":"1.07","createDate":"2012-09-03 18:57:40","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":114,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Wheat Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Fruit Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":4.1,"betaAcidMin":4.7,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":55.1,"humuleneMax":55.1,"caryophylleneMin":14.5,"caryophylleneMax":14.6,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":26,"myrceneMin":15.5,"myrceneMax":17.5,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":0.1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:31","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":865,"name":"Wheat Malt - White","description":"White wheat gives a malty flavor not available from raw wheat.","countryOfOrigin":"US","srmId":2,"srmPrecise":2.4,"moistureContent":4,"coarseFineDifference":2.2,"diastaticPower":130,"dryYield":86,"potential":1.04,"protein":14.5,"maxInBatch":60,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"Y","characteristics":[{"id":10,"name":"Malty","description":"Imparts a malty flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:57","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":2,"name":"2","hex":"FFD878"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"misc":[{"id":876,"name":"Acid Blend","category":"misc","categoryDisplay":"Miscellaneous","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:08:00"}]}},{"id":"ieoWq5","name":"Vintage Blonde","nameDisplay":"Vintage Blonde","abv":"4.2","ibu":"17","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ieoWq5\/upload_jwpJxf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ieoWq5\/upload_jwpJxf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ieoWq5\/upload_jwpJxf-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ieoWq5\/upload_jwpJxf-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ieoWq5\/upload_jwpJxf-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ieoWq5\/upload_jwpJxf-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-25 12:48:04","updateDate":"2015-12-17 15:06:12","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"7Tjp4C","name":"Adelbert's Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Adelbert's","description":"Adelbert\u2019s Brewery is committed to brewing Belgian-style, bottle-conditioned ales for people to seek, savor, and share with others.

The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth. Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbach's until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.rodenbach.be\/","established":"1821","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qZJOHj\/upload_QDpp99-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jH1IY7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Spanjestraat 133-141","locality":"Roeselare","region":"West-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-051-27-28-10","website":"http:\/\/www.rodenbach.be\/","latitude":50.9460157,"longitude":3.1375433,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"1821","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"D6gwX5","name":"Vintage Premium Lager","nameDisplay":"Vintage Premium Lager","description":"Short\u2019s Vintage Premium Lager is the perfect replica of today\u2019s mainstream American Pale Lagers, complete with a wort that\u2019s 50% blended rice syrup and hot water.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"p7K0fo","name":"Vinter Varmer Winter Ale","nameDisplay":"Vinter Varmer Winter Ale","description":"Our annual Winter Warmer Ale is our take on an English style old or stock ale traditionally brewed to beat the cold of Winter.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.

We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.

We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"L2L3dy","name":"Violent Femme","nameDisplay":"Violent Femme","description":"Historically the Saison beers were created to quench agricultural workers returning from the fields, very dry and light beers.

Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"N7CfsS","name":"Champion Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Champion","description":"Charlottesville's fastest-growing production  brewery and beer-drinking Tap Room located at the foot of the Belmont Bridge.","website":"http:\/\/www.championbrewingcompany.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-27 17:43:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:40:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JWE6I8GSQO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qCAOOu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"324 6th St SE","locality":"Charlottesville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22902","phone":"(434) 295-2739","website":"http:\/\/championbrewing.tumblr.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday 5-9\r\nThurs-Sat 4-11\r\nSunday 1-6","latitude":38.0279317,"longitude":-78.478483,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-27 17:44:40","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:15","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wednesday 5-9\r\nThurs-Sat 4-11\r\nSunday 1-6","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
