Founder, Kenny Thacker, originally got into brewing beer as a business opportunity with a full-service homebrewing store, the Fermentation Trap.  Since that time, he has fallen in love with beer and brewing and felt compelled to do it professionally, and in 2012, Kenny opened Beer Hound Brewery.\r\n\r\nNot long after Beer Hound opened, friends & beer entrepreneurs Frank Becker & Rick Cash saw the potential in the great-tasting brews that were part of the Beer Hound lineup. They joined forces with Beer Hound Brewery and decided to bring the great tasting microbrews to the Town of Culpeper, Virginia.  In October of 2014, Beer Hound Brewery opened its doors as the first-ever brewery in Culpeper. Local and visiting beer enthusiasts descended upon the new establishment immediately and now the Beer Hound brand is a mainstay of the arts district in Downtown Culpeper.\r\n\r\nAll of the Beer Hound beers are named after famous hounds in movies and history, with an attempt to link the beer style to the hound. Beer Hound Brewery serves a variety of beer styles fresh daily, so stop by and enjoy a pint!","website":"http:\/\/www.beerhoundbrewery.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:24:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"u2ExM0","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"201 Waters Place","extendedAddress":"#102","locality":"Culpeper","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22701","phone":"(540) 317-5327","website":"http:\/\/www.beerhoundbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:11:00 am - 6:00 pm\r\nWed - Thu:11:00 am - 7:00 pm\r\nFri:11:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:10:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSun:12:30 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":38.4719318,"longitude":-77.9943893,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:25:29","updateDate":"2015-04-28 14:18:14","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:30pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:00am-6:00pm,wed-11:00am-7:00pm,thu-11:00am-7:00pm,fri-11:00am-8:00pm,sat-10:00am-8:00pm,sun-12:30pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tue:11:00 am - 6:00 pm\r\nWed - Thu:11:00 am - 7:00 pm\r\nFri:11:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:10:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSun:12:30 pm - 6:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ztwSMb","name":"Teutonic Knight Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Teutonic Knight Hefeweizen","abv":"5.4","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-06 14:16:06","updateDate":"2017-07-06 17:37:57","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

The goal of Spalt Select was to reproduce the classic noble hop character of the Spalt Spalter landrace in a more easily grown hop. Spalt Select was reportedly chosen by Anheuser-Busch to replace Spalt Spalter and Tettnang Tettnanger hops in some of their recipes. Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau. Some growers are currently growing Spalt Select as an organic hop.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMin":2.5,"betaAcidMax":6.2,"humuleneMin":10,"humuleneMax":36,"caryophylleneMin":4,"caryophylleneMax":13,"cohumuloneMin":20,"cohumuloneMax":27,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":50,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":22,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:36","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":828,"name":"CaraHell","category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:56"},{"id":365,"name":"CaraPils\/Dextrin Malt","description":"Dextrine malt is a general term for a set of malts, including CaraPils and others, used to increase foam, head retention, sweetness, and body.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"KKyLlo","name":"Yellow House Canyon Brew Works","nameShortDisplay":"Yellow House Canyon Brew Works","description":"YHCBW is a production brewery, sitting on the edge of our namesake, bringing craft brewing to the plains in an exciting way.

This barley has a rich, smooth taste that stands up to the noticeable hop character of this beer. To live up to its big name, we've made it slightly higher in ABV too (6%).  To match the increase in gravity, we've also added more hops, and not the usual suspects.  A new hop variety from Germany named Polaris lends a unique character to the beer reminiscent of spicy mint and alpine herbs. Traditionally brewed Pilsners have a medium body, and ours stays true to this, providing ample body to support the increased hop character and bitterness.

In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.","website":"http:\/\/rahrbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:03:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IJ7AKS9UVG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"X6U0o8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 Galveston Avenue","locality":"Fort Worth","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76104","phone":"817-810-9266","website":"http:\/\/www.rahrbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm","latitude":32.7368128,"longitude":-97.3275585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-10-29 16:04:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":79,"name":"Magnum","category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:32"},{"id":132,"name":"Strisselspalt","description":"Strisselspalt, sometimes called Strisselspalter, is a French hop grown especially in the Alsace region.","countryOfOrigin":"FR","alphaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMax":5.5,"humuleneMin":15,"humuleneMax":25,"caryophylleneMin":8,"caryophylleneMax":10,"cohumuloneMin":20,"cohumuloneMax":25,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":30,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:37","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"FR","name":"FRANCE","displayName":"France","isoThree":"FRA","numberCode":250,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":371,"name":"Carafa II","description":"Used to intensify aroma and color in dark Munich beers and stouts.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","srmId":41,"srmPrecise":412,"moistureContent":4,"coarseFineDifference":1.5,"dryYield":70,"potential":1.032,"protein":11.7,"maxInBatch":5,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"N","characteristics":[{"id":1,"name":"Aromatic","description":"Imparts an aromatic quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:45","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":1924,"name":"CaraMunich","characteristics":[{"id":5,"name":"Caramel","description":"Imparts a caramel quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:57"},{"id":626,"name":"Melanoidin Malt","description":"Aromatic malt from Bamberg, Germany.
