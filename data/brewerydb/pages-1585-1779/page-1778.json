We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research\/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries. So, not only can we feel good for helping people, you can feel good every time you purchase Thirsty Planet beer.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"osLNb3","name":"Pizza Boy Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Pizza Boy","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaboybrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 18:39:41","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:16:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYVNK0BFWM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QBZAUO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2240 Millenium Way","locality":"Enola","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17025","phone":"717-728-3840","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaboybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Wed 11 am - 10 pm\r\nThurs - Sat 11 am - 11 pm","latitude":40.2887287,"longitude":-76.9698583,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 18:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Wed 11 am - 10 pm\r\nThurs - Sat 11 am - 11 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"udqEBe","name":"Yellow Brick Blonde","nameDisplay":"Yellow Brick Blonde","styleId":109,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-21 15:12:20","updateDate":"2017-08-28 03:43:20","style":{"id":109,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Cream Ale or Lager","shortName":"Cream Ale","description":"Mild, pale, light-bodied ale, made using a warm fermentation (top or bottom) and cold lagering.

Beginning in, 2010, we decided to expand our business and our dream. This is where the 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation of Sietsema Orchards & Cider Mill hope to thrive and grow. We are committed to providing quality produce, and by opening our doors to the public, providing a family farm experience that we hope you enjoy here in West Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.sietsemaorchards.com\/","established":"1954","mailingListUrl":"info@sietsemaorchards.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:23:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"G9QOj4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8540 2 Mile Rd NE","locality":"Ada","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49301","hoursOfOperation":"September Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday 10am-6pm\r\nSaturday 9am-6pm\r\n\r\nOctober Hours:\r\nTuesday-Friday\r\n10am-6pm\r\nSaturday\r\n9am-6pm\r\n\r\nNovember Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday:\r\n10am-6pm\r\n\r\nSaturday:\r\n9-6","latitude":42.997611,"longitude":-85.459116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","updateDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","hoursOfOperationNotes":"September Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday 10am-6pm\r\nSaturday 9am-6pm\r\n\r\nOctober Hours:\r\nTuesday-Friday\r\n10am-6pm\r\nSaturday\r\n9am-6pm\r\n\r\nNovember Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday:\r\n10am-6pm\r\n\r\nSaturday:\r\n9-6","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"49I83n","name":"Yellow Mellow Apple Cider","nameDisplay":"Yellow Mellow Apple Cider","description":"It is off-dry, 3% sweetness (from added cider, not added sugar) and fermented with a Champagne yeast.\r\n\r\nAt 5.5% alcohol, tart, apple-y and sweet, it's perfect on a pint of ice.\r\n\r\nYellowbelly's first gluten free product.","abv":"5.5","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-02-14 04:02:32","updateDate":"2018-02-14 20:50:36","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.
