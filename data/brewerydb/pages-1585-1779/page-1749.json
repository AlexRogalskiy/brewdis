This land has been in our family since the 1920\u2019s when our grandfather planted his first trees in Tieton, Washington. We take our stewardship of the land seriously and have been farming organically for the last 25 years.\r\n\r\nAs a third generation Yakima Valley farmer with a degree in horticulture from Washington State University and over thirty five years\u2019 experience in marketing produce, Craig has always been curious about the back-story: the history, production, science, and industry of food. Growing different varieties of trees is truly what makes Craig happy and he is always looking for new varieties to plant and nurture.  In 2008 he was introduced to cider apple varieties, those gnarly, inedible wild apple varieties needed to make great cider.  He planted twenty five varieties in a test block of two acres to study the growing patterns: did each fit into the existing bloom and harvest schedule of the farm, what were the flavor profiles of the fruit and how did that variety add to the cider that we wanted to make.\r\n\r\nFrom that original twenty five, Craig has narrowed it down to the eight most suitable for commercial production, never closing the door on annual experimentation when he learns of a new variety. We now have the largest acreage of cider apples and Perry pears in the state of Washington with 55 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Yakima Valley is the largest apple producing region in Washington and there is an infrastructure existing in our valley that provides many advantages when you are making cider.  Whether we are storing our apples in controlled atmosphere, sending our apricots and cherries to be processed, or selecting the complementary hops and pumpkin for our seasonal ciders \u2013 it all exists in the valley we call home.\r\n\r\nA love of land, food and drink has inspired us to make cider with the fruit we are growing at our ranch, Harmony Orchards.  We know the ciders we make are an expression of the harvest and reflective of the fruit and the place that it is grown.","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","established":"1920","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 20:31:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9ASIXD","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"619 West J Street","locality":"Yakima","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98902","phone":"509-571-1430","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","latitude":46.6158588,"longitude":-120.5217865,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","updateDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JVrCmS","name":"Wild West","nameDisplay":"Wild West","description":"100% Brett IPA","abv":"7.5","styleId":39,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 21:56:10","updateDate":"2015-09-09 13:40:19","style":{"id":39,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Brett Beer","shortName":"Brett","description":"Brett Beers are any range of color and may take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

(ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"ey4s2u","name":"Hop Capital Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Hop Capital","website":"http:\/\/www.yakimacraftbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ey4s2u\/upload_Qlowhq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ey4s2u\/upload_Qlowhq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ey4s2u\/upload_Qlowhq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ey4s2u\/upload_Qlowhq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ey4s2u\/upload_Qlowhq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-29 16:14:30","updateDate":"2019-07-20 17:59:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"XC0UH6YFM2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"O0JDg5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2920 River Road (#6)","locality":"Yakima","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98902","phone":"509-654-7357","website":"http:\/\/www.yakimacraftbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nTues: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nWed: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri:3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":46.617511,"longitude":-120.548718,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-29 16:15:44","updateDate":"2019-07-20 17:57:01","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nTues: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nWed: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri:3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 10:00 pm","tourInfo":"Name changed to Hop Capitol Brewing","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7bIgzs","name":"Wildberry Lambic","nameDisplay":"Wildberry Lambic","abv":"12","styleId":68,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-20 18:15:08","updateDate":"2016-01-20 18:15:08","style":{"id":68,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","shortName":"Fruit Lambic","description":"These beers, also known by the names framboise, kriek, peche, cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit flavors and aromas.

Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.

But while Matt\u2019s beer was incredible, his business plan was not (at least according to the banks) and nobody would lend him the money to start the brewery.\r\nUndaunted, he grabbed credit card applications on the way out, filled them out the same day, and opened Phillips Brewing Company on a mountain of credit card debt.  What palatial brewing fortress did this high-interest financing purchase? A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.  We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility\u2013the only one of its kind in Canada.

Brewed with four different hops, and five different malts, our IPA is complex, while still remaining approachable. Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, and Saaz hops lend our IPA a citrus aroma, with a touch of noble hop distinction and herbal complexity, and a smooth, clean bitterness. The use of five different malts in our grain bill provides Wildcat with the complex flavors of malty sweetness, bread, and caramel that we use to round out our brew. Just like the settlers of Wildcat Mountain who inspired its name, Wildcat IPA blazes its own path into history. We hope you\u2019ll be inspired to go your own way too, as you enjoy our Wildcat IPA.","abv":"6.2","ibu":"48","srmId":11,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9YV0rc\/upload_TeKLSZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9YV0rc\/upload_TeKLSZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9YV0rc\/upload_TeKLSZ-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9YV0rc\/upload_TeKLSZ-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9YV0rc\/upload_TeKLSZ-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9YV0rc\/upload_TeKLSZ-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.059","createDate":"2015-04-22 13:56:02","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:29:08","srm":{"id":11,"name":"11","hex":"D77200"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
