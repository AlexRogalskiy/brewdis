There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"cKQqRC","name":"Hopshire Farm and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Hopshire Farm","description":"We have been growing hops for 6 years and are very excited about hops farming coming back to New York.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Xj7zte","name":"Whiskey Stout","nameDisplay":"Whiskey Stout","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:30","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:47","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"yC7IbZ","name":"Sierra Blanca Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sierra Blanca","description":"Located in Moriarty, New Mexico and also known as Rio Grande Brewing Company.

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WtMfgN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","latitude":40.2795364,"longitude":-75.2143123,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:09:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xDSHbr","name":"Whiskeytown","nameDisplay":"Whiskeytown","abv":"9.5","srmId":40,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-15 17:08:29","updateDate":"2015-11-17 15:53:37","srm":{"id":40,"name":"40","hex":"36080A"},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby \u2013 brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"VVT7Jn","name":"Sidetracked Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Sidetracked","description":"A microbrewery in Morganton, NC offering classic styles and exciting experimental ales in a kid-and-pet friendly old industrial style taproom","website":"http:\/\/www.sidetrackedbrew.com","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVT7Jn\/upload_u8nXCq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVT7Jn\/upload_u8nXCq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVT7Jn\/upload_u8nXCq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVT7Jn\/upload_u8nXCq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVT7Jn\/upload_u8nXCq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-03 17:44:10","updateDate":"2019-06-18 19:58:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZJMSBHVG8N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"ht7kBX","name":"Sidetracked Brewery","streetAddress":"609 South Green Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 100","locality":"MORGANTON","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28655","phone":"8285445840","website":"https:\/\/www.sidetrackedbrew.com\/","latitude":35.7422235,"longitude":-81.6819897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-03 17:48:10","updateDate":"2019-06-04 18:55:36","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-3:00pm-10:00pm,tue-3:00pm-10:00pm,wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-1:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-1:00pm-8:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wXic9e","name":"WHISTLER","nameDisplay":"WHISTLER","description":"A light, refreshing petit blonde ale.","abv":"4.2","styleId":61,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-11 16:17:50","updateDate":"2015-06-11 16:17:50","style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family \u2013 thus the name The 3 Brewers \u2013 \u201cthree\u201d for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare \u00e0 Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes \u2013 all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-24 14:45:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Ste-Catherine","streetAddress":"732 Ste-Catherine St. W.","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","phone":"514.788.6333","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.ca\/eng\/ste_catherine.php","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:30 -

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

We simply love beer!! Always have, and always will. Our goal is to brew the best beer possible, using only natural ingredients and respecting the traditional art of brewing.\r\nThe beginning\u2026 Throughout our trips to Europe as a family, we have visited numerous Micros and specialized brewpubs and enjoyed amazing beer. When Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004 we were happy to see that many of the foreign beers we loved so much started being imported to the island!! Finally more quality and tasty beer options would be introduced to Cyprus.\r\nUnfortunately as we soon found out something was terribly wrong\u2026The beer we tasted and loved throughout Europe just didn\u2019t taste the same\u2026\r\nLong sea transportation and storage time in hot conditions stripped a huge amount of the taste and character of the beer we longed to see in Cyprus.\r\nThen we realized that it was up to us to get the job done.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.
