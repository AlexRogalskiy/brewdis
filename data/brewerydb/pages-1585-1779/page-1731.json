The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"K9WcRE","name":"Climax Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Climax","description":"Climax Brewing began as the dream of two home brewers who felt it was time for some good beer.

We also have a rotating selection of seasonal brews. Visit our Pubhouse in Bigfork for a fresh, locally farmed, seasonal menu featuring daily specials and a wide range of food entrees such as in-house smoked meats, seafood, our famous clam chowder, and homemade desserts.\r\n\r\nThe Flathead Lake Brewing Company started in 2004 in Woods Bay, Montana. Our owner Greg Johnston has two very specific goals. The first: to make the best beer ever. The second: to have fun doing it. Naming the brewery wasn\u2019t hard. FLBC overlooks the shores of the largest freshwater lake in the West \u2013 and we would argue the most beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 we were honored with becoming the youngest brewery ever to win not just one, but two, World Beer Cup awards. Our brewery brought home a Bronze medal for our Peg Leg Porter and a Silver medal for our Mutiny Stout.\r\n\r\nWe at FLBC work hard, play harder, and do everything to the highest standard. For us, it\u2019s about being leaders in the beer industry, it\u2019s about supporting local and environmental sustainability, and it\u2019s about contributing to the community that has so graciously embraced us. Most importantly for our crew, it\u2019s about making beer and food that we are proud of.

So with the old Rat gone, the new name and logo came from Tony\u2019s love of flying. Double Wing Brewing Co. has started over again with all new IPAs.\r\nThe Double Wing IPA is a bright and refreshing brew with a balanced hoppy finish. The all new Double Wing Red DIPA, or Red Double India Pale Ale is bringing both an intense hop aroma and a sweet malt flavor. Clocking in at 86 IBUs and just under 8.3% abv., this is one that \u201cHop Heads\u201d should put on there must try list. We also have a new recipe American Wheat, a Pale Ale, a Blueberry Kolsch, and our monster Imperial Stout.

The brewery was Aurora, Colorado\u2019s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

The barley malt makeup is exactly the same in each of the four and consists of three different malts. The total amount of grain in each of the four is also exactly the same, so each of them should have a virtually identical original gravity. The type and amount of hops in each of the four is exactly the same. And the processing through the brewhouse and fermentation is also exactly the same. The changing factors between the ales are the composition of the 55% of wheat used and the type and number of yeast strains used. In Wheat 2 the 55% of wheat is made up of two different kinds of wheat malt, and this ale is made with two different yeasts. Wheat 4 is made with four different wheats and four yeasts. Wheat six and eight made with six and eight wheats and yeasts respectively.

However, we soon realized we were somewhat limited and constrained by which beers were actually available in the Miami market -due to distribution and other factors. And since we're all about unfettered drinking and out of the box thinking, the concept soon changed to: \"let's brew our own!\". This way we would be free to experiment with both well known and more obscure styles and experiment with flavor profiles and combinations. The possibilities, which once looked constrained, now appeared limitless.\r\n\r\nEnter Robert Tejon and Seth Hammond! After meeting and networking within Miami's local brewer community for the better part of a year, Diego met Robert and Seth. They decided to start making some test batches, which eventually led to making one-off pilot batches for nationally-renowned events (please see our \"events\" section). As momentum gathered, we realized that there was great potential in this concept and decided that the brewpub was definitely the way we wanted to go.\r\n\r\nAs Gravity Brew Lab, our mission is to bring you uncompromising, top quality beer.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
