However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"3yPKEN","name":"Crying Eagle Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Crying Eagle","description":"First and only production craft brewery in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ll00zf","name":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jackie O's","description":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery prides itself in creating neo-traditional handcrafted artisan ales.

We have expanded into a 12,000 sq. ft., state of the art 30 barrel production facility, Edgewater, in South Downtown, Grand Junction, Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/kannahcreekbrewingco.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:11:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GQ9SC0PBOL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"eyYenc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1960 N. 12th Street","locality":"Grand Junction","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81501","phone":"970-263-0111","website":"http:\/\/kannahcreekbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SUN - THURS 11AM - 10PM\r\nFRI - SAT 11AM - 11PM\r\nPhone: 970-263-0111","latitude":39.085288,"longitude":-108.5522844,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2005","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"SUN - THURS 11AM - 10PM\r\nFRI - SAT 11AM - 11PM\r\nPhone: 970-263-0111","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"x2mRcs","name":"Edgewater Brewery","streetAddress":"905 Struthers Ave.","locality":"Grand Junction","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81501","phone":"(970) 243-3659","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday-Thursday 11am-10pm \r\nFriday & Saturday 11am-11pm","latitude":39.055173,"longitude":-108.557323,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-19 16:13:13","updateDate":"2016-05-19 16:13:13","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday-Thursday 11am-10pm \r\nFriday & Saturday 11am-11pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0hmdZ2","name":"Vertical Epic 03.03.03","nameDisplay":"Vertical Epic 03.03.03","abv":"8.5","styleId":64,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 16:06:25","updateDate":"2018-06-12 17:17:04","style":{"id":64,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Dark Strong","description":"Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"pNp8l9","name":"Fierce Beer","nameShortDisplay":"Fierce Beer","description":"Fierce Beer founders Dave Grant and David McHardy are both Oil and Gas veterans.

Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.
