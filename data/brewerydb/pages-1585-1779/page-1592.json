Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"fz3g3i","name":"Pipeworks Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Pipeworks","description":"Pipeworks began, as many breweries do, in the stove top kettles and plastic-bucket fermenters of the home brewer.

Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gUTa9y","name":"The Bubble","nameDisplay":"The Bubble","abv":"8.5","ibu":"35","styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-07 14:39:31","updateDate":"2015-12-07 14:39:31","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

FLBC overlooks the shores of the largest freshwater lake in the West \u2013 and we would argue the most beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 we were honored with becoming the youngest brewery ever to win not just one, but two, World Beer Cup awards.

For us, it\u2019s about being leaders in the beer industry, it\u2019s about supporting local and environmental sustainability, and it\u2019s about contributing to the community that has so graciously embraced us.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"ygt1Tu","name":"Paradox Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Paradox","description":"Modern brewing processes collide, headlong, into ancient beer.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"s8dOIH","name":"Exile Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Exile","description":"Inspired by the countless immigrants who have made our country what it is today, Exile Brewing Co. is a hand-crafted brewery fueled by the passion of a burn-bright lifestyle, and driven by a unique sense of gratitude for the customer, community and future of our land.","website":"http:\/\/www.exilebrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-29 13:51:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:43:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"E9HFY8LZNW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"xXJuyA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1514 Walnut Street","extendedAddress":"Des Moines","locality":"Des Moines","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50309","phone":"(515) 883-2337","website":"http:\/\/exilebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSaturday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSunday11AM\u20139PM\r\nMondayClosed\r\nTuesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nWednesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nThursday11AM\u201310PM","latitude":41.583013,"longitude":-93.637015,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-29 22:45:24","updateDate":"2018-08-24 17:00:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSaturday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSunday11AM\u20139PM\r\nMondayClosed\r\nTuesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nWednesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nThursday11AM\u201310PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OELYw2","name":"The Chesty Irish Red","nameDisplay":"The Chesty Irish Red","abv":"5.3","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OELYw2\/upload_hgTe2q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OELYw2\/upload_hgTe2q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OELYw2\/upload_hgTe2q-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OELYw2\/upload_hgTe2q-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OELYw2\/upload_hgTe2q-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OELYw2\/upload_hgTe2q-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-10 13:40:52","updateDate":"2015-12-17 16:21:00","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, \u201cAmerican beers are boring and just are not very satisfying\u201d. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County\u2019s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage\u2019s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo\u2019s, BJ\u2019s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.\r\n\r\nMark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time. Mark's Nut Brown Ale was also celebrated in Michael Jacksons world pocket guide to beer as \u201cworld class\u201d .","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:36:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:35:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DYW1O98USV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HIzVEo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"363 Airport Road","locality":"Oceanside","region":"California","postalCode":"92058","phone":"(760) 705-3221","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":33.2153901,"longitude":-117.3507698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:37:30","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"JbA8ks","name":"Tap and Kitchen","streetAddress":"7060 Miramar Road, Ste 100","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"858-695-9953","website":"http:\/\/legacybrewingtapandkitchen.com","latitude":32.8793454,"longitude":-117.1637115,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-24 07:02:09","updateDate":"2016-05-12 20:33:39","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
