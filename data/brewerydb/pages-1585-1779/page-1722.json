Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"1RDUGK","name":"Brauerei Herrenhausen","nameShortDisplay":"Brauerei Herrenhausen","website":"http:\/\/www.herrenhaeuser.de\/","established":"1868","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1RDUGK\/upload_9yhpfx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1RDUGK\/upload_9yhpfx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1RDUGK\/upload_9yhpfx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1RDUGK\/upload_9yhpfx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1RDUGK\/upload_9yhpfx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"BQ12RI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Herrenhuser Strae 83-99","locality":"Hannover","region":"Niedersachsen","phone":"49-(0)511-\/-7907-0","latitude":52.39348,"longitude":9.68141,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"F5XaVO","name":"Weizen Bier","nameDisplay":"Weizen Bier","description":"The beautiful Hefelinger!

With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:04:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0K4BFPNY1I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gsqySU","name":"Weizen Double Bock Ale","nameDisplay":"Weizen Double Bock Ale","styleId":53,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gsqySU\/upload_pZvgVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gsqySU\/upload_pZvgVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gsqySU\/upload_pZvgVs-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gsqySU\/upload_pZvgVs-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gsqySU\/upload_pZvgVs-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gsqySU\/upload_pZvgVs-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-08 11:39:27","updateDate":"2015-12-16 22:35:29","style":{"id":53,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Weizenbock \/ Weissbock","shortName":"Weizenbock","description":"This style can be either pale or dark (golden to dark brown in color) and has a high starting gravity and alcohol content.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"rjaX5E","name":"Vogel Hausbr\u00e4u Durlach","nameShortDisplay":"Vogel Hausbr\u00e4u Durlach","established":"1985","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8JV9HT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Amalienbadstra\u00dfe 16","locality":"Karlsruhe","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","postalCode":"D-76227","latitude":48.9981425,"longitude":8.4655858,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:40","updateDate":"2017-08-25 14:11:17","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Z6VC8I","name":"Weizen Eisbock","nameDisplay":"Weizen Eisbock","description":"This Gordon Biersch creation applies Eisbock brewing techniques to a bock made primarily from malted wheat.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

Approximately 10% of Ayinger beers are exported, mainly to Italy, the United States, and the rest of Europe. Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchener Str. 21, 85653, Germany","region":"Aying","postalCode":"85653","phone":"49080958890","latitude":47.972169,"longitude":11.773846,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2017-08-23 12:59:17","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","tourInfo":"Regular guided tours of the brewery in German\r\n(not including food):\r\nTuesdays at 11 a.m.\r\nThursdays at 6 p.m.\r\nSaturdays at 10 a.m.\r\nGroup tours required in other languages than German: by arrangement.\r\n\r\nBeer Culture Experience for corporate groups, \r\nassociations and clubs:\r\nGuided tour of the brewery with beer tasting and a typical\r\nBavarian delicacy. \r\nWe are always happy to provide any \r\nadditional information you may require.","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8EvXHQ","name":"Weizen-Radler alkoholfrei","nameDisplay":"Weizen-Radler alkoholfrei","description":"A 100-year-old innovation\r\n\r\nAbout 100 years ago enjoyed a drink of very popular which was mixed equal parts of wheat beer and lemonade.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-09-03 12:33:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"12HYVPGOJF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Fegley's Allentown Brew Works","streetAddress":"812 W Hamilton St","locality":"Allentown","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18101","phone":"610.433.7777","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com\/allentown-brewworks\/","latitude":40.6013531,"longitude":-75.4739451,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"SAPoSh","name":"Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works","streetAddress":"569 Main Street","locality":"Bethlehem","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18018","phone":"610-882-1300","latitude":40.6222629,"longitude":-75.3821851,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fIowAB","name":"Weizenbock","nameDisplay":"Weizenbock","description":"Made with 60% wheat malt, this darker, stronger Weiss beer features caramelized barley malt giving this beer a full-bodied mouth feel.
