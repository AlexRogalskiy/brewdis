Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"64tyso","name":"Edmund's Oast","nameShortDisplay":"Edmund's Oast","description":"Why Edmund's Oast?\r\n\r\nThe \u201cEdmund\u201d in the name comes from Edmund Egan, who began producing beer in Charleston after emigrating from England in the 1760s. \"Oast\u201d is a kiln used in the drying of hops. \r\n\r\nEdmund's Oast!","website":"http:\/\/edmundsoast.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-09 12:54:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:47:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RMLN3G6YQT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5sySnW","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"1081 Morrison Drive","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29403","phone":"(843) 557-4077","website":"http:\/\/edmundsoast.com","latitude":32.809804,"longitude":-79.9479209,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-09 12:55:08","updateDate":"2014-09-29 18:07:49","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ErVFFR","name":"Edmund's Oast Brewery","streetAddress":"1505 King St.","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29403","phone":"8437183224","website":"http:\/\/edmundsoast.com\/brewing-co\/contact\/","latitude":32.8172486,"longitude":-79.9537193,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-20 15:58:50","updateDate":"2018-08-20 14:39:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hvH8jQ","name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Bacon Maple Porter","nameDisplay":"Voodoo Doughnut - Bacon Maple Porter","description":"Rogue Ales has collided with Voodoo Doughnut to create Bacon Maple Ale!

Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"0tKnKg","name":"Koi Pond Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Koi Pond","description":"Koi Pond Brewing Company, LLC is soon-to-be Rocky Mount\u2019s first brewery, an eastern NC craft brewery that we can all be proud of!
