In 2012, a group of Colorado Natives formed the Tivoli Brewing Company to bring this Colorado legend back to life.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"BiNSTd","name":"Four Fathers Brewing, LLC","nameShortDisplay":"Four Fathers","description":"Not All Beers Are Created Equal","website":"http:\/\/www.fourfathersbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BiNSTd\/upload_S7quAN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BiNSTd\/upload_S7quAN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BiNSTd\/upload_S7quAN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BiNSTd\/upload_S7quAN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BiNSTd\/upload_S7quAN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-09 15:14:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:54:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"D81TOF6CK9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"2TcMqe","name":"Four Fathers Brewing, LLC","streetAddress":"1555 W Lincolnway Ste 105","locality":"Valparaiso","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46385","phone":"(219) 464-9712","website":"http:\/\/www.fourfathersbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm to 9pm\r\nFriday 4pm to 9pm\r\nSaturday 12pm to 9pm\r\nSunday 11am to 6pm","latitude":41.4735869,"longitude":-87.0797478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-09 15:19:21","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm to 9pm\r\nFriday 4pm to 9pm\r\nSaturday 12pm to 9pm\r\nSunday 11am to 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EbRKXa","name":"To Dan!","nameDisplay":"To Dan!","description":"In remembrance of and in tribute to our friend Dan Rosen of Mazurt Brewing Company, To Dan! is a flavorful, juicy, big IPA featuring fresh coconut-- it's like no other hoppy beer.","abv":"8.5","ibu":"85","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/EbRKXa\/upload_mQof2S-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/EbRKXa\/upload_mQof2S-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/EbRKXa\/upload_mQof2S-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/EbRKXa\/upload_mQof2S-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/EbRKXa\/upload_mQof2S-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/EbRKXa\/upload_mQof2S-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-31 15:29:43","updateDate":"2017-08-31 15:30:07","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home brew around that time and would share his batches with the Goulets and their friends. What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

The sweeteners we use in our brewing process are also sourced locally, and our production takes place in our cidery at the Genesee Regional Market in Rochester. We believe our cider is different \u2013 more authentic, more drinkable, more responsibly produced, more of an experience \u2013 than the more mass-produced ciders that may use imported apples.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
