In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"https:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:25:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TN7GC9UK6M","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RtDvmD","name":"The Emperor Strikes Black","nameDisplay":"The Emperor Strikes Black","description":"Brewed for the 2011 Brew NZ Awards Festival category (\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 black\u201d), this style defining Imperial Black Pilsner takes the second Black Emperor recipe, tweaks the malt bill, fiddles with the hops and unleashes a brand new death star of Pilsnery goodness wrapped in a black cloak","abv":"6.2","glasswareId":4,"availableId":8,"styleId":84,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-21 20:23:51","updateDate":"2012-12-21 20:29:10","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":8,"name":"Winter","description":"Available during the winter months."},"style":{"id":84,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","shortName":"Schwarzbier","description":"These very dark brown to black beers have a mild roasted malt character without the associated bitterness.

That ale is the Extra Special Bitter. \u2018The English Major\u2019 seemed an appropriate name for the beer, as it\u2019s not only an English style, but many of us on staff were English majors in college at one time or another. Cole and Tyler, who brewed the ESB, studied English. So did Maggie. So did Ross (but for only a couple semesters).\r\n\r\nESBs, or Extra Special Bitters, are similar to the ever-so-popular American Pale Ales. Our brewer Cole says, \u201cYou might even consider the APA to be a descendant of the ESB.\u201d But what differentiates the ESB from the Pales Ale, primarily, is a difference in maltiness and color. ESBs tend to be a touch darker than Pales (although the English Major is only 1 Standard Reference Method point more than our Rope Tow Pale Ale); and tasting a Pale Ale and ESB side by side, you will notice much more malt flavor in the ESB.\r\n\r\nThe name, \u2018Extra Special Bitter,\u2019 can be misleading. Compared to your average American IPA, the Extra Special Bitter isn\u2019t that bitter. The English Major ESB registers 40 International Bittering Units\u2013a moderate level of hop bitterness, but it\u2019s nowhere near as hoppy as our Cloudcroft IPA, which clocks in at 76 IBUs.\r\n\r\nRather than being too bitter, as its name misleadingly suggests, the English Major ESB is in fact quite balanced. The beer\u2019s malt character, which our brewer Cole describes as biscuity, isn\u2019t overpowered by its floral hop aroma, courtesy of British hops like Golding. The special British yeast strain we use in this beer\u2013and our Nut Brown Ale and our Porter\u2013also provides, through its esters, a stone fruit quality, too. These elements combine into a refreshing, authentic tasting British beer that is, yes, nice and balanced.\r\n\r\nThe English Major is a staff favorite, and we are excited to release it in the heart of American Craft Beer Week, which will continue until Sunday, May 21st. American Craft Beer Week is in its twelfth year, and we are joining with many, many craft breweries and establishments across the USA, to celebrate and promote small, independent craft brewers. So, today, you can hoist your glass of English Major ESB to the hard work, ingenuity, and culture behind American craft beer. It\u2019s a great time to be a beer drinker in the United States, and that is cause for celebration.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"40","styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-12 12:47:18","updateDate":"2017-06-12 12:47:18","style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"mJEOcA","name":"North High Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"North High","description":"Award winning craft brewery located in Columbus, OH.","website":"http:\/\/www.northhighbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:34:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:06:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZL9X3VN6AJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"FOC78c","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1288 N High St.","locality":"Columbus","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43201","phone":"(614) 407-5278","website":"http:\/\/www.NorthHighBrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Fri: 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\r\nSat - Sun: 11:00 am - 2:00 am","latitude":39.9886815,"longitude":-83.0054302,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:35:24","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:51:44","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Fri: 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\r\nSat - Sun: 11:00 am - 2:00 am","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"0fjfSD","name":"North High Brewing Taproom","streetAddress":"1288 N.
