These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"354Wth","name":"Birrificio del Ducato","nameShortDisplay":"Birrificio del Ducato","website":"http:\/\/www.birrificiodelducato.net\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-09 17:54:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N7CfsS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Strada Argini","region":"Soragna (PR)","postalCode":"43 43019","phone":"+39 0524 90 137","website":"http:\/\/www.birrificiodelducato.net\/","latitude":44.965514,"longitude":10.2243991,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-10 11:28:37","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IT","name":"ITALY","displayName":"Italy","isoThree":"ITA","numberCode":380,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Qk4kxL","name":"Torrential DIPA","nameDisplay":"Torrential DIPA","description":"Torrential is what we want in a Double IPA. It's big, dry, hugely aromatic, bursting with tropical-fruity hop flavors, balanced in bitterness, and terrifyingly drinkable. A mix of our base malt and a Belgian specialty malt gives the beer a small amount of malt character without adding any sweetness or coming off as anything other than a very west coast style Double IPA. The hops we chose to throw in the mix are a simple blend of our favorite hops that all on their own are hugely dominant in character, but when blended together they produce a beautiful marriage of mango, melon, grapefruit, papaya, orange, and jackfruit. Infinitely fruity and responsibly bittered, Torrential will overwhelm the palate with these bold and juicy flavors while remaining disturbingly crushable for a beer of its caliber.

Next door, the property\u2019s picturesque 1832 stone barn houses the County Cider Co.\u2019s tasting room and retail store.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Located at the corner of Broadway and Ottawa Streets it is the oldest working commercial building in Toledo. Our Brew Masters bring excellence in brewing and culinary experience to our craft beers. We transfer the same strength, creativeness, size, uniqueness and complexity of the architecture of the Oliver House to the artistry of our craft beer. No other brewery in the country brews under such history. With additional holding tanks and a bottling line located directly across the street at 28 Broadway, MBBCo's process requires great attention to detail and is very labor intensive. This delicate care sets our final product apart from other mass-produced brewing competitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year we have 7 beers on tap at the Maumee Bay Brew Pub, including the historical Buckeye Beer. Additionally, our beers are available at all of the restaurants in the historic Oliver House. Come enjoy our craft beer paired with Toledo's best steak at Rockwell's or enjoy a pint with a pizza baked in our wood oven at the Pub. Enjoy a brewer's sample and some classic gaming at Mutz. It's simply a great place to be - in a whole lot of old and new ways! Our beer is also available for sale in half-gallon growlers \"to go.\" We have twelve packs and kegs of Buckeye Beer available, plus kegs of select craft beers like Oktoberfest and Blitzen Ale seasonally.","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:33:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GCUYBF2Q4A","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cSJ6eN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 Broadway","locality":"Toledo","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43602","phone":"419-243-1302","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday \u2013 Thursday 3p.m. - 10p.m.\r\nFriday and Saturdays 3p.m.- 11p.m.","latitude":41.6432338,"longitude":-83.5384216,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday \u2013 Thursday 3p.m. - 10p.m.\r\nFriday and Saturdays 3p.m.- 11p.m.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lTcBBU","name":"Total Eclipse of the Hop","nameDisplay":"Total Eclipse of the Hop","abv":"5","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-12 23:10:46","updateDate":"2017-08-12 23:10:46","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"inBrUa","name":"Red Cypress Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Red Cypress","description":"Production brewery and taproom located in Winter Springs, FL.","website":"http:\/\/www.redcypressbrewery.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/inBrUa\/upload_Z4S2BI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/inBrUa\/upload_Z4S2BI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/inBrUa\/upload_Z4S2BI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/inBrUa\/upload_Z4S2BI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/inBrUa\/upload_Z4S2BI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-30 00:13:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:24:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LIW0ETJCG6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"G1Y8Vt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"855 E.
