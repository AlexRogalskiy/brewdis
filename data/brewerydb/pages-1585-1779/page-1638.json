We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SgctbA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-281-2437","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","latitude":45.540795,"longitude":-122.675594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eltojx","name":"Toughcats IPA","nameDisplay":"Toughcats IPA","description":"Brewed in collaboration with our favorite Fox Island musical trio The Toughcats, this single hop Palisade IPA is a smooth operator.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
