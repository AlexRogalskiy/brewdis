We begin with cull apples, apples that are too small, misshapen, or otherwise undesirable to grocery stores and use those as the base for most of our ciders.\r\n\r\nIn early 2019, we started a brand-new brewery born from a partnership with Dirty Bucket Brewing Co, now all under the name of Locust Cider & Brewing Co. We decided to throw out conventions and start over with a new and unique approach to brewing, inspired by cidermaking methods, delivering easy-to-drink, light-bodied beer while respecting traditions but not being anchored to them.\r\n\r\nOur taprooms and cideries outside of Woodinville are part of an expansion plan to make cider more accessible to a larger audience as well as provide a space to educate on the nuances of the cider world while allowing us to localize our efforts on a deeper level in the communities where we serve.\r\n\r\nWe currently have a cider and beer production facility and taproom in Woodinville, WA, standalone taprooms in Seattle and Tacoma (with plans to open additional taprooms in greater Washington in 2019), and a cider production facility and taproom in Fort Worth, TX with another set to open in Boulder, CO this summer.\r\n\r\nCurrently cans and bottles can be found throughout Washington, Oregon, California, and Texas with plans to continue expanding distribution nationally.","website":"https:\/\/www.locustcider.com\/home\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-30 02:46:13","updateDate":"2019-08-22 18:42:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hWEHWN","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Woodinville","region":"Washington","latitude":47.7542651,"longitude":-122.1634582,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-30 02:46:53","updateDate":"2016-07-30 02:46:53","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"14vdRr","name":"Sweet And Smokey Stout","nameDisplay":"Sweet And Smokey Stout","description":"Crushable.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"beerVariation":{"id":"r6SlF0","name":"Oarsman Ale","nameDisplay":"Oarsman Ale","abv":"4","styleId":46,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:48","updateDate":"2017-03-22 16:59:54","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y1yCgh","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Run","description":"Crooked Run Brewing is an award winning small brewery located in Sterling, Virginia, with an original nanobrewery located in Leesburg, Virginia","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:20:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:22:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HPJZNL1S6Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"gssG96","name":"Brewery\/Bar","streetAddress":"205 Harrison Street","locality":"Leesburg","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20175","phone":"(571) 918-4446","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.1127672,"longitude":-77.5625836,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:21:48","updateDate":"2017-04-04 17:53:04","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xpgL0V","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","streetAddress":"22455 Davis Dr, suite 120","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20164","phone":"571-375-2652","website":"crookedrunbrewing.com","latitude":38.9947623,"longitude":-77.4231583,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-03 20:00:27","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:29:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qADxhS","name":"Sweet Crude Stout","nameDisplay":"Sweet Crude Stout","description":"For those who can\u2019t get enough of coffee and chocolate forward flavor we bring Sweet Crude Stout.  \r\n\r\nBred from a scaled down Imperial recipe our American Stout wafts huge on the nose, follows with a complex body, and slowly draws out with a slight bite ready to be sampled again and again.

Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
