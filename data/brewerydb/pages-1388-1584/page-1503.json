The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

And it is! This bright golden-hued beer incorporates old-school Cluster hops (which are very underrated in our opinion) along with the rare (in this country) Celeia variety from Slovenia, which together offer up aromas reminiscent of authentic European lagers. There's a touch of fruitiness leaning toward a hint of lemon, along with prominent earthiness. Underlying those hops, we picked up crackery and very mild toasted malt notes. On the palate, those hops come through bright and zingy. The brewers went a little heavier with the malts than in many other pale lagers, leading to an ABV at the higher end of the spectrum for the style, as well as a satisfying foundation for those expressive hops.","abv":"6.3","ibu":"22","styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-02-17 01:59:51","updateDate":"2018-02-21 18:58:30","style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

The farm is a historic site, dating back to the Civil War, and is officially known as \u201cThe Encampment\u201d as the farm was used as a camp for Union soldiers leading up to the battle of Antietam.\r\nFollowing the Civil War, a fire destroyed most of the farmhouse. It was rebuilt in the 1890\u2019s on its original foundation. Today, the farmhouse, adjacent carriage house, and Civil War-era barn foundation still stand on the property. Additional buildings, such as the cider house and barns, were added later, designed to maintain the historic appearance and integrity of the property and surrounding area.\r\nRob Miller, his wife, Patty Power, and their three children moved to the farm in 2001. Prior to the Millers, the farm had never been used as an apple orchard. However, having always been cider fans (both fresh and hard cider) and with the farm located in a prime region to grow apples, they decided to enter the cider-making world.\r\nThe operation has been a family-affair from the beginning: fifteen of the Millers\u2019 extended family came to plant the initial 1,000 trees one weekend in the spring of 2001. By 2006, the trees were producing enough fruit to make the first batches of fresh cider. At this point, construction on the cider house commenced.\r\nBy 2008, the cider house was officially completed and approved to be open for business. During this time, numerous home-brew cider-makers discovered the farm and would buy fresh cider to take home and ferment into hard cider. Tim Rose, one of the home-brewers, had come back several times with refreshing cider and well-researched advice for the Millers\u2019 cider making. Tim was invited to join the family-owned and operated farm as the official cidermaker for Distillery Lane Ciderwork. He has since moved from carboys in his basement to his own building with stainless steel tanks!\r\nOpened for business as an official Maryland winery in 2010, Distillery Lane Ciderworks took its name from the rich history of the area. The whole valley was dotted with beer and whiskey-producing distilleries up until Prohibition. The remains of one of these distilleries can still be seen today down the road from the farm in the woods.\r\nDistillery Lane Ciderworks was the first licensed cidery in Maryland. More trees have been planted since 2001 and the orchard is now nine acres (over 3,000 trees)!\r\nSince 2010, the business has been featured in articles in media outlets such as The Washington Post and on the hit television show, \u201cDrinking Made Easy,\u201d where the host, Zane Lamprey, and his stuffed monkey, Pleepleus, visited the farm and tasted some of the cider.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"l1YmMC","name":"The Mussel Inn","nameShortDisplay":"The Mussel Inn","website":"http:\/\/www.musselinn.co.nz\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"UXN1pF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1259 State Highway 60","locality":"Onekaka","postalCode":"7182","phone":"03 5259241","website":"http:\/\/www.musselinn.co.nz\/","latitude":-40.7610229,"longitude":172.704597,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-09-01 19:44:34","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JMV0vv","name":"Spring Break","nameDisplay":"Spring Break (2019)","abv":"3.5","styleId":165,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2019,"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-04-17 19:18:31","updateDate":"2019-04-17 19:18:31","style":{"id":165,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Contemporary Gose","shortName":"Contemporary Gose","description":"Contemporary Goses are straw to medium amber, or, may take on the hue of added fruits or other ingredients if present.

There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"ZhGbaC","name":"Lucky Bucket Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Lucky Bucket","description":"After years of working a local brewpub and experimenting in the garage, three guys decided to take their know-how and passion for great beer and bottle it.\r\n\r\nLucky Bucket Brewing Company is Nebraska's newest craft brewery, growing almost as fast as we can brew it.
