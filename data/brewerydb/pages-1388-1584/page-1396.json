Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Saranac Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Saranac","description":"Our attention to detail and uncompromising commitment to quality represent the signature trademark of the Matt Brewing Company and our award-winning Saranac Beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.saranac.com\/","established":"1888","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:23:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VNK3S4TLE1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"RQ96Nf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"811 Edward Street","locality":"Utica","region":"New York","postalCode":"13502","phone":"800-690-3181-x222","website":"http:\/\/www.saranac.com\/","latitude":43.104492,"longitude":-75.245249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1888","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qHryNa","name":"Saranac Red IPA","nameDisplay":"Saranac Red IPA","description":"Our Red IPA is a twist on a traditional west coast IPA featuring a deep red color from European dark caramel malts.

There, they developed the vision of Prairie Sun Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter 19 months their vision became a reality as they took their passion and hard work, and brewed their first batch of beer on a 10-barrel system.

By June 2015, Prairie Sun had grown to 12 employees and could be found in many restaurants around Saskatoon.
