Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:51:48","updateDate":"2019-05-22 20:29:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PJH5R2IXQV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qUIYuC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1710 N Mill St","locality":"Jackson","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39202","phone":"(601) 201-0988","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com","latitude":32.3196024,"longitude":-90.1883188,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:52:56","updateDate":"2019-05-22 20:29:21","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-7:00pm,sat-4:00pm-7:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ru27XA","name":"Sir Charles Barley Wine","nameDisplay":"Sir Charles Barley Wine","description":"Our new Barley Wine is brewed with eight different malts and three kinds of hops,all coming together to create a dark, malty, high alcohol beer with complex fruit and caramel flavors.","abv":"9.5","ibu":"62","styleId":17,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.085","createDate":"2015-03-27 16:40:22","updateDate":"2015-03-27 16:40:23","style":{"id":17,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"British Barleywine","description":"British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

He produces a wide variety of beers, from the light, refreshing Siskiyou Golden Ale to the deep, impenetrable Black Bear Double Stout, which won the Gold Medal at the 2003 GABF and the Silver Medal in 2006 and 2008 in the foreign-style stout category. In addition, there is always at least one seasonal beer on tap to fit the mood of the season and one selection served on nitrogen.","website":"http:\/\/www.alamedabrewhouse.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"16OBTZXNR9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WDrFlD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4765 NE Fremont St","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97213","phone":"503-460-9025","website":"http:\/\/www.alamedabrewhouse.com\/","latitude":45.5484823,"longitude":-122.613645,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:05","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kA3zHu","name":"Siskiyou Kid","nameDisplay":"Siskiyou Kid","abv":"6.8","ibu":"66","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-12 22:17:28","updateDate":"2015-06-15 19:35:51","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Today some Spalter hops are also grown in other parts of Germany and marketed simply as Spalt. Spalt Spalter has a mild, spicy aroma that is often compared to Czech Saaz or Tettnang Tettnanger. Can be used in any beer calling for a noble hop. Because of the poor growing characteristics of this hop, Spalt Select, a hop claimed to have similar flavor and aroma but better growing characteristics, was released by the German hop breeding program at H?ll in the 1980s, and is now grown extensively both in Spalt and in the the Hallertau. Some Spalt Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\".","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":2.5,"betaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMax":5,"humuleneMin":20,"humuleneMax":30,"caryophylleneMin":8,"caryophylleneMax":13,"cohumuloneMin":22,"cohumuloneMax":29,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":35,"farneseneMin":12,"farneseneMax":18,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:37","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":370,"name":"Carafa I","description":"Used to intensify aroma and color in dark Munich beers and stouts.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","srmId":41,"srmPrecise":337,"moistureContent":4,"coarseFineDifference":1.5,"dryYield":70,"potential":1.032,"protein":11.7,"maxInBatch":5,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"N","characteristics":[{"id":1,"name":"Aromatic","description":"Imparts an aromatic quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:44","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":1924,"name":"CaraMunich","characteristics":[{"id":5,"name":"Caramel","description":"Imparts a caramel quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:57"},{"id":650,"name":"Munich Malt","description":"Munich Malt has a malty sweet flavor characteristic and adds a reddish amber color to the beer.
