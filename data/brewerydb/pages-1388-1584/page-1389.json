The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":4.1,"betaAcidMin":4.7,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":55.1,"humuleneMax":55.1,"caryophylleneMin":14.5,"caryophylleneMax":14.6,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":26,"myrceneMin":15.5,"myrceneMax":17.5,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":0.1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:31","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":370,"name":"Carafa I","description":"Used to intensify aroma and color in dark Munich beers and stouts.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","srmId":41,"srmPrecise":337,"moistureContent":4,"coarseFineDifference":1.5,"dryYield":70,"potential":1.032,"protein":11.7,"maxInBatch":5,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"N","characteristics":[{"id":1,"name":"Aromatic","description":"Imparts an aromatic quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:44","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":401,"name":"CaraWheat","description":"Caramel wheat malt, also known by the Weyermann trademarked name Carawheat, is prepared by the same method as traditional barley crystal and caramel malt.","srmId":46,"srmPrecise":46,"dryYield":75.7,"potential":1.035,"maxInBatch":30,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"N","characteristics":[{"id":1,"name":"Aromatic","description":"Imparts an aromatic quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:46","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14"}]}},{"id":"UWdhqs","name":"Samuel Adams East-West K\u00f6lsch","nameDisplay":"Samuel Adams East-West K\u00f6lsch","description":"Light and fragrant, Samuel Adams\u00ae East West K\u00f6lsch has a floral and herbal character that balances the refreshing German K\u00f6lsch style.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"1wSztN","name":"Boston Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Boston Beer Company","description":"Today, we're a team of about 750 people, and we all share a common passion for bringing great Samuel Adams beers to beer lovers everywhere.

These hops impart a citrusy, piney, and earthy flavor that\u2019s balanced by a roasted malt sweetness for a complex and playful brew.\r\n\r\nOur inspiration for this brew began with the idea of taking some of the elements we loved about IPAs, with their citrusy, piney character, and seeing what happened when we combined it with other style influences.  In our travels to Belgium we fell in love with the complex character of their distinctive yeasts with their spicy and fruity quality.  This wasn\u2019t an obvious fit with the hop character of an IPA but we had to give it a shot.  The trick was in finding the balance of these flavors.  The result is golden ale with layers of complex flavor from apricot and clove, to a cereal maltiness, and a citrusy hop finish.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"55","glasswareId":5,"srmId":13,"availableId":4,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ImL6MP\/upload_KEJIM3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ImL6MP\/upload_KEJIM3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ImL6MP\/upload_KEJIM3-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ImL6MP\/upload_KEJIM3-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ImL6MP\/upload_KEJIM3-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ImL6MP\/upload_KEJIM3-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"The spicy clove and hop bitterness balance out the strong flavors of a blue cheese without being overpowering.

Every autumn for over twenty years, Jim Koch has traveled to one of the oldest hop growing regions in the world, the Hallertau region of Bavaria Germany, to hand select the Noble hops for our beers, including the Hallertau Mittelfrueh variety.  This special variety is considered to be one of the best in the world.  Samuel Adams\u00ae Hallertau Imperial Pilsner is a celebration of these extraordinary hops. \r\n\r\nThis beer is one of the hoppiest in the world.  With the first sip there\u2019s an explosion of some of the world's finest hops.  And we mean \u201cexplosion\u201d in a good way.  This bold brew highlights the spicy, citrus flavors and aromas of the Hallertau Mittelfrueh hop that is abundant in the recipe.  The Hallertau Mittelfrueh hop is prized for its delicate flavor rather than purely for its level of bitterness.  As a result, the high levels of these hops give the beer an intense flavor without being overpowering. The beer remains well balanced from beginning to end, and continues to always be, well, \"hoppy,\" providing hop lovers with an amazing beer drinking experience.","abv":"8.5","glasswareId":4,"availableId":2,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LYai9f\/upload_qjptUg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LYai9f\/upload_qjptUg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LYai9f\/upload_qjptUg-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LYai9f\/upload_qjptUg-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LYai9f\/upload_qjptUg-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LYai9f\/upload_qjptUg-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.0875","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:09","updateDate":"2015-12-16 03:30:26","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"1wSztN","name":"Boston Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Boston Beer Company","description":"Today, we're a team of about 750 people, and we all share a common passion for bringing great Samuel Adams beers to beer lovers everywhere.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

The vanilla and caramel oak character is balanced by the sweetness and subtle roastiness of our blend of malts for a smooth dry finish.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"15","glasswareId":5,"srmId":25,"availableId":2,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/v63uVq\/upload_aMZLGy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/v63uVq\/upload_aMZLGy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/v63uVq\/upload_aMZLGy-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/v63uVq\/upload_aMZLGy-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/v63uVq\/upload_aMZLGy-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/v63uVq\/upload_aMZLGy-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pair the roasted caramel malt blend of Mighty Oak Ale with the variety of complex flavors of barbeque ribs.","originalGravity":"1.0569","createDate":"2012-09-08 17:51:12","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:10:26","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":25,"name":"25","hex":"7B1A00"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Deep amber in color, this rugged brew\u2019s distinctive aroma and flavor comes from aging on a bed of juniper berries.  The herbal, woodsy, and ripe citrus character of the juniper enlivens a sturdy and smooth malt backbone for a fresh and flavorful brew.\r\n\r\nFor us, the legend of this sahti goes way beyond its Nordic roots.  It\u2019s been a labor of love, or at one time some may have said hopeless pursuit, among a few of our brewers.  For almost 8 years we\u2019ve been tinkering with it, from experimenting with its traditional, if rudimentary, technique of brewing with full juniper branches to trying variations of berries, malts, and rye.  We kept searching for just the right combination of ingredients and process to capture this brew\u2019s distinctive character of woodsy earthiness, citrus, and spice.  \r\n\r\nAfter all of those trials, we\u2019re excited to finally get to share this unique brew outside of our brewery.","abv":"7","ibu":"16","glasswareId":5,"srmId":30,"availableId":2,"styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m3EKy9\/upload_pSpFyM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m3EKy9\/upload_pSpFyM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m3EKy9\/upload_pSpFyM-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m3EKy9\/upload_pSpFyM-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m3EKy9\/upload_pSpFyM-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m3EKy9\/upload_pSpFyM-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"The earthy, woodsy, & citrus flavors of this brew can perfectly complement the flavor of an herb roasted chicken with rosemary, thyme, lemon & mushrooms.","originalGravity":"1.0707","createDate":"2012-09-08 18:21:11","updateDate":"2016-02-11 18:06:43","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":30,"name":"30","hex":"600903"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"1wSztN","name":"Boston Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Boston Beer Company","description":"Today, we're a team of about 750 people, and we all share a common passion for bringing great Samuel Adams beers to beer lovers everywhere.
