Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Not much happened for quite a while after that. I mean, we made some beers and stuff I guess. The beers were kindly called \"niche\" by some, and more often called \"weird shit that's not IPA\" by most. We brewed styles that we love, and often styles that were overlooked by the crowds in their rush to drink the next hazy triple-dry-hopped IPA bomb.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewaucracy.co.nz\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UkEpjL\/upload_5fbGS6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UkEpjL\/upload_5fbGS6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UkEpjL\/upload_5fbGS6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UkEpjL\/upload_5fbGS6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UkEpjL\/upload_5fbGS6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-27 20:22:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ODeoKt","name":"Brewaucracy","streetAddress":"34 Mahana Road","locality":"Te Rapa","region":"Hamilton","postalCode":"3200","phone":"07 282 0254","website":"http:\/\/www.brewaucracy.co.nz\/","latitude":-37.7589038,"longitude":175.2515577,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-27 20:26:13","updateDate":"2018-06-27 20:26:13","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-11:00am-7:00pm,fri-11:00am-7:00pm,sat-11:00am-7:00pm,sun-11:00am-7:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VK1NzD","name":"Smoky Ale","nameDisplay":"Smoky Ale","abv":"5.7","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VK1NzD\/upload_gEVDYg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VK1NzD\/upload_gEVDYg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VK1NzD\/upload_gEVDYg-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VK1NzD\/upload_gEVDYg-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VK1NzD\/upload_gEVDYg-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VK1NzD\/upload_gEVDYg-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-05 18:02:15","updateDate":"2018-11-02 19:59:36","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"5yhKSo","name":"The Tap Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"The Tap","website":"http:\/\/www.thetapbeerbar.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5yhKSo\/upload_8HI4kM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5yhKSo\/upload_8HI4kM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5yhKSo\/upload_8HI4kM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5yhKSo\/upload_8HI4kM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5yhKSo\/upload_8HI4kM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-13 16:27:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:25:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"14KTMZGH0P","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"0C9lcL","name":"The Tap","streetAddress":"101 N.
