The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Founder, Kenny Thacker, originally got into brewing beer as a business opportunity with a full-service homebrewing store, the Fermentation Trap.  Since that time, he has fallen in love with beer and brewing and felt compelled to do it professionally, and in 2012, Kenny opened Beer Hound Brewery.\r\n\r\nNot long after Beer Hound opened, friends & beer entrepreneurs Frank Becker & Rick Cash saw the potential in the great-tasting brews that were part of the Beer Hound lineup. They joined forces with Beer Hound Brewery and decided to bring the great tasting microbrews to the Town of Culpeper, Virginia.  In October of 2014, Beer Hound Brewery opened its doors as the first-ever brewery in Culpeper. Local and visiting beer enthusiasts descended upon the new establishment immediately and now the Beer Hound brand is a mainstay of the arts district in Downtown Culpeper.\r\n\r\nAll of the Beer Hound beers are named after famous hounds in movies and history, with an attempt to link the beer style to the hound. Beer Hound Brewery serves a variety of beer styles fresh daily, so stop by and enjoy a pint!","website":"http:\/\/www.beerhoundbrewery.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:24:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"u2ExM0","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"201 Waters Place","extendedAddress":"#102","locality":"Culpeper","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22701","phone":"(540) 317-5327","website":"http:\/\/www.beerhoundbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:11:00 am - 6:00 pm\r\nWed - Thu:11:00 am - 7:00 pm\r\nFri:11:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:10:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSun:12:30 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":38.4719318,"longitude":-77.9943893,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:25:29","updateDate":"2015-04-28 14:18:14","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:30pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:00am-6:00pm,wed-11:00am-7:00pm,thu-11:00am-7:00pm,fri-11:00am-8:00pm,sat-10:00am-8:00pm,sun-12:30pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tue:11:00 am - 6:00 pm\r\nWed - Thu:11:00 am - 7:00 pm\r\nFri:11:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:10:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSun:12:30 pm - 6:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ztwSMb","name":"Teutonic Knight Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Teutonic Knight Hefeweizen","abv":"5.4","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-06 14:16:06","updateDate":"2017-07-06 17:37:57","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Spalt Select was reportedly chosen by Anheuser-Busch to replace Spalt Spalter and Tettnang Tettnanger hops in some of their recipes. Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau.

Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau.

Unfortunately due to laws in Texas we can't tell you where you can buy our beers, but we are working at trying to get them to as many of your favorite craft beer establishments as possible.","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:26:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Z3WG95PJN1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Yr1UcD","name":"Southern Star Brewing Company","streetAddress":"3525 N Frazier","locality":"Conroe","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77303","phone":"936-441-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","latitude":30.3585757,"longitude":-95.4741966,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:45:56","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3zXID0","name":"Texas Helles","nameDisplay":"Texas Helles","description":"\"Helles\" is German for pale or light in color, but this beer is made for Texas!\r\n \r\nTexas Helles is a crisp, golden lager fashioned after the highly drinkable beers found in the boisterous beer halls of Bavaria.\r\n \r\nAll-German malts create a slightly sweet front balanced by tangy Hallertau hops in the finish.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

While this lager is based on traditional recipes, several modifications make this beer exceptional.  The grist is over 90% Hanka variety Pilsner malt from Bohemia: an heirloom barley variety related to the oldest cultivated barleys in Eastern Europe.  This barley has a rich, smooth taste that stands up to the noticeable hop character of this beer. To live up to its big name, we've made it slightly higher in ABV too (6%).  To match the increase in gravity, we've also added more hops, and not the usual suspects.  A new hop variety from Germany named Polaris lends a unique character to the beer reminiscent of spicy mint and alpine herbs. Traditionally brewed Pilsners have a medium body, and ours stays true to this, providing ample body to support the increased hop character and bitterness.  Perfect for relaxing on the patio or even for cooler Fall weather, this versatile lager broadens the horizon for traditionally brewed Pilsner lager.","abv":"6","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-14 19:16:18","updateDate":"2013-08-14 19:19:15","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
