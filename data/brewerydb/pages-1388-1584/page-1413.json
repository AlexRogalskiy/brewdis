To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3u5FRz","name":"Scottish Pride","nameDisplay":"Scottish Pride","description":"This traditional Scottish \u201c80 schilling\u201d ale is complex but simple.

(Check him out @ www.scottykarate.com) So, we decided to make a beer and name it in his honor. This beer is a big, full bodied Scottish ale. It is 9.75% alc. but it is very smooth and balanced. Since Scotty is also very passionate about  beer I asked him to write a description for you, so from the man himself...\r\n\r\nAroma: Smells like A fresh caramel apple with a hint of cinnamon inside of cranberry shortbread. Or maybe fresh home made hard candy (from home economics class-7th grade).\r\nFlavor: Tastes like a smokey chocolate chip cookie, wild roadside cherry-asparagus, woody, crispy leaf on a fall day. -SK","abv":"9.75","glasswareId":5,"srmId":21,"availableId":4,"styleId":8,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NAIMF9\/upload_beHIYj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NAIMF9\/upload_beHIYj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NAIMF9\/upload_beHIYj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NAIMF9\/upload_beHIYj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NAIMF9\/upload_beHIYj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NAIMF9\/upload_beHIYj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-10 01:40:28","updateDate":"2015-12-16 14:54:37","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":21,"name":"21","hex":"952D00"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":8,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Heavy Ale","shortName":"Scottish Heavy","description":"Scottish heavy ale is moderate in strength and dominated by a smooth, sweet maltiness balanced with low, but perceptible, hop bitterness.

The color reflects the choice of fruit. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"21","abvMin":"5.6","abvMax":"8.6","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.
