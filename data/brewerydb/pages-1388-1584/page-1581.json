There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"HA9fWD","name":"Brickyard Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Brickyard","website":"http:\/\/brickyardbrewingcompany.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HA9fWD\/upload_if3AUo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HA9fWD\/upload_if3AUo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HA9fWD\/upload_if3AUo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HA9fWD\/upload_if3AUo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HA9fWD\/upload_if3AUo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 16:40:05","updateDate":"2019-10-10 19:31:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HPUJGAC5EK","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"X01pAT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"436 Center Street","locality":"Lewiston","region":"New York","postalCode":"14092","phone":"(716) 754-7227","website":"http:\/\/brickyardbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nTuesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nWednesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nThursday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nFriday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSaturday: 1:00 PM \u2013 1:00 AM,\nSunday: 10:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM","latitude":43.173119,"longitude":-79.043139,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 16:40:07","updateDate":"2018-08-17 16:40:07","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nTuesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nWednesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nThursday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nFriday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSaturday: 1:00 PM \u2013 1:00 AM,\nSunday: 10:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WZI4Td","name":"Tenderfoot","nameDisplay":"Tenderfoot","description":"Lively and fruity, sometimes sweet and sometimes bittersweet, but always a good choice.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"yltqrR","name":"Tennent Caledonian Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Tennent Caledonian","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"uCyeOp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"161 Duke Street","locality":"Glasgow","region":"Scotland","phone":"44-(0141)-552-6552","latitude":55.8593325,"longitude":-4.2324123,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oA6LwE","name":"Tennents Peak Double IPA","nameDisplay":"Tennents Peak Double IPA","description":"Fresh from the brew house, the Tennent\u2019s Peak Double IPA draws upon the legendary \u2018first batch\u2019 of Mount Tennent Pale Ale that bragged flavours too intense and heavy to be classed as a session pale ale.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"bKPbvo","name":"Wormtown Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Wormtown","description":"Worcester's only brewery.

The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"aORdIX","name":"Perennial Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Perennial","description":"Our philosophy is to brew beer with the adventurous craft beer drinker in mind\u2014focusing on hand-crafted, small batches of beer, using local, seasonal and organic ingredients as much as possible.\r\n\r\nOur beers are influenced mostly by Belgian and American craft styles, but the addition of premium ingredients such as fruits, spices or wild yeast strains sometimes causes the beers to defy traditional categories.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

A unique interpretation of our flagship Allagash White, Tenth Anniversary is a blend of two different whites: a sweeter batch (brewed in February, 2005) and a drier batch (brewed in March, 2005). By blending the two batches, an additional complexity is imparted. Further complexity, most notably expressed by the delicate vanilla notes, was gained by aging some of the beer in new oak barrels. \r\n\r\nSimilar to our other ales, Tenth Anniversary is bottle conditioned. Just prior to bottling, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast was added to the \u2018still\u2019 beer (at this stage there is no carbonation present). After bottling, the beer was aged in the warm room, where the fresh dose of yeast ferments the sugar, and naturally carbonates the beer. \r\n\r\nThe batch of Tenth Anniversary was bottled in May of \u201905 (800 cases, six bottles in each case), and it is the only batch that will be available. Due to the unique brewing process of this special ale, it is important to store the bottle upright and serve it cold. The bottle should be chilled in a refrigerator for 12 hours, or in an ice bucket with water and ice for 30 minutes before serving.","abv":"10","glasswareId":5,"availableId":3,"styleId":64,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:21","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":64,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Dark Strong","description":"Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"kGYkIn","name":"Wild Beer Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Wild Beer Co.","description":"Wild Beer, Wild Yeasts, Wild Ingredients, Wild Ideas, Wild Ambitions...","website":"http:\/\/wildbeerco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-01 14:50:41","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ryy587","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Lower Westcombe Farm","extendedAddress":"Evercreech Shepton Mallet","locality":"Somerset","region":"England","postalCode":"BA4 6ER","website":"http:\/\/wildbeerco.com\/","latitude":51.1517774,"longitude":-2.4633889,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-01 14:52:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
