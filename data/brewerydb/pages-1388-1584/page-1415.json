Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles.

The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FtfsIi","name":"Scratch #55 Double IPA (2011)","nameDisplay":"Scratch #55 Double IPA (2011)","description":"With 2011 coming to a close, we are in the mood for hops!

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours.

Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C.

The resulting brew is a take on the Roggenbier style\u2014an uncommon German ale brewed with a portion of rye malt and a weizenbier yeast strain. Scratch #28 is loosely based on our own Dreamweaver Wheat beer recipe, but with several significant changes. First, rye malt makes up 25% of the malt bill, replacing a portion of white wheat. Malted rye gives the Troggen Roggen a spiciness, creamy mouth feel, and fantastic head retention properties. Second, lightly toasted Munich and Vienna malts contribute color and a pleasant breadiness. The Andechs Weizen yeast strain offers a clove and banana profile slightly different from our house weizen strain, and the addition of Hersbrucker and Crystal hops in the hopback give a spicy and lightly citrus end-note to the beer. As always, malted wheat gives the beer a tasty doughy flavor and thirst-quenching tartness. Unfiltered, the Troggen Roggen is a cloudy amber-orange brew meant to be drunk fresh, and in warm weather.

Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness.

Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

French-Style Bi\u00e9re de Garde may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"16","ogMin":"1.06","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"7Tjp4C","name":"Adelbert's Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Adelbert's","description":"Adelbert\u2019s Brewery is committed to brewing Belgian-style, bottle-conditioned ales for people to seek, savor, and share with others.  We believe quality beers require quality ingredients and a painstaking attention to detail throughout the brewing process.  \r\n\r\nAdelbert\u2019s uses Bohemian old-world floor malted barley, low alpha Noble Czech hops, and fresh yeast propagated at the brewery. In our seven vessel brewhouse, we use a time consuming, multi-temperature decoction mash technique which extracts a more complex flavor from our grains.\r\n\r\nWe produce a gambit of hand-crafted Belgian style ales right here in Austin, Texas. With our vast array of beer styles, you're sure to find a brew that suits you.\r\n \r\nOur Belgian-Style Ales include:\r\nNaked Nun Wit\r\nBlack Rhino Black Ale\r\nScratchin' Hippo Biere de Garde\r\nPhilosophizer Saison\r\nDancin' Monks Dubbel Ale\r\nTripel B Tripel Ale\r\nThe Traveler Belgian IPA\r\nFlyin' Monks Quadrupel Ale\r\n \r\nAlso, look for our Barrel-Aged \"Vintage Series\" where we age one of our eight ales in oak barrels for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough our selection of beer is great to enjoy by itself; each of them also pair perfectly with just about any food. From spicy Thai food to a backyard barbecue with ribs and brisket, to a formal dinner with steak or seafood and a dark chocolate dessert; our artisanal Belgian-style ales go with pretty much everything. Please share pictures and recipes that you've either used our beer to cook with or have enjoyed right alongside them!","website":"http:\/\/www.adelbertsbeer.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:54:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0EFM4XQCTO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"6PBXvz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2314 Rutland Drive","extendedAddress":"Suite #100","locality":"Austin","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78758","phone":"512-568-1462","website":"http:\/\/www.adelbertsbeer.com\/","latitude":30.382666,"longitude":-97.720162,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:17:16","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
