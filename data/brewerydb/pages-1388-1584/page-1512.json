He designed a plane and built it with $1800 fom his parents after they had mortgaged their home.  Anxious to try his new design, he promptly flew and crashed the plane, demolishing it.  He redesigned and successfully flew his plane, possibly making him the first person in Fort Wayne to fly on his own.  This earned him the name Birdboy.  After making a name for himself locally, Birdboy travelled the country and the world, all the while updating and refining his design.  He became a huge influence on aviation throughout the world, and Smith Field here in Fort Wayne is named after him. \r\n \r\nThrough Birdboy Brewing, we hope to embrace Birdboy's adventurous spirit by offering new and exciting choices in the local beer scene.","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:46:42","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:34:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OJGXET78CY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cxmroT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"210 E Collins Rd.","locality":"Fort Wayne","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46825","phone":"260-579-5508","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","latitude":41.1217689,"longitude":-85.1395111,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:53:57","updateDate":"2018-07-25 18:37:49","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"zqCalz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"314 N Main St.","locality":"Roanoke","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46783","phone":"(260) 579-5508","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tues - Friday 5pm-10pm\r\nSat 11am-10pm\r\nSun 11-7pm","latitude":40.9634013,"longitude":-85.3728007,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-25 18:42:08","updateDate":"2018-07-25 18:42:08","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tues - Friday 5pm-10pm\r\nSat 11am-10pm\r\nSun 11-7pm","timezoneId":"America\/Indiana\/Indianapolis","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kyDYlq","name":"Staghorn Octoberfest","nameDisplay":"Staghorn Octoberfest","description":"100% Natural - Great Midwest barleys, the world's most expensive hops, fresh yeast from Germany, and clear Wisconsin water make our Staghorn Octoberfest \"Wisconsin's Real Red.\" You will find absolutely no additives, preservatives, or artificial agents of any kind in this bier.\r\n\r\nBrewed using the time honored methods and an extra slow lager to release the smooth flavor of our roasted malts.

Steadily increasing demand and investments in higher production capacity have led to a growth in sales volumes and made the Stallhagen brand well-known to beer-lovers generally, not just the growing flock of experts and connoisseurs.","website":"http:\/\/www.stallhagen.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-22 21:58:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SffK5k","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Getav\u00e4gen 196","region":"Godby","postalCode":"22410","latitude":60.2299259,"longitude":19.9879698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","updateDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","timezoneId":"Europe\/Mariehamn","country":{"isoCode":"FI","name":"FINLAND","displayName":"Finland","isoThree":"FIN","numberCode":246,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fYl8kM","name":"Stallion","nameDisplay":"Stallion","description":"This premium bitter has a distinctly malty character with a hint of nuttiness while the enhanced hopping rate recalls for many the good old days of a true Yorkshire bitter.

In ancient Egypt, beer was for everyone: young, old, rich, poor, women, and men. Khonso Im Heb is the first official large-scale brewer of record whose beer was enjoyed by all in the Kingdom. The name - Khonso Brewing Company - was selected by our great community which has been a part of our journey from that first brew.\r\n\r\nKhonso is founded by three friends: Kevin Downing, Corby Hannah, and William Teasley. One evening in 2013, Kevin and William were having a dads\u2019 night out drinking imported beer when the idea of launching a brewery was shared, and the seeds of Khonso were planted. Corby and Kevin had already had this conversation during their younger years, and the three men, armed with a homebrew kit, some basic equipment, and their passion for beer, began their brewing journey as Brothers That Brew. Nine years of combined all-grain home brewing experience (nearly 750 gallons brewed), flavor experimentation, and conversations with regional and local brewers helped Khonso to take root.","website":"http:\/\/khonsobrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WOZf7Q\/upload_yuma9P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WOZf7Q\/upload_yuma9P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WOZf7Q\/upload_yuma9P-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WOZf7Q\/upload_yuma9P-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WOZf7Q\/upload_yuma9P-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-12 20:12:36","updateDate":"2018-12-12 20:12:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kucnxp","name":"Khonso Brewing Company","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30303","website":"http:\/\/khonsobrewing.com\/","latitude":33.755711,"longitude":-84.3883717,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-12 20:14:42","updateDate":"2018-12-12 20:14:42","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EEd0cs","name":"Standing Stone India Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Standing Stone India Pale Ale","description":"This unfiltered ale retains a medium maltiness and body and features a flowery hop perfume and pleasant bitterness.","availableId":3,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:17","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
