I don't know that we recognized at the time that it was a life altering event; but, mostly out of desire to have more mead in our lives that measured up to the quality we had experienced from them we decided to start making our own.  Having no local meadmakers to draw from, this gave us the luxury of being unafraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients not associated with meads.  Some experiments failed and others worked great, all had a powerful influence on how we saw mead and what we thought mead could be.\r\nLike any hobby we dove face first into meadmaking.  Our goal was simple, to create memorable experiences through mead using locally produced ingredients to the extent possible.  Soon we were sharing those meads with friends and they shared them with others. I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Azl4VA","name":"Sheep Shagger Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Sheep Shagger Scotch Ale","description":"Sheep Shagger Scotch Ale is rich, malty and full-bodied.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.9","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.066","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"4MVtcc","name":"The Bruery","nameShortDisplay":"The Bruery","description":"A boutique craft brewery located in Orange County, California specializing in experimental and barrel aged beer.

French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"lBKttb","name":"Winchester Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Winchester","description":"Good Beer for Good People","website":"http:\/\/www.winchesterbrewingcompany.webs.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lBKttb\/upload_MO7qhE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lBKttb\/upload_MO7qhE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lBKttb\/upload_MO7qhE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lBKttb\/upload_MO7qhE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lBKttb\/upload_MO7qhE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:53:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"iLlMCb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1950 Abrams Creek Dr","locality":"Winchester","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22601","website":"http:\/\/winchesterbrewingcompany.webs.com\/","latitude":39.1639505,"longitude":-78.1697809,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:54:43","updateDate":"2014-11-03 12:52:53","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
