No yeast was artificially added to the wort, but was exposed for two days to the open air in one of our plastic tunnels at the Noordhoek Ostrich Farm. First fermentation took place in second hand sherry oak casks for six weeks. 200 grams of  Northern cherries per litre and the Roeseleire yeast strain were added after six months, provoking a new fermentation process. Eight months later, we pumped over the young ale to oak casks and let it mature for another 3 years. This project was realized after a tasting of the same recipe Urbain once made 20 years ago and was barrel aging in his garage in De Panne eversince and while he was in Africa and forgot all about it. As this is a very limited version, this ale will not be suitable for export but rather for sale at the farm when available.","abv":"7","styleId":170,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 23:16:35","updateDate":"2018-05-18 18:26:19","style":{"id":170,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wild Beer","shortName":"Wild Beer","description":"Wild Beers are any range of color.

Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"ZKLrEQ","name":"Choice Bros Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Choice Bros","description":"Choice Bros are known for their innovative, experimental and occasional mad beers.  \r\nWith balance and a respect for both malt & hops, the beers created by the Bros have been extremely well received, broadening horizons of many drinkers along the way.","website":"http:\/\/www.choicebros.co.nz\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZKLrEQ\/upload_J96cNK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 17:42:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"RTwp27","name":"Choice Bros Brewing - HUSK","streetAddress":"62 Ghuznee St","extendedAddress":"Te Aro","region":"Wellington","postalCode":"6011","phone":"64 4-282 0583","website":"http:\/\/huskbar.co.nz\/brewery\/","latitude":-41.2929556,"longitude":174.7751361,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 17:47:03","updateDate":"2018-07-17 17:47:32","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"8:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-8:00am-10:00pm,thu-8:00am-11:00pm,fri-8:00am-12:00am,sat-9:00am-12:00am,sun-9:00am-10:00pm,mon-8:00am-10:00pm,tue-8:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"60J5C9","name":"Strutter","nameDisplay":"Strutter","description":"BBA Imperial IPA w\/ Chamomile, Rose Petals, Juniper, & Honey.","abv":"10.2","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/60J5C9\/upload_JMrPJh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/60J5C9\/upload_JMrPJh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/60J5C9\/upload_JMrPJh-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/60J5C9\/upload_JMrPJh-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/60J5C9\/upload_JMrPJh-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/60J5C9\/upload_JMrPJh-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:34:00","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:49:35","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

His great grandparents were bootleggers in Detroit, running booze from Canada, who also ran a blind pig speakeasy out of their basement. Detroit police (including the Chief) were their main clientele. His great grandmother also made beer in her kitchen for the guys at the brickyard where she worked.\r\n\r\nNathan's grandfather Cecil -- rail worker, 17-year Ford employee turned weird angry recluse -- left Detroit for Hillsdale, MI to start farming. Cecil started brewing in the early 80's, naming beers after the things that inspired the recipes and included ingredients he grew or foraged. \r\n\r\nAfter some frustration with trying to break into brewing, Nathan started Bitter Old Fecker, working under Cecil as an apprentice. During the start up process, Nathan took a job as an assistant brewer at Grizzly Peak, leaving after 18 months to focus efforts on Bitter Old Fecker exclusively. \r\n\r\nNathan and Cecil produce high gravity, bold beers brewed in a \"rustic\" style. No automatic equipment. Kettles, mash tuns, etc., stirred by hand in a brewery that can literally produce beer without the use of electricity. All beers are barrel-aged and include non traditional, foraged and locally sourced ingredients. All malt and hops are 100% US grown. His first brew, introduced in the Summer of 2013, is called Strutter, named after a nasty old rooster on Cecil's farm. Darlin', Kaplan, and Jet are brews that are soon to follow.","website":"https:\/\/bitteroldfeckerrusticales.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:33:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:00:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"YM4WZUXDTR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SMLKXz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12855 East Highway 12","locality":"Chelsea","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48118","phone":"(734) 444-5201","website":"http:\/\/drinkoldfecker.com","latitude":42.2986578,"longitude":-83.9820734,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:44:43","updateDate":"2019-05-22 20:03:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"29kjUL","name":"Stryker","nameDisplay":"Stryker","abv":"10.8","availableId":2,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-15 15:53:13","updateDate":"2015-12-15 15:53:13","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

In 2008, they opened a production brewery about 1 mile from their brewpub allowing them to triple production, take on more accounts locally, and distribute some beer in 4 more states.","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:42:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EXYPHWC9ZO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vuehNG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"724 4th Street","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95404","phone":"707-545-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.4414632,"longitude":-122.7117124,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2016-08-22 12:45:05","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Pxy2bv","name":"Production Facility","streetAddress":"1812 Ferdinand Ct","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95404","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.421129,"longitude":-122.709695,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-13 11:55:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6MGG2V","name":"STUART Ale","nameDisplay":"STUART Ale","description":"A lighter refreshing ale.","abv":"4.5","styleId":108,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6MGG2V\/upload_cw4i5J-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6MGG2V\/upload_cw4i5J-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6MGG2V\/upload_cw4i5J-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6MGG2V\/upload_cw4i5J-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6MGG2V\/upload_cw4i5J-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6MGG2V\/upload_cw4i5J-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-29 18:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-18 03:20:15","style":{"id":108,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Session Beer","shortName":"Session","description":"Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo .
