Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....","website":"http:\/\/www.easternshorebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:21:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7NU39JD4ZQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wW6rQJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"605 S.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2\/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer. We are small but hungry\u2026we mean thirsty.","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:26:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6EMUTIVHSQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1irs0u","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"234 Carpenter Street","locality":"Greenport","region":"New York","postalCode":"11944","phone":"631-477-6681","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open for Tastings\/Growlers\/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","latitude":41.1024718,"longitude":-72.3589459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Open for Tastings\/Growlers\/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"759SvF","name":"Spring Twist","nameDisplay":"Spring Twist","description":"Now in its 4th year, celebrate the start of Spring with the return of our special amber ale (4.2% abv) with a fresh citrus kick.","abv":"4.2","availableId":5,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/759SvF\/upload_TVUDlj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/759SvF\/upload_TVUDlj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/759SvF\/upload_TVUDlj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/759SvF\/upload_TVUDlj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/759SvF\/upload_TVUDlj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/759SvF\/upload_TVUDlj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-12 13:05:14","updateDate":"2015-12-16 17:51:10","available":{"id":5,"name":"Spring","description":"Available during the spring months."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Each of our beers is associated with the dogs from the kennel as a tribute to the loyalty and companionship that defined each of them.\r\n\r\nWhile not in our original plans, Black Husky began getting calls from bars and restaurants in Milwaukee to see if they could purchase our beers.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 22 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"COZL0NR6V3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","timezoneId":"America\/Anchorage","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FaWHEA","name":"Spruce It Up","nameDisplay":"Spruce It Up","description":"Brown porter with juniper and spruce.
