Visit our Pubhouse in Bigfork for a fresh, locally farmed, seasonal menu featuring daily specials and a wide range of food entrees such as in-house smoked meats, seafood, our famous clam chowder, and homemade desserts.\r\n\r\nThe Flathead Lake Brewing Company started in 2004 in Woods Bay, Montana. Our owner Greg Johnston has two very specific goals. The first: to make the best beer ever. The second: to have fun doing it. Naming the brewery wasn\u2019t hard. FLBC overlooks the shores of the largest freshwater lake in the West \u2013 and we would argue the most beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 we were honored with becoming the youngest brewery ever to win not just one, but two, World Beer Cup awards. Our brewery brought home a Bronze medal for our Peg Leg Porter and a Silver medal for our Mutiny Stout.\r\n\r\nWe at FLBC work hard, play harder, and do everything to the highest standard. For us, it\u2019s about being leaders in the beer industry, it\u2019s about supporting local and environmental sustainability, and it\u2019s about contributing to the community that has so graciously embraced us. Most importantly for our crew, it\u2019s about making beer and food that we are proud of. We love what we do, and we hope you do too.\r\n\r\nMontana is the Treasure State, and we are Montana\u2019s Liquid Treasure.","website":"http:\/\/www.flatheadlakebrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:05:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8NJ793DXHU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CHRyRk","name":"Woods Bay","streetAddress":"26008 East Lake Shore Rte.","locality":"Bigfork","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59911","phone":"406-837-0353","website":"http:\/\/www.flatheadlakebrewing.com\/","latitude":47.998205,"longitude":-114.045602,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-06-04 18:45:20","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XF4JJ4","name":"Missoula","streetAddress":"424 North Higgins","locality":"Missoula","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59802","phone":"406-542-3847","website":"http:\/\/www.flbcofmissoula.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Friday    3:00 to 12:00 \r\nSaturday 11:00 to 12:00 \r\nSunday 11:00 to 10:00","latitude":46.873384,"longitude":-113.99322,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-15 21:34:43","updateDate":"2015-06-05 16:11:31","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Friday    3:00 to 12:00 \r\nSaturday 11:00 to 12:00 \r\nSunday 11:00 to 10:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"3JNh3v","name":"FLBC Pubhouse","streetAddress":"116 Holt Dr.","locality":"Bigfork","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59911","phone":"4068370085","latitude":48.0642939,"longitude":-114.083249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-04 18:35:45","updateDate":"2015-06-05 16:11:31","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kJeQfU","name":"Stout","nameDisplay":"Stout","description":"Dark and rich, this full bodied brew is not from the bottom of the barrel.

The roasted character will dominate the first sip, but easing right in behind it will be hints of coffee, vanilla, chocolate and other wonderful toasted flavors and aromas.  \r\n\r\nThe next time you're at the lodge don't be afraid to come over to the dark side.

The main product produced at the brewery is Guinness Draft.\r\n\r\nLeased for 9,000 years in 1759 by Arthur Guinness at \u00a345 per year, St. James's Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since.

Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.\r\n\r\nThere is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse.","website":"http:\/\/www.guinness.com\/","established":"1759","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9RsQkk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"109 James's Street","locality":"Dublin City","region":"Dublin","postalCode":"8","website":"http:\/\/www.guinness.com\/","latitude":53.34309,"longitude":-6.290799,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","yearOpened":"1759","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-08-29 13:27:58","country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qemijM","name":"Stout Ale","nameDisplay":"Stout Ale","description":"Black, roasty, coffee tones, full flavored","abv":"5.5","ibu":"35","glasswareId":5,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:18","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:41","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels.
