Well it started as a business venture Tim basically decided the town and hopefully his pocket needed a micro brewery, (shallow I know, it gets better). Simon wanted in. As Tim had never brewed beer and Simon was a very casual brewer it was deemed necessary that Tim has a basic understanding of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Tim's world was getting complicated... As everything fell apart around them what started as a requirement to start a brewery became a passion that filled days and nights in the shed. Micro brewery plans were put to one side and life went on. We never stopped brewing! Our equipment grew, our knowledge blossomed, books were read courses attended and through the toughest times in our lives brewing was a constant. We created new beers, new flavours, we made beers that will never be repeated and some that never should have existed in the first place.\r\n\r\nYears after our plans for world domination had ended and our brewery had been all but forgotten we realised that we had the tools, knowledge and passion to make this thing happen. Without knowing it was happening we had become beer activists, beer judges and most importantly quality craft beer brewers!\r\n\r\nWe will brew great beer, and we have seen this dream to the end.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-09 19:06:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TJCONK5EHD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5tw2Iw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"216 S Alameda St","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90013","phone":"310-329-8881","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","latitude":34.0466054,"longitude":-118.2378181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"misc":[{"id":1233,"name":"Lime Juice","category":"misc","categoryDisplay":"Miscellaneous","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:08:29"},{"id":1991,"name":"Sriracha","category":"misc","categoryDisplay":"Miscellaneous","createDate":"2015-08-10 16:52:10"},{"id":1990,"name":"Tomato juice","category":"misc","categoryDisplay":"Miscellaneous","createDate":"2015-08-10 16:51:56"},{"id":1992,"name":"Agave","category":"misc","categoryDisplay":"Miscellaneous","createDate":"2015-08-10 16:53:03"},{"id":1993,"name":"Pickled banana pepper juice","category":"misc","categoryDisplay":"Miscellaneous","createDate":"2015-08-10 16:53:17"},{"id":1517,"name":"Worcestershire Sauce","category":"misc","categoryDisplay":"Miscellaneous","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:08:54","updateDate":"2015-08-10 16:55:40"}]}},{"id":"QLUOoO","name":"SRP #3 (Dry Hopped Sour Ale)","nameDisplay":"SRP #3 (Dry Hopped Sour Ale)","description":"Our SRP (Sour Resin Project) series defies brewing boundaries.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

The brewery was located in north end of Stillwater near the Tamarack House. Like many early pioneer breweries of the valley, it served the local loggers of the area. As Stillwater grew the St. Croix Brewery sold and its operations ceased in the latter part of the 19th century. The buildings and land were used for various mercantile interests until the early 1950\u2019s when it was razed to make room for the Highway 95 realignment. In 1995 the St. Croix Brewing Company was once again reborn by a local homebrewer and came to be known as the St. Croix Beer Company. Introduced that year was the American Original St. Croix Maple Ale. In 2003 Tod Fyten purchased the St. Croix Beer Company and renamed it the St. Croix Brewing Company, LLC. Currently headquartered in St. Paul, plans are to once again build a brewery in the St. Croix River Valley.","website":"http:\/\/www.stcroixbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5ovCvP\/upload_Knq4zv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5ovCvP\/upload_Knq4zv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5ovCvP\/upload_Knq4zv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5ovCvP\/upload_Knq4zv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5ovCvP\/upload_Knq4zv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2019-08-14 13:44:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"d7oWZX","name":"Main Brewery","extendedAddress":"PO Box 16545","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","phone":"651-387-0708","website":"http:\/\/www.stcroixbeer.com\/","latitude":44.91298,"longitude":-93.172109,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-02-17 15:34:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0YJuJ8","name":"St Edmunds Head","nameDisplay":"St Edmunds Head","description":"An annual brew to celebrate St Edmund\u2019s Day on 20th November\r\nA dark, strong and malty ale.
