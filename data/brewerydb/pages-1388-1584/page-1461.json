If you keep up with the popular soap called \u2018Thuis\u2019 (\u2018Home\u2019), broadcast daily on Flemish television, you will know all about the adventures of its main character, Eddy Van Noteghem. One fine day, Eddy, who is known for his love of beer, unearths a beer recipe compiled by his late Dad. He invites his group of friends to start home brewing.. The Slurfke is born. The hobby brewers gain first-hand experience of the brewing trade and soon find out it involves far more than they had thought. The Slurfke is a success; the friends purchase a brewery and set up their own business. However, the story does not end well. The friends argue and their joint endeavour is no more. This fictitious beer has now become a reality. Numerous \u2018Thuisfans\u2019, as fans of the soap are called, wanted to know where they could taste this beer. This inspired Castle Brewery Van Honsebrouck to start brewing it based on the original recipe from the television series. The name \u2018Slurfke\u2019 means little trunk. It is a robust craft beer of the \u2018dubbel\u2019 type, dark in colour and perfect as a degustation beer. The addition of roast malts not only provides the dark colour, but also the aromas and tastes of caramel and coffee. The proprietary yeast accounts for fruity aromas of banana and vanilla. \u201cEverybody loves our Slurfke.\u201d Xavier Van Honsebrouck","abv":"8.5","styleId":58,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-11-01 01:01:02","updateDate":"2018-11-01 11:05:39","style":{"id":58,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","shortName":"Belgian Dubbel","description":"This medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale has a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma.

In 1930 they build a new malt house and a foeder room and in 1937 a new brewing room, a fermentation room, a tank room and a bottling hall. Their focus still is on the traditional low fermentation beers: bock, export and lager.\r\nLuc, the son of Paul, goes to brewery school and learns the trade as an apprentice in Germany and Wallonia.\r\nLuc takes over in 1953, changes the name in brewery Vanhonsebrouck and decides to stop brewing lager and focuses on \u2018old Flemish brown\u2019, Bacchus.\r\nIn 1957 he starts with lambic and later on with Gueuze and Kriek under the name Saint Louis. Brewery Vanhonsebrouck becomes the second largest brewery of Gueuze, thanks to the shirt sponsoring of FC Bruges, European soccer finalist in 1976 and 1978. The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt.\r\nIn 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer\u2019s uprising against French occupation in 1798.\r\nIn 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched. It starts with \u2018Donker\u2019, than \u2018Tripel\u2019, \u2018Rouge\u2019 and \u2018Blond\u2019.\r\nIn 2009, the 5th generation, Xavier Van Honsebrouck, takes over.\r\nHis first achievement is the \u2018Cuv\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau\u2019.\r\nIn 2012 the high exclusive Trignac follows and in 2013 Kasteel Hoppy.\r\nIn commemoration of a 100 years World War I, \u2018Passchendaele\u2019, a Belgian Top Blond, with only 5.2\u00b0 alcohol is launched in 2013. A donation is offered to the community of Zonnebeke, to contribute in the preservation of its remnants of the Great War.\r\nDue to the fast growing export, the actual brewery is almost on its full capacity.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan.

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.","website":"http:\/\/www.yazoobrew.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:01:38","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OUQP3ZRANL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"preZog","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"900 River Bluff Drive","locality":"Madison","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37115","phone":"615-891-4649","website":"http:\/\/www.yazoobrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday are Growler fills only","latitude":36.275565,"longitude":-86.6865119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2019-08-12 15:20:38","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-8:00pm,fri-4:00pm-8:00pm,sat-2:00pm-8:00pm,wed-4:00pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wednesday are Growler fills only","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ir3p93","name":"Slye Rye","nameDisplay":"Slye Rye","abv":"4.9","ibu":"28","styleId":117,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-04 20:02:39","updateDate":"2016-01-04 20:02:39","style":{"id":117,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Rye Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Rye Ale","description":"Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"yVfXgN","name":"Fox Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Fox","website":"http:\/\/www.foxbrewco.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yVfXgN\/upload_imMTwZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yVfXgN\/upload_imMTwZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yVfXgN\/upload_imMTwZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yVfXgN\/upload_imMTwZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yVfXgN\/upload_imMTwZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-29 20:54:22","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:35:26","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZO3XTC71LH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"SHoHvA","name":"Fox Brewing","streetAddress":"103 S 11th Street","locality":"West Des Moines","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50265","phone":"515-635-0323","website":"http:\/\/www.foxbrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thurs: 4:00 - 10:00\r\nFri: 4:00 - 11:00\r\nSat: 12:00 - 11:00\r\nSun: 12:00 - 7:00","latitude":41.5686256,"longitude":-93.7190448,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-29 20:56:12","updateDate":"2016-01-04 21:44:17","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thurs: 4:00 - 10:00\r\nFri: 4:00 - 11:00\r\nSat: 12:00 - 11:00\r\nSun: 12:00 - 7:00","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lQnJj4","name":"SM Tangelo Saison","nameDisplay":"SM Tangelo Saison","description":"Farmhouse style wheat ale brewed with tangelos from Agritopia.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 22 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"COZL0NR6V3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","timezoneId":"America\/Anchorage","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"muOS4K","name":"Smackintosh","nameDisplay":"Smackintosh","description":"POW!

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-03-14 13:33:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"fz3g3i","name":"Pipeworks Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Pipeworks","description":"Pipeworks began, as many breweries do, in the stove top kettles and plastic-bucket fermenters of the home brewer.

After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"wfAwfx","name":"BrewDog","nameShortDisplay":"BrewDog","description":"BrewDog is a Scottish craft brewery located in the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBrewDog was founded in 2006 by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"wfAwfx","name":"BrewDog","nameShortDisplay":"BrewDog","description":"BrewDog is a Scottish craft brewery located in the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBrewDog was founded in 2006 by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie.
