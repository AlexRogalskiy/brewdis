This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"iodDki","name":"Three Floyds Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Three Floyds","description":"Three Floyds Brewing Company LLC was founded in 1996 by brothers Nick and Simon with their father Mike Floyd.

Our Head Brewer frequently traveled to Europe over the past couple years.  He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.  As we pay homage to these great and historic beers, we\u2019ll add an American Flair that will be embraced in the Carolinas and beyond.","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:58:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2L946UCIGR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oGBBGF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2921 N Tyron St","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28206","phone":"(704) 900-6851","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","latitude":35.25157,"longitude":-80.812472,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2017-03-16 15:19:21","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm,mon-4:00pm-9:00pm,tue-4:00pm-9:00pm,wed-4:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qKRIcL","name":"Special Bitter","nameDisplay":"Special Bitter","styleId":4,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-30 14:04:00","updateDate":"2016-09-30 14:04:00","style":{"id":4,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Special Bitter or Best Bitter","shortName":"Special Bitter","description":"Special bitter is more robust than ordinary bitter. It has medium body and medium residual malt sweetness. It is deep gold to copper colored. Hop bitterness should be medium and absent of harshness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"28","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.1","abvMax":"4.8","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"KbQuTv","name":"Calfkiller Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Calfkiller","website":"http:\/\/www.calfkillerbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KbQuTv\/upload_04zGGh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KbQuTv\/upload_04zGGh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KbQuTv\/upload_04zGGh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KbQuTv\/upload_04zGGh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KbQuTv\/upload_04zGGh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2019-01-23 14:55:25","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1KR0U3N8VQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WGigar","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1839 Blue Springs Rd","locality":"Sparta","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"38583","phone":"931-739-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.calfkillerbeer.com\/","latitude":35.944867,"longitude":-85.421242,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
