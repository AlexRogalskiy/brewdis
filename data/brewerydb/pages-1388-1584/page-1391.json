Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

The farm is a historic site, dating back to the Civil War, and is officially known as \u201cThe Encampment\u201d as the farm was used as a camp for Union soldiers leading up to the battle of Antietam.\r\nFollowing the Civil War, a fire destroyed most of the farmhouse. It was rebuilt in the 1890\u2019s on its original foundation. Today, the farmhouse, adjacent carriage house, and Civil War-era barn foundation still stand on the property. Additional buildings, such as the cider house and barns, were added later, designed to maintain the historic appearance and integrity of the property and surrounding area.\r\nRob Miller, his wife, Patty Power, and their three children moved to the farm in 2001. Prior to the Millers, the farm had never been used as an apple orchard. However, having always been cider fans (both fresh and hard cider) and with the farm located in a prime region to grow apples, they decided to enter the cider-making world.\r\nThe operation has been a family-affair from the beginning: fifteen of the Millers\u2019 extended family came to plant the initial 1,000 trees one weekend in the spring of 2001. By 2006, the trees were producing enough fruit to make the first batches of fresh cider. At this point, construction on the cider house commenced.\r\nBy 2008, the cider house was officially completed and approved to be open for business. During this time, numerous home-brew cider-makers discovered the farm and would buy fresh cider to take home and ferment into hard cider. Tim Rose, one of the home-brewers, had come back several times with refreshing cider and well-researched advice for the Millers\u2019 cider making. Tim was invited to join the family-owned and operated farm as the official cidermaker for Distillery Lane Ciderwork. He has since moved from carboys in his basement to his own building with stainless steel tanks!\r\nOpened for business as an official Maryland winery in 2010, Distillery Lane Ciderworks took its name from the rich history of the area. The whole valley was dotted with beer and whiskey-producing distilleries up until Prohibition. The remains of one of these distilleries can still be seen today down the road from the farm in the woods.\r\nDistillery Lane Ciderworks was the first licensed cidery in Maryland. More trees have been planted since 2001 and the orchard is now nine acres (over 3,000 trees)!\r\nSince 2010, the business has been featured in articles in media outlets such as The Washington Post and on the hit television show, \u201cDrinking Made Easy,\u201d where the host, Zane Lamprey, and his stuffed monkey, Pleepleus, visited the farm and tasted some of the cider.
