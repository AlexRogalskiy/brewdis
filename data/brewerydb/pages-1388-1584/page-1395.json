Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Saranac Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Saranac","description":"Our attention to detail and uncompromising commitment to quality represent the signature trademark of the Matt Brewing Company and our award-winning Saranac Beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.saranac.com\/","established":"1888","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:23:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VNK3S4TLE1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"RQ96Nf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"811 Edward Street","locality":"Utica","region":"New York","postalCode":"13502","phone":"800-690-3181-x222","website":"http:\/\/www.saranac.com\/","latitude":43.104492,"longitude":-75.245249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1888","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HWad7H","name":"Saranac Pumpkin Ale","nameDisplay":"Saranac Pumpkin Ale","description":"Saranac Pumpkin Ale is brewed with Pumpkin, Cinnamon, Allspice, Cloves, Ginger and Vanilla.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Saranac Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Saranac","description":"Our attention to detail and uncompromising commitment to quality represent the signature trademark of the Matt Brewing Company and our award-winning Saranac Beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.saranac.com\/","established":"1888","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qs29uy\/upload_xLOm1R-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:23:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VNK3S4TLE1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"RQ96Nf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"811 Edward Street","locality":"Utica","region":"New York","postalCode":"13502","phone":"800-690-3181-x222","website":"http:\/\/www.saranac.com\/","latitude":43.104492,"longitude":-75.245249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1888","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
