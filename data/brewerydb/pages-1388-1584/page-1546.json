The only thing more balanced than the aroma is the flavor, offering subtle malt sweetness on either side of the hops profile, and closes with a crisp, hoppy finish.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"availableId":6,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-29 16:29:59","updateDate":"2017-07-18 13:54:43","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob\u2019s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of \u201cbeer mix\u201d and a bucket to brew.

The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"j0mzN3","name":"Barreled Souls","nameShortDisplay":"Barreled Souls","website":"http:\/\/barreledsouls.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/j0mzN3\/upload_YnfPrD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/j0mzN3\/upload_YnfPrD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/j0mzN3\/upload_YnfPrD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/j0mzN3\/upload_YnfPrD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/j0mzN3\/upload_YnfPrD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-04 19:30:57","updateDate":"2019-02-26 14:24:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q2XY8VU0BP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ySo6qj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"743 Portland Road","locality":"Saco","region":"Maine","website":"http:\/\/barreledsouls.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thurs 4pm-10pm \r\nFri 4pm-12am\r\nSat 12pm-12am\r\nSun 12pm-10pm","latitude":43.523638,"longitude":-70.4274727,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-04 19:30:57","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:31:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon-Thurs 4pm-10pm \r\nFri 4pm-12am\r\nSat 12pm-12am\r\nSun 12pm-10pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fspjx6","name":"Summer Knights","nameDisplay":"Summer Knights","abv":"5","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-10 11:59:50","updateDate":"2018-11-06 20:09:58","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WtMfgN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","latitude":40.2795364,"longitude":-75.2143123,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:09:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PwC0Ng","name":"Summer Landscape","nameDisplay":"Summer Landscape","description":"American Pale Lager with spelt.","abv":"5.5","styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-10 16:33:10","updateDate":"2018-06-12 17:50:57","style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

Only Tettnanger hops grown in the Tettnang should be referred to as Tettnang Tettnanger. It is prized for its spicy, floral noble character, and is genetically very similar, if not identical, to the Saaz cultivar grown in the Czech Republic. Hops described as \"Tettnanger\" are also grown in the United States, Switzerland, and Australia, but these American Tettnanger, Swiss Tettnanger, and Australian Tettnanger hops are generally not be the true Tettnanger cultivar, but are thought to be Fuggle or a descendant of Fuggle. Since \"Tettnanger\" cultivation is traditional in Switzerland, it is most likely that these Swiss \"Tettnanger\" were never Tettnanger hops to begin with, but that rhizomes were exported under that name. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":3.5,"alphaAcidMax":3.5,"betaAcidMin":3.5,"betaAcidMax":5,"humuleneMin":20,"humuleneMax":25,"caryophylleneMin":6,"caryophylleneMax":10,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":29,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":25,"farneseneMin":12,"farneseneMax":16,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}},{"id":"anQdRk","name":"Summer Lovin\u2019","nameDisplay":"Summer Lovin\u2019","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-24 20:56:10","updateDate":"2015-07-24 20:56:10","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building.

Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:20:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q8W2M631AI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fdKkkP","name":"Summer Rye","nameDisplay":"Summer Rye","description":"An easy drinking crisp ale, perfect for the summer heat.","abv":"5","ibu":"23","styleId":117,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fdKkkP\/upload_YOxWly-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fdKkkP\/upload_YOxWly-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fdKkkP\/upload_YOxWly-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fdKkkP\/upload_YOxWly-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fdKkkP\/upload_YOxWly-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fdKkkP\/upload_YOxWly-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-11 18:31:20","updateDate":"2015-12-16 16:59:11","style":{"id":117,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Rye Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Rye Ale","description":"Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"gF2S17","name":"Rough Draft Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Rough Draft","description":"We like beer.
