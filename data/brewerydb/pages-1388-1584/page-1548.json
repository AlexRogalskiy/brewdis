We are committed to crafting great hard cider made from fresh pressed Midwestern fruit, never concentrate.\r\n\r\nBrick River Cider is named to honor the connection between the City of St Louis and its connection to the regional rural communities.  From its early days St Louis was a major source of brick making, and the rivers carried those bricks in every direction building communities throughout our region.  Those bricks remind us that we are all connected, and we continue that tradition today bringing the fruits of the region back to the city, and crafting authentic hard ciders to celebrate with our friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe story of connections flowing back and forth with St Louis and the wider region has repeated again and again across countless families and generations.  Brick River founder Russ John\u2019s family got its start in America when his great grandfather Theodore enlisted in the Union Cavalry in 1862 at Jefferson Barracks, St Louis.  In 1869 Theodore established a homestead farm and orchards in southeast Nebraska, and the John family has been growing apples in the Midwest ever since.  Today his great grandson is proud to bring a family tradition of hard cider back to St Louis with the city\u2019s first dedicated ciderworks.\r\n\r\nBrick River Cider Company\u2019s mission is to work with regional fruit growers to craft authentic hard cider using only fresh pressed fruit juices.  Our ciders range from classic and traditional to bold and innovative, but whatever the style they are all 100% gluten free from fresh pressed regional fruit, never concentrate.  We invite you to raise a glass and connect with cider the way it should be.","website":"http:\/\/brickrivercider.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YSR8TG\/upload_lqOkGa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YSR8TG\/upload_lqOkGa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YSR8TG\/upload_lqOkGa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YSR8TG\/upload_lqOkGa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YSR8TG\/upload_lqOkGa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-15 22:59:31","updateDate":"2019-06-16 12:10:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"uhUq3V","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2000 Washington.Ave","locality":"St Louis","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63103","phone":"314.224.5046","website":"brickrivercider.com","latitude":38.6337502,"longitude":-90.2080181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-15 22:59:32","updateDate":"2019-06-16 12:10:45","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm,wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5HfPX4","name":"Summer Teath","nameDisplay":"Summer Teath","description":"Summer Teath is a 4.1% ABV summer IPA brewed with American 2-row barley malt, red wheat malt and light crystal malt and fermented with our house ale yeast.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dkglC6","name":"Summertime Rye","nameDisplay":"Summertime Rye","description":"Summertime Rye is a crafty combination of Rye, Barley, and Wheat Malts carefully dosed with Citra Hops in the kettle and the fermenter.
