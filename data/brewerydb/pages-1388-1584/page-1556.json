Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"e40kjr","name":"Yellow Dog Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Yellow Dog","description":"Yellow Dog Brewing is a family-run brewery focused on producing high quality locally crafted beer for everyone to enjoy.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty.

Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AH8gWh","name":"Super Villain!","nameDisplay":"Super Villain!","abv":"8.9","ibu":"80","srmId":28,"styleId":28,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AH8gWh\/upload_ZrdoFf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AH8gWh\/upload_ZrdoFf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AH8gWh\/upload_ZrdoFf-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AH8gWh\/upload_ZrdoFf-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AH8gWh\/upload_ZrdoFf-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AH8gWh\/upload_ZrdoFf-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.08","createDate":"2013-02-22 12:59:05","updateDate":"2015-12-17 01:20:11","srm":{"id":28,"name":"28","hex":"6A0E00"},"style":{"id":28,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale","shortName":"American\/Belgian Dark","description":"These beers must portray the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in fruity and big Belgian-Style ales - These beers are not traditional Belgian styles which are already defined.

Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"IqPdv8","name":"Burnt City Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Burnt City Brewing","description":"We brew and sell tasty beer in Chicago and the surrounding area.
