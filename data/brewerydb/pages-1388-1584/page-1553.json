If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

Low in carbon dioxide, these hazy beers are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Cloudiness is acceptable. These beers are quite dry and light bodied. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambicstyle\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet. Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8.1","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:34"},"breweries":[{"id":"02Ne4w","name":"Iron Hill Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Iron Hill","description":"Welcome to Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, where you'll find fine handcrafted beers, creative yet informal cuisine, and friendly, attentive service in a casual, upscale atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe're passionate about producing distinctive, full-flavored handcrafted beers, accompanied by fresh\u2013from\u2013scratch New American cuisine in a comfortable, casual atmosphere.

We aim to create elegant ales that are experimental and unique, balanced with complex flavors and aromas. From the recipes to the artwork on the labels, everything is designed by ourselves and our good friends.\r\n\r\nGypsy brewing means we are brewers without a permanent brewing home. We travel to other breweries, use their equipment to make something special, and bring the results back home to share. Think of Grimm Ales as a band, and the host brewery as a recording studio. We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).\r\n\r\nEach batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!\r\n\r\nExpect our first beers to pop up in New York in summer 2013. Some of our first batches might be a crisp, spicy rye abbey ale, a rich, golden Belgian tripel, and a hop-focused pale ale made with clean, slightly acidic champagne yeast.","website":"http:\/\/grimmales.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 13:04:26","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:12:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U8CLHEZ0RV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TIn5vy","name":"Main Office","extendedAddress":"PO Box 150472","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11215","phone":"(678) 895-1489","website":"http:\/\/grimmales.com\/","latitude":40.6681669,"longitude":-73.9800645,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 13:05:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"E8p0D8","name":"Sunshine & Opportunity","nameDisplay":"Sunshine & Opportunity","description":"Mixed fermentation saison, aged in oak barrels and dry-hopped.","abv":"6.25","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-03-20 02:29:45","updateDate":"2017-03-20 02:29:45","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
