This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.

Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin.

Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"21","abvMin":"5.6","abvMax":"8.6","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.

It\u2019s a place where we build our hopes and dreams, storing them on the wall neat as garden tools. Really, the garage is a hub. A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing. This brewery celebrates determination, knowledge, and the humble pride we wave like a battle flag.","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonBrewingCompany\/app_100265896690345?ref=page_internal","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:09:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:36:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"G851P7EZKA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"JZyJiP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 W. 7th","locality":"Covington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41011","phone":"859-261-5600","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","latitude":39.0829077,"longitude":-84.5109181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 17:33:55","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:29:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LgDR9B","name":"Braxton Labs","streetAddress":"95 Riviera Dr.","locality":"Bellevue","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41073","phone":"859-291-0036","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonLabs\/","latitude":39.1001948,"longitude":-84.4877355,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","updateDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"B4xa2W","name":"Spotlight Rye IPA","nameDisplay":"Spotlight Rye IPA (2015)","description":"Each spring, we will turn the spotlight on our talented brewers as they team up to create a truly special India Pale Ale.

Sometimes the percentage of wheat is even higher. \"Hefe\" means \"with yeast,\" hence the beer's unfiltered and cloudy appearance. The particular ale yeast used produces unique esters and phenols of banana and cloves with an often dry and tart edge, some spiciness, and notes of bubblegum or apples. Hefeweizens are typified by little hop bitterness, and a moderate level of alcohol. Often served with a lemon wedge (popularized by Americans), to cut the wheat or yeasty edge, some may find this to be either a flavorful snap or an insult that can damage the beer's taste and head retention.","srmId":3,"availableId":2,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/njc8T3\/upload_ZABNu2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/njc8T3\/upload_ZABNu2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/njc8T3\/upload_ZABNu2-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/njc8T3\/upload_ZABNu2-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/njc8T3\/upload_ZABNu2-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/njc8T3\/upload_ZABNu2-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-03 15:12:47","updateDate":"2019-06-04 19:53:45","srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
