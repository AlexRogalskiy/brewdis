It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N39Q0L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2004 Capitol Avenue","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95814","phone":"916-448-7032","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","latitude":38.573116,"longitude":-121.480958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1987","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eVrBii","name":"STOUT","nameDisplay":"STOUT","description":"The strong presence of dark chocolate is nicely balanced with hints of roasted barley and english hops.

In 2010, he established the Vail Valley\u2019s first production brewery, with headquarters and a kickin\u2019 Taproom in Edwards. In 2015, Crazy Mountain expanded its reach to Denver, which became our production headquarters and Taproom. With a prime location in downtown\u2019s Baker Neighborhood, we offer a beautifully-remodeled tap room with 24 beers on draft and sports on TV, a clandestine speakeasy available for private buyouts, and (of course) a view of the ever-present snow-capped mountains in the near distance.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous mountain lifestyle carries over into everything we do \u2014 because our beer pairs best with adrenaline. Crazy Mountain brews craft beer with only the finest of ingredients, yielding the best tasting, crowd-pleasing ales and lagers.\r\n\r\nEach of our six-pack carriers features a character who\u2019s a particular breed of Crazy with a story to tell.

Bottled alive, to give them time to grow.","website":"http:\/\/www.thekernelbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CLVEJr\/upload_5ZkDzh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CLVEJr\/upload_5ZkDzh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CLVEJr\/upload_5ZkDzh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CLVEJr\/upload_5ZkDzh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CLVEJr\/upload_5ZkDzh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 19:07:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NWjJqD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unit 11, Dockley Road Industrial Estate","extendedAddress":"Dockley Road","locality":"London","region":"London","postalCode":"SE16 3SF","phone":"02072314516","website":"http:\/\/www.thekernelbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Saturday - 9am to 3pm","latitude":51.4957404,"longitude":-0.0692936,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 19:08:40","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Saturday - 9am to 3pm","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mdTOI7","name":"Stout","nameDisplay":"Stout","description":"The very first beer we brewed at Little Toad Creek was an Oatmeal Stout.

Founded in 2015 by Beverly residents Paul and Christen Gentile, we are focused on providing our community with fresh craft beer made with quality ingredients. We believe good beer should be enjoyed and not fussed over. Our beer is made using traditional English-style brewing methods and ingredients. Our product line includes a set of four year-round beers and small batch releases that give us a chance to try out new ideas. Our low ABV year-round beers allow you to enjoy more than one without feeling like you were hit by a truck the next day.\r\n\r\nGentile Brewing Company can be easily found in downtown Beverly, steps from the Beverly Depot MBTA station. The building at 59 Park Street was built in 1884 and originally housed Creesy Shoe Factory, among many other manufacturers over its storied 130 plus year history. Our beers pay homage to those who worked and lived in the Beverly community all of those years ago. We hope you\u2019ll come visit us soon!\r\n\r\nPaul & Christen Gentile","website":"http:\/\/gentilebrewing.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@gentilebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XXQjLP\/upload_cWkSLv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-21 13:03:12","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:10:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7WGARO9T4C","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"taYuqM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"59 Park St #1","locality":"Beverly","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01915","phone":"(978) 969-6496","website":"http:\/\/gentilebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:12:00 pm - 4:00 pm","latitude":42.5493947,"longitude":-70.8843902,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-21 13:03:13","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:10:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"4:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-8:00pm,sat-12:00pm-4:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fri:4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:12:00 pm - 4:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tYf3W8","name":"Stout","nameDisplay":"Stout","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:18","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:53","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
