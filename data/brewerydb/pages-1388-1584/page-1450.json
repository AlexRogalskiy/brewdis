Sink the Bismarck is a quadruple IPA that contains four times the hops, four times the bitterness and frozen four times to create at a staggering 41% ABV.\r\n\r\nThis is IPA amplified, the most evocative style of the craft beer resistance with the volume cranked off the scale. Kettle hopped, dry hopped then freeze hopped for a deep fruit, resinous and spicy aroma. A full out attack on your taste-buds ensues as the incredibly smooth liquid delivers  a crescendo of malt, sweet honey, hop oils and a torpedo of hop bitterness which lasts and lasts.","abv":"41","glasswareId":6,"availableId":4,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/SII4fs\/upload_f2XAEp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/SII4fs\/upload_f2XAEp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/SII4fs\/upload_f2XAEp-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/SII4fs\/upload_f2XAEp-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/SII4fs\/upload_f2XAEp-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/SII4fs\/upload_f2XAEp-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:13","updateDate":"2017-01-10 22:02:29","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

When the two of them got an opportunity to help start the first brewery in Cullman since the 1880s, they jumped at it. They along with John Dean and Brad Glenn formed the Blue Moose Brew Crew. They brewed their beers and served them at the Blue Moose Caf\u00e9 and Brewpub in 2013. The beers were a huge success. The success of this venture convinced the four friends to open their own brewery. In early 2015 Goat Island Brewing was formed.","website":"http:\/\/www.goatislandbrewing.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"mike@goatislandbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/liUGqs\/upload_h1rQ7H-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/liUGqs\/upload_h1rQ7H-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/liUGqs\/upload_h1rQ7H-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/liUGqs\/upload_h1rQ7H-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/liUGqs\/upload_h1rQ7H-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-22 18:07:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:02:57","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"T5F73HXJIO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"dAuCwE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1646-A John H Cooper Dr SE","locality":"Cullman","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35055","website":"http:\/\/www.goatislandbrewing.com\/","latitude":34.1412802,"longitude":-86.818329,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-02 13:42:21","updateDate":"2016-11-02 13:43:17","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-5:00pm-10:00pm,fri-5:00pm-10:00pm,sat-2:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UVuNsV","name":"Sir Albert's Reserve","nameDisplay":"Sir Albert's Reserve","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UVuNsV\/upload_GHbRbL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UVuNsV\/upload_GHbRbL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UVuNsV\/upload_GHbRbL-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UVuNsV\/upload_GHbRbL-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UVuNsV\/upload_GHbRbL-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UVuNsV\/upload_GHbRbL-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-12 02:27:13","updateDate":"2015-12-17 07:07:19","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.
