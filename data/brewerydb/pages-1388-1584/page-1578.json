Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"8Uwsc3","name":"Chilly Water Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Chilly Water","description":"An urban brewpub with super food infused with great music, located in Downtown Indianapolis.","website":"http:\/\/www.chillywaterbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8Uwsc3\/upload_trpOk6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8Uwsc3\/upload_trpOk6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8Uwsc3\/upload_trpOk6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8Uwsc3\/upload_trpOk6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8Uwsc3\/upload_trpOk6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-06 19:08:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:25:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HZ0VSFO1Q2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oaDD5l","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"719 Virginia Ave","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46203","phone":"(317) 964-0518","website":"http:\/\/www.chillywaterbrewing.com","latitude":39.7572649,"longitude":-86.146124,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-07 17:45:47","updateDate":"2014-09-07 17:45:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:00am-10:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AlqYLC","name":"Teapot Dome","nameDisplay":"Teapot Dome","abv":"5.5","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-03 16:36:58","updateDate":"2017-07-05 14:31:56","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Before we put the grapes into the prepared base of beer, we will remove the grapes, but leave the berry peel.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"1Lis85","name":"Oasis Texas Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Oasis Texas","description":"Producing iconic, rustic beers in the heart of the Texas Hill Country","website":"http:\/\/otxbc.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-22 14:18:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:52:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"87XFDW9O4C","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"s6xmV6","name":"Oasis Texas Brewing Company","streetAddress":"6550 Comanche Trail","extendedAddress":"Suite 301","locality":"Austin","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78732","website":"http:\/\/otxbc.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":30.4058986,"longitude":-97.8739516,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-22 14:20:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VO0mnU","name":"Technicolor Splendor","nameDisplay":"Technicolor Splendor","description":"Spelt double IPA hopped exclusively and intensely with one of our favorite hops in the entire world: Simcoe","abv":"8","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-07 20:57:53","updateDate":"2016-08-22 15:51:56","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

John Thomas Toohey and his brother James Matthew ran pubs in Melbourne (The Limerick Arms and The Great Britain) before moving to Sydney in the 1860s. They commenced brewing Tooheys Tooheys Black Old Ale in a brewery in the area of present day Darling Harbour. By 1875, demand for their beer had soared and they established The Standard Brewery in inner-city Surry Hills. In 1902, the company went public as Tooheys Limited, and commenced brewing lager (the present day Tooheys New) in 1930. In 1955, the brewery moved west to Lidcombe, where it is currently sited. In 1967, Tooheys bought competitor Miller's Brewers located in Tavener's Hill, closing the brewery in 1975.","website":"http:\/\/www.tooheysnew.com.au\/","established":"1869","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NGkXso\/upload_yrHNTc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nbraNY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29 Nyrang Street","locality":"Sydney","region":"New South Wales","phone":"1-800-308-388","website":"http:\/\/www.tooheysnew.com.au\/","latitude":-33.8523433,"longitude":151.045122,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","yearOpened":"1869","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"i92f56","name":"Ted Light Lime","nameDisplay":"Ted Light Lime","description":"Craft beer lovers publicly chastise lime-infused beers as \u201cmainstream\u201d.

Since that time, he has fallen in love with beer and brewing and felt compelled to do it professionally, and in 2012, Kenny opened Beer Hound Brewery.\r\n\r\nNot long after Beer Hound opened, friends & beer entrepreneurs Frank Becker & Rick Cash saw the potential in the great-tasting brews that were part of the Beer Hound lineup. They joined forces with Beer Hound Brewery and decided to bring the great tasting microbrews to the Town of Culpeper, Virginia.  In October of 2014, Beer Hound Brewery opened its doors as the first-ever brewery in Culpeper. Local and visiting beer enthusiasts descended upon the new establishment immediately and now the Beer Hound brand is a mainstay of the arts district in Downtown Culpeper.\r\n\r\nAll of the Beer Hound beers are named after famous hounds in movies and history, with an attempt to link the beer style to the hound.

Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:49"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.

Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Brewer may indicate on the bottle whether the yeast should be intentionally roused or if they prefer that the entry be poured as quietly as possible.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:43:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"LiqcRm","name":"Front Range Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Front Range","description":"Come visit Lafayette's first craft brewery.

Fruity esters, chill haze, and diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"23","ibuMax":"29","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:36:34"},"breweries":[{"id":"kIEM5y","name":"Herzoglich Bayerisches Brauhaus Tegernsee","nameShortDisplay":"Herzoglich Bayerisches Brauhaus Tegernsee","website":"http:\/\/www.braustuberl.de\/","established":"1675","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kIEM5y\/upload_1ulQoS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kIEM5y\/upload_1ulQoS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kIEM5y\/upload_1ulQoS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kIEM5y\/upload_1ulQoS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kIEM5y\/upload_1ulQoS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-02 23:37:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"yjkSJY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Schlossplatz 1","region":"Tegernsee","postalCode":"83684","phone":"(08022) 3455","website":"http:\/\/www.braustuberl.de\/","latitude":47.70797,"longitude":11.75674,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-03 01:04:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
