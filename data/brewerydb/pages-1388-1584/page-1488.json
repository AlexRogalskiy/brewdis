Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"AY6Jg8","name":"Depot Street Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Depot Street","website":"http:\/\/www.depotstreetbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AY6Jg8\/upload_pf2evA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AY6Jg8\/upload_pf2evA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AY6Jg8\/upload_pf2evA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AY6Jg8\/upload_pf2evA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AY6Jg8\/upload_pf2evA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:03:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1MPINS2B0W","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"aeuC0e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"904 Depot Street","locality":"Jonesborough","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37659","phone":"423-753-7628","website":"http:\/\/www.depotstreetbrewing.com\/","latitude":36.286031,"longitude":-82.48167,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NEpOry","name":"Southbound Stout","nameDisplay":"Southbound Stout","description":"The stout is a rich, robust and complex ale good for every season.

Meadmaker Sergio Moutela, remembers helping his grandfather make wine from a very early age, from helping with bottling, corking, and yes, even stomping grapes. Wine making was forever implanted into his life and who he has become today.\r\nAs an adult, he began making wine at home himself, as well as brewing his own beer and other fermented creations. This exploration of crafting his own fermented beverages brought him to his discovery of mead which took his creativity and passion by storm.\r\nToday, he has become a notable award-winning mead maker who's products have wowed even the most discerning and educated of palates. He also serves on the board of directors for the American Mead Makers Assosication and is the owner of the fastest growing meadery in the country.\r\nMelovino Meadery's gauge of success is not based on the number of awards we have won, although those are nice. Instead, our main focus at the meadery is making mead that our fans will love, and that we would love to drink too! That means using nothing but top quality ingredients, such as True Source Certified honey and reverse osmosis water. All masterfully crafted with a fully hands on approach in our mead making process.","website":"http:\/\/www.melovino.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5xivA\/upload_VghTTg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5xivA\/upload_VghTTg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5xivA\/upload_VghTTg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5xivA\/upload_VghTTg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5xivA\/upload_VghTTg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-28 04:03:37","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"yTW98U","name":"Melovino Meadery","streetAddress":"2933 Vauxhall Road","locality":"Vauxhall","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"07088","phone":"(855) 635-6846","website":"http:\/\/www.melovino.com\/","latitude":40.7206694,"longitude":-74.2882619,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"meadery","locationTypeDisplay":"Meadery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-09 20:15:18","updateDate":"2018-05-09 20:21:21","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-9:00am-6:00pm,thu-9:00am-6:00pm,fri-9:00am-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-8:00pm,mon-9:00am-6:00pm,tue-9:00am-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6YTsig","name":"Southern Basil","nameDisplay":"Southern Basil","description":"Formerly known as Summer Basil.\r\n\r\nCloudy, rustic country beer brewed with wheat and twelve pounds of basil from Hillsborough\u2019s Coon Rock Farm.

This exploration of crafting his own fermented beverages brought him to his discovery of mead which took his creativity and passion by storm.\r\nToday, he has become a notable award-winning mead maker who's products have wowed even the most discerning and educated of palates. He also serves on the board of directors for the American Mead Makers Assosication and is the owner of the fastest growing meadery in the country.\r\nMelovino Meadery's gauge of success is not based on the number of awards we have won, although those are nice. Instead, our main focus at the meadery is making mead that our fans will love, and that we would love to drink too!
