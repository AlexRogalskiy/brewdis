It\u2019s the story of a semi-lost 20 something year old with a young family, who fell in love with the art and science of brewing beer, instead of finishing college, like he was supposed to. He may well still be brewing in his garage at this very moment, if his retired father, Gary had not believed in his son, and offered to join him in business.\r\nGreg, with one small child and another on the way, somehow convinced his wife, Natalia that moving across two states and buying into a failing brewery was a good idea. If nothing else, Greg is persuasive. Three months into the social experiment, Gary, Greg\u2019s dad had the inspired idea to bring in Greg\u2019s good high school friend, Ross as a partner. Granted Ross was an English major (which has nothing to do with beer?), but hey, the guy can talk to anybody.\r\nAnd well, they did what anybody would do in their shoes. Worked all hours of the day for wages below poverty level. Talked to the people, found out what they wanted and made it. Poured beer at festivals all over the state. Shook hands. Begged for placements at bars. Picked up spare change off the sidewalk. Made big mistakes. Figured out how to correct them. Learned a few things the easy way. Learned a lot of things the hard way. And were grateful that at least they had access to nearly free beer.\r\nIn the process of struggling to make something out of very little, they figured out what Iron Horse Brewery really stood for. They weren\u2019t making beer to please the critics of the world, they were making craft beer for people. There are a lot of rules and regulations about how things should be, and when it comes to their beer and their lives, they don\u2019t care about rules. They care about innovation, taking risks, and authenticity.\r\nWith that core belief intact you have the Iron Horse Brewery of today; Greg continuing to push the envelope, Ross using a vernacular more appropriate to classical literature than selling beer, Gary suggesting barrier-busting, painfully optimistic future plans, Natalia still working in the business for the sole purpose of keeping Greg in check, and an amazing staff that keeps Iron Horse Beers moving into the hands of the people.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2019-06-19 17:51:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GYI9D85NL2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"xZTJW3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1000 Prospect Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 4","locality":"Ellensburg","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98926","phone":"509-933-3134","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","latitude":46.9994703,"longitude":-120.5648701,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2019-06-04 15:09:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"wWZMUP","name":"[the pub] by iron horse brewery","streetAddress":"412 North Main Street","locality":"Ellensburg","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98926","phone":"5098347838","hoursOfOperation":"we usually close no later than 9 during winter.","latitude":46.9959618,"longitude":-120.5482643,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-03 23:21:09","updateDate":"2019-06-04 15:07:51","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-9:00pm,tue-4:00pm-9:00pm,wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sun-11:00am-7:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"we usually close no later than 9 during winter.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YqIAdq","name":"Iron Horse Brewery","streetAddress":"1621 Vantage Highway","locality":"Ellensburg","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98926","latitude":47.0004205,"longitude":-120.5206871,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-03 23:21:47","updateDate":"2019-06-04 15:08:21","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wDFMwe","name":"Seneca Indian Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Seneca Indian Pale Ale","description":"A highly hopped, moderate bodied beer which comes in at 5.4% ABV.

We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.\r\n\r\nThat's our story so far.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery.
