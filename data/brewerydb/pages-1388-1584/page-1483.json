The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"mOFDzh","name":"Sun King Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sun King","description":"Sun King Brewing Company is an Indianapolis-based craft brewery with a focus on continually creating traditional seasonal and unique specialty beers. \r\n\r\nSun King rolled its first keg of beer out the door in July 2009 and since that time has grown into the second largest brewery in Indiana, producing over 27,000 barrels of beer in 2014 while selling all of it in Indiana.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"8brZJo","name":"Bury Me Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Bury Me","website":"http:\/\/www.burymebrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.burymebrewing.com\/subscribe\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8brZJo\/upload_6lyNnp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8brZJo\/upload_6lyNnp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8brZJo\/upload_6lyNnp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8brZJo\/upload_6lyNnp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8brZJo\/upload_6lyNnp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-04 21:10:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:57:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AHG2XOBJKI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LcABH4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4224 Cleveland Avenue","extendedAddress":"Unit 7","locality":"Fort Myers","region":"Florida","postalCode":"33901","phone":"(239) 332-2337","website":"www.burymebrewing.com","latitude":26.6008695,"longitude":-81.8724053,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-04 21:12:29","updateDate":"2019-10-01 11:43:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cBmgsQ","name":"Soulless Saison","nameDisplay":"Soulless Saison","description":"French-Belgian farmhouse ale infused with Juniper Berries and Ginger.","abv":"6.2","ibu":"19","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-21 16:57:56","updateDate":"2015-07-21 16:57:56","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"zQDRk8","name":"De Proef Brouwerij","nameShortDisplay":"De Proef Brouwerij","website":"http:\/\/www.proefbrouwerij.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"EIS0xw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Doornzelestraat 20","locality":"Lochristi-Hijfte","region":"Oost-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-09-\/-356.71.02","latitude":51.1161477,"longitude":3.8163988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"d4rwzR","name":"Sour Barrel #6","nameDisplay":"Sour Barrel #6","abv":"6.5","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-26 23:12:26","updateDate":"2016-12-26 23:14:14","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"zQDRk8","name":"De Proef Brouwerij","nameShortDisplay":"De Proef Brouwerij","website":"http:\/\/www.proefbrouwerij.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_JPdiHi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"EIS0xw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Doornzelestraat 20","locality":"Lochristi-Hijfte","region":"Oost-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-09-\/-356.71.02","latitude":51.1161477,"longitude":3.8163988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EPlLfx","name":"Sour Barrel Aged Farmhouse","nameDisplay":"Sour Barrel Aged Farmhouse","description":"Farmhouse aged in cabernet barrels.

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.
