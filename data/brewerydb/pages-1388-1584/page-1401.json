By 1995, they made plans to open a state-of-the-art facility, and in 1997, opened the Oasis Annex\u2014a 12,000 square foot facility also located in Boulder. Between the two locations, they had 22,000 square feet of brewing mania. However, the late 1990's and early 2000's saw microbrew beer sales take a turn for the worst, and Oasis decided that it was time to move on.

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling\/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QCBEW7618T","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-10:00am-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"J4CRxQ","name":"Scarcity IIIPA","nameDisplay":"Scarcity IIIPA","description":"A triple IPA brewed for San Francisco Beer Week, and as the name states, this beer will not be brewed regularly.

The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America\u2019s taps ran dry.\r\n\r\nThe brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco\u2019s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy\u2019s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery\u2019s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Tap Room opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery\u2019s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery\u2019s original fifteen barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.   \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Speakeasy beer brands and brewing equipment were acquired by Hunters Point Brewery, a company founded by former beverage distributor, Ces Butner. Under new ownership Speakeasy Ales & Lagers will grow by leaps and bounds.

The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America\u2019s taps ran dry.\r\n\r\nThe brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco\u2019s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy\u2019s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery\u2019s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Tap Room opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery\u2019s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery\u2019s original fifteen barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.   \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Speakeasy beer brands and brewing equipment were acquired by Hunters Point Brewery, a company founded by former beverage distributor, Ces Butner. Under new ownership Speakeasy Ales & Lagers will grow by leaps and bounds. The brewery\u2019s trademark eyes, ubiquitous and cryptic, beckon you to join our mob, no password required.","website":"http:\/\/www.goodbeer.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:46:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0BHXDML1I5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"t559gG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1195-A Evans Avenue","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94124","phone":"415-642-3371","website":"http:\/\/www.goodbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t9:00 am - 10:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:\t12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.7382569,"longitude":-122.3802492,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\t9:00 am - 10:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:\t12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cnG8c5","name":"Scarlet  Fire","nameDisplay":"Scarlet  Fire","description":"Scarlet Fire is an Irish\/American style Red Ale.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.
