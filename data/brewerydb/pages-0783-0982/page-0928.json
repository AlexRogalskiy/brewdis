For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

The other half of it is right here. The power of the internet, social media, and networking is here to see. Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d. So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/goT5b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-12-14 20:48:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"xoGGQz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"437 Dimmocks Mill Road","extendedAddress":"Suite 41","locality":"Hillsborough","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27278","phone":"919-697-8379","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Brewery open for public tours Saturday afternoon from 12.30pm until 4.30pm.
