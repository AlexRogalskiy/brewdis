If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"8O2BuI","name":"Lost Elm Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Lost Elm","description":"Formerly Bentley Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in Bentley Brewing and the Dark Horse Tavern.

If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"BznahA","name":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","nameShortDisplay":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","description":"Anheuser-Busch operates 12 breweries in the United States, 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:37:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JBEIXAV9NM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IVsXeI","name":"Jackalope Imperial Pumpkin Porter","nameDisplay":"Jackalope Imperial Pumpkin Porter","description":"Subtlety spiced yet massively squashed, Jackalope Imperial Pumpkin Porter is brewed with 250 pounds of squash\/pumpkin per batch.

Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

Chill haze and diacetyl should be absent.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"13","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:39:26"},"breweries":[{"id":"4iRmmM","name":"Sinistral Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sinistral","description":"7 BBL Brewery in Manassas, Virginia","website":"http:\/\/www.sinistralbrewingcompany.com","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4iRmmM\/upload_2jeN9d-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4iRmmM\/upload_2jeN9d-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4iRmmM\/upload_2jeN9d-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4iRmmM\/upload_2jeN9d-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4iRmmM\/upload_2jeN9d-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-23 14:51:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:46:42","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2LPM0KQITF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8kRrok","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"9419 Main Street","locality":"Manassas","region":"Virginia","latitude":38.7506752,"longitude":-77.4711571,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-24 13:55:40","updateDate":"2017-07-24 13:55:40","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
