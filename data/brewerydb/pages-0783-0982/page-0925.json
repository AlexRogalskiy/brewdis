This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Yv4kUK","name":"Lake Bluff Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Lake Bluff","description":"We're a quaint craft brewery in the Chicago's North Shore suburbs.

In addition to the attention to detail required for consistent and repeatable brews the brewmaster and support personnel follow a disciplined regiment of cleaning manually, and automatically with Clean-In-Place Systems (CIP) to exclude off-flavors, contaminants, and other undesirables in our beers.

We often brew hybrid styles, combining the features we like from established categories to create new, Island-Of-Doctor-Moreau-style mash-ups.\r\n\r\nFortunate Islands combines the mildly nutty malt body of a wheat beer with the intensely bright, citrusy hoppiness of a righteous IPA. Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches. We hope to release some our more successful experiments in cans and bottles in the coming years.","website":"http:\/\/moderntimesbeer.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-05 20:35:32","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:31:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"15J7L2HM86","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"P8CiOe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3725 Greenwood St.","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 546-9694","website":"http:\/\/DrinkModern.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  12:00pm -

We purchase our grain by the truckload and the bulk grain is blown into the silo from the grain truck. We use 75-80% of this grain in all of our beers. Then we measure our specialty malts into the mill. At this point we crush the malt so that the husk's are cracked open and the \"meat\" of the grain is exposed.","website":"http:\/\/www.sebagobrewing.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qxl1aG\/upload_9OlcI7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qxl1aG\/upload_9OlcI7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qxl1aG\/upload_9OlcI7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qxl1aG\/upload_9OlcI7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qxl1aG\/upload_9OlcI7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:09:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CNHI2M164F","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"38PkU3","name":"Matthew St.Hilaire","streetAddress":"616 Main St.","locality":"GORHAM","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04038","phone":"207-856-2537","website":"Sebagobrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm","latitude":43.6888024,"longitude":-70.3949697,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-08-28 16:54:54","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ahzsNL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"211 Fore St","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04101","phone":"207-775-2337","website":"Sebagobrewing.com","latitude":43.6591442,"longitude":-70.2508032,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-27 01:08:32","updateDate":"2018-08-28 16:55:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"P1SQA6","name":"Lake View","nameDisplay":"Lake View","description":"This is a golden to copper hued hop forward ale with a medium body and a toasty malt profile that provides a solid base for the hops.
