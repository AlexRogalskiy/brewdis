If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"iAJcs1","name":"Knee Deep Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Knee Deep","description":"Knee Deep Brewing Company is known for brewing big, hoppy West Coast style brews.

The recipes were developed from Ben Bredesen's time as a homebrewer, and scaled up to fit the newly installed 15 barrel brewhouse. As the city of Nashville grew, so did the brewery, and it quickly became apparent that expansion was necessary. The company purchased an acre and a half of land at 800 44th Avenue North, and went to work on the future of the brewery. Shortly after celebrating 4 years of business, the move from the East side to the West side began. From roughly 5000 square feet, to a brand new, state of the art, 33,000 square foot facility. When asked what the vision was for the project, Ben answered with one word, \u201cQuality\u201d.
