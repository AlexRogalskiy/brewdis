Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2x8Pcg","name":"Hopping Chicken Harvest Ale","nameDisplay":"Hopping Chicken Harvest Ale","abv":"6.5","styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-28 14:44:11","updateDate":"2015-10-28 14:44:11","style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling\/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QCBEW7618T","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-10:00am-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8MzTeQ","name":"Hopping Grizzly","nameDisplay":"Hopping Grizzly","abv":"8.5","ibu":"76","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-14 21:56:38","updateDate":"2017-07-18 20:40:37","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

We brew high quality beers with an uncompromising focus on detail, from the ingredient selection to the brewing process. A specially designed JV Northwest brewing system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since 2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. Mr. Karm has been a brewer of specialty beers since 1994, a life-long Akron, Ohio resident, and is a graduate of the University Of Akron.","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:14:50","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LI59Z10OUH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"UnpaXM","name":"The Tasting Room at Hoppin' Frog","streetAddress":"1680-F East Waterloo Rd.","locality":"Akron","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44306","phone":"234-525-3764","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","latitude":41.0245928,"longitude":-81.4677107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-08-18 14:10:32","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"38OSnR","name":"Hoppocratic Oath Imperial IPA","nameDisplay":"Hoppocratic Oath Imperial IPA","description":"Take The Oath!\r\n\r\nHoppocratic Oath is our salute to hops.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mj77Cx","name":"Hoppy @$ Fuck","nameDisplay":"Hoppy @$ Fuck","description":"Seriously hoppy ipa","abv":"7.4","ibu":"90","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Bahn Mi Flatbread","createDate":"2019-06-07 17:34:32","updateDate":"2019-06-07 17:36:37","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

This flavorful, highly aromatic beer is exactly how Tom and Ken originally intended it to be \u2013 a very drinkable and approachable Double IPA.\nThis double IPA has a pronounced citrus and tropical fruit aroma. Golden pale with a slight haze, it has a subtly sweet character from the malt profile and a crisp, hoppy finish.","abv":"7","ibu":"58","availableId":1,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2lfObU\/upload_wVaudM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2lfObU\/upload_wVaudM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2lfObU\/upload_wVaudM-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2lfObU\/upload_wVaudM-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2lfObU\/upload_wVaudM-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2lfObU\/upload_wVaudM-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-03-23 15:14:59","updateDate":"2018-04-26 20:38:14","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:06:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0TCEK1B5X9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6hmDVN","name":"Hoppy Amber","nameDisplay":"Hoppy Amber","description":"An American amber ale with a Northwest twist: generous amounts of Amarillo and Glacier hops give this beer its big fruity and citrusy flavor as well as its bitter, lasting finish.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"48","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-15 12:54:30","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:49","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
