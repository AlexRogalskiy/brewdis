Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

In addition to the above brands Pivovarna La\u0161ko also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target population.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions Pivovarna La\u0161ko brews unique beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna La\u0161ko entered an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand name iC Cider.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDespite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna La\u0161ko, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nThe Pivovarna La\u0161ko Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, and syrups for the productions of drinks, and also a newspaper and publishing activity.","website":"http:\/\/www.pivo-lasko.si\/","established":"1825","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-01 18:53:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8C6fp0","name":"Pivovarna La\u0161ko","streetAddress":"Trubarjeva ulica 28","locality":"La\u0161ko","postalCode":"`````","phone":"+386 3 734 80 00","website":"http:\/\/www.pivo-lasko.si\/","latitude":50.593349,"longitude":23.23594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"SI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-01 18:58:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"SI","name":"SLOVENIA","displayName":"Slovenia","isoThree":"SVN","numberCode":705,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nuSFww","name":"Lasser 1850 Jubil\u00e4umsbier","nameDisplay":"Lasser 1850 Jubil\u00e4umsbier","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 11:56:40","updateDate":"2018-11-02 20:08:37","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"opTwlP","name":"Five Boroughs Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"5 Boroughs","website":"http:\/\/www.fiveboroughs.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/opTwlP\/upload_YQW4CH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/opTwlP\/upload_YQW4CH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/opTwlP\/upload_YQW4CH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/opTwlP\/upload_YQW4CH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/opTwlP\/upload_YQW4CH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-21 16:00:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:43:45","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"41OHQ78MY9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"xgO0Do","name":"Brewery and Taproom","streetAddress":"215 47th Street","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11220","latitude":40.6505675,"longitude":-74.0144552,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-21 16:01:17","updateDate":"2018-01-01 20:06:34","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
