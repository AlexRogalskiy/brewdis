At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N39Q0L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2004 Capitol Avenue","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95814","phone":"916-448-7032","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","latitude":38.573116,"longitude":-121.480958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1987","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YRydPA","name":"India Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"India Pale Ale","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:28","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:39","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Their primary goal is to serve the immediate local market with fresh flavoursome beer.\r\n\r\nThe brewery has been a long time in the making, stemming from a long passion for beer and many years of home brewing. Fitzy started out brewing his first beer back in 1987 as a 16 year old. It was a Muntons \u2013 English Mild that seeded the journey many moons ago\u2026 in an era where good ingredients and quality information were very hard to obtain \u2013 oh how different it is today.\r\n\r\nHaving become lost in the wilderness for several years, the passion for great beer and brewing was rekindled when working with some like minded individuals circa 2001 at Unisys in Wellington. They would knock off at 4.30pm and have regular Friday afternoon beer tasting sessions, blind critiquing whatever was brought in, including their own special brews. Needless to say there was a great deal of heated discussion regarding the qualities or faults of each particular beer.\r\n\r\nThe passion for great tasting beer grew to such an extent that when the Fitzpatrick family moved to Tauranga in 2003, a \u201cbrewery space\u201d was added to the new shed plans, for that \u2018one day dream\u2019. Ten years later, with the help of wife Catherine, that dream is a reality.","website":"http:\/\/fitzpatricksbrewing.co.nz","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:45:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MhuHRk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"19 Keenan Road","locality":"Pyes PA","region":"Tauranga","postalCode":"3173","phone":"037-648-5650","latitude":-37.7742129,"longitude":176.1140377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:48:40","updateDate":"2018-07-18 17:50:15","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"y9slJE","name":"India Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"India Pale Ale","description":"A pop of tropical hop flavors up front and carrying throughout the\r\npalate with tangerine, apricot and stone fruit notes.
