By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013. Stop on by for a flight or a glass, hang out to enjoy our seasonal selections, and stay a while for a little South Dakota hospitality. \r\n\r\nJoin us in the Black Hills and discover your own pint of gold.","website":"http:\/\/www.minerbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:29:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P89USNBFD7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"2EpPvi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23845 Hwy 385","locality":"Hill City","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57745","phone":"(605) 574-2886","website":"http:\/\/www.minerbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"11 a.m. - 8 p.m. daily","latitude":43.948569,"longitude":-103.522307,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:42:49","updateDate":"2015-06-11 20:35:40","hoursOfOperationNotes":"11 a.m. - 8 p.m. daily","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"tHii3J","name":"Prairie Berry Eastbank","streetAddress":"322 East 8th Street","locality":"Sioux Falls","region":"SD","postalCode":"57103","phone":"605-496-7175","website":"http:\/\/www.prairieberry.com\/eastbank\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon.-Sat., 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sun., 11 a.m.-4 p.m.","latitude":43.5486429,"longitude":-96.7238975,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-11-17 21:32:03","updateDate":"2014-12-15 11:46:27","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon.-Sat., 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sun., 11 a.m.-4 p.m.","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uie5ik","name":"Imperial IPA","nameDisplay":"Imperial IPA","description":"A \u201cdouble\u201d IPA.

Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District. The Railyard area is a busy arts and entertainment district, where you can find a different show, market or exhibit every day of the week. Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility. Our goal in this taproom is to bring together the spirit of Second Street and our new neighborhood; An ever changing rotation of our unique beers, featured beer from other New Mexico breweries, unique food, friendly service, and curated live music featuring local and national artists.  \r\n\r\nIn 2018 we started packaging and distributing Second Street beer statewide.

The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011.

When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob\u2019s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of \u201cbeer mix\u201d and a bucket to brew.  We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, \u201cOh great, there\u2019s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month\u2019s time.\u201d  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we\u2019re married, I couldn\u2019t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewage.at","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:45:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mMnrjZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mittelgasse 4","locality":"1060 Wien","phone":"+43 1 9550935","website":"http:\/\/brewage.at\/","latitude":48.1939642,"longitude":16.3434939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","updateDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-7:00pm,wed-2:00pm-7:00pm,thu-2:00pm-7:00pm,fri-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"Europe\/Vienna","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UuCdQZ","name":"Imperial IPA-Hoppy","nameDisplay":"Imperial IPA-Hoppy","description":"The American Imperial IPA style was developed and made popular by west coast American brewers.
