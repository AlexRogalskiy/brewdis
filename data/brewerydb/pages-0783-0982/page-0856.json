Well it started as a business venture Tim basically decided the town and hopefully his pocket needed a micro brewery, (shallow I know, it gets better). Simon wanted in. As Tim had never brewed beer and Simon was a very casual brewer it was deemed necessary that Tim has a basic understanding of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Tim's world was getting complicated... As everything fell apart around them what started as a requirement to start a brewery became a passion that filled days and nights in the shed. Micro brewery plans were put to one side and life went on. We never stopped brewing! Our equipment grew, our knowledge blossomed, books were read courses attended and through the toughest times in our lives brewing was a constant. We created new beers, new flavours, we made beers that will never be repeated and some that never should have existed in the first place.\r\n\r\nYears after our plans for world domination had ended and our brewery had been all but forgotten we realised that we had the tools, knowledge and passion to make this thing happen. Without knowing it was happening we had become beer activists, beer judges and most importantly quality craft beer brewers!\r\n\r\nWe will brew great beer, and we have seen this dream to the end.

We are not trying to coin a beer style \u2013 we\u2019re just having fun.  The Jack D\u2019Or (pronounced \u201cJack Door\u201d), is at the very center of Pretty Things and nearly three years on we\u2019re still pleased as punch that he joined us!\r\n\r\nAs you know, PRETTY THINGS doesn\u2019t brew \u201cstyles\u201d per se.  Close, but we re-imagine everything and leave the style numbers in books on the shelves where they belong.  What that means is that while other people might be able to put our beers into a category, we have a hard time with it! Our beers are first and foremost creative beasts, not \u201ctypes\u201d of beer. Jack D\u2019Or is the kind of beer Martha and Dann like to drink before, after and during a great meal. Heck, we\u2019ll drink this sort of beer any time.\r\n\r\nOn Dann & Martha\u2019s honeymoon in France and Belgium they stashed quite a few cases of Wallonian beer into their trunk. Every night after setting up their tent they\u2019d cook lardons and lentils on a camp stove and enjoy fresh \u201csaison\u201d under the stars.\r\n\r\nInspired by some of our favorites like Saison DuPont, but also DeRanke\u2019s XX Bitter, De Dolle\u2019s Arabier, and local IPAs like Smuttynose, the Jack D\u2019Or starts off with North American Pils, Vienna, Wheat and Malted Oats (among others) and is hopped with a combination of four hops, finishing with Palisade and Nugget. The bitterness is the real backbone of the Jack D\u2019Or.  It\u2019s a proper \u201cplant-like\u201d bitterness with all of its jagged edges, beginning deep in the soil, then to the stem of this beer and up into to the very tippity heights.  Fermentation-wise we use a blend of four yeast strains to give Jack D\u2019Or its refreshingly dry character.  Finally, despite all of the spicy flavours in this beer it contains no actual spices \u2013 only malt, oats, rye, sugar, hops and yeast.  One more time: there are no spices or citrus in Jack D\u2019Or. Wheat lends acidity at Jack\u2019s edges, then rye and our blended yeast character come into play for a bit of polyphony, displeasing the notion of \u201cbalance\u201d and creating the fire in the belly of Jack D\u2019Or!\r\n\r\nThe creature on the label is Jack D\u2019Or himself, conceived and drawn by Dann. Far away in a small clearing in the woods of New England, ankle deep in the mash tun, he contemplates and conjures himself into a batch of beer. For those of you who are new to this, Jack is a grain of malted barley, but more than that: he is the unifying force behind all of the Pretty Things.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation.

We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"waJE51","name":"Jack Tha DRIPA","nameDisplay":"Jack Tha DRIPA","description":"Double Rice IPA","abv":"8.5","ibu":"65","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-26 14:53:33","updateDate":"2017-08-26 14:53:34","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
