It was a modest beginning with some obstacles, but enthusiasm prevailed and thanks to the support of our loyal customers, it was a success! Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District. The Railyard area is a busy arts and entertainment district, where you can find a different show, market or exhibit every day of the week. Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility. Our goal in this taproom is to bring together the spirit of Second Street and our new neighborhood; An ever changing rotation of our unique beers, featured beer from other New Mexico breweries, unique food, friendly service, and curated live music featuring local and national artists.  \r\n\r\nIn 2018 we started packaging and distributing Second Street beer statewide. You can now enjoy Santa Fe\u2019s favorite beer on draft in restaurants and bars, and purchase it in cans to bring home and to your next gathering. We look forward to expanding our can options to include seasonal and special edition brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2019-06-12 17:42:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HYMUDNW6KP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HlrMmv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1814 Second Street","locality":"Santa Fe","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87505","phone":"1-505-982-3030","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","latitude":35.6633395,"longitude":-105.9659469,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9eVz7n","name":"Railyard","streetAddress":"1607 Paseo De Peralta","extendedAddress":"#10","locality":"Santa Fe","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87501","phone":"(505) 989-3278","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","latitude":35.6821338,"longitude":-105.9490908,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-10-30 11:44:38","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"E8c2Mh","name":"K\u00f6lsch","nameDisplay":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is a variant of the traditional German ales that originated in and around Cologne.

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:13:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"UYOVWAHCBD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RW6Da0","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Laurel","region":"MD","postalCode":"20723","latitude":39.1426709,"longitude":-76.860565,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-03-14 17:43:05","updateDate":"2016-05-01 14:34:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rOntaj","name":"K\u00f6lsch","nameDisplay":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"A refreshing German style golden ale, perfect for summer drinking.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"C2PUJ9","name":"Kolsch Bier","nameDisplay":"Kolsch Bier","description":"A crisp, slightly dry, subtly sweet beer, golden in color.

Originating in Cologne (K\u00f6ln in German, both the dialect spoken and a person hailing from that city are called 'K\u00f6lsch'), K\u00f6lsch is a modern descendant of the Medieval Rhenish Ale brewed throughout the region north of Munich, a distinction it shares with the nearby Dusseld\u00f6rf Alt (you will hear more about this style in the near future). As demand for light colored beers grew, Cologne's brewers first developed a beer brewed mostly with wheat, quite similar to the German Weisse, called 'Keutebier'. Probably similar to a Belgian Wit, but lacking that beer's spices, Keutebier dominated brewing production in Cologne for almost 300 years. It wasn't until the 19th century that wheat started to disappear from the recipe, gradually replaced by Pilsner, until Keutebier had morphed into the modern K\u00f6lsch. 1906 is generally credited as the year modern K\u00f6lsch was first brewed by the S\u00fcnner Brewery. This new beer's popularity grew quickly, inspiring many brewers throughout the area to brew something similar. In 1946, the first agreement was signed by participating brewers that defined K\u00f6lsch. Throughout a turbulent history, many more agreements and legal battles have been waged until K\u00f6lsch was finally recognized by the EU with regional protections similar to those enjoyed by wine. Today a true K\u00f6lsch is brewed only in Cologne or the immediate area, but beers inspired by K\u00f6lsch are brewed all over the world. Clandestine's 'K\u00f6lsch I Can' is brewed with the same spirit as its German cousins: it is a subtle, malty, clean, crisp ale that has been lagered to reach peak flavors. Respectful of tradition, this beer is brewed only with German malts and hops. Soft water is used to push the malt flavors to the forefront of this still delicate beer. Just in time for hot weather, this is a perfect lawnmower beer!","abv":"5.3","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.04","createDate":"2014-06-06 16:53:08","updateDate":"2014-06-06 16:53:08","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

The duo started out as friends and quickly realized their shared passion for craft beer and general imbibing. After several years of homebrewing on Austin Street in Westbrook, they decided to take the plunge. Self-financed and eager to begin, they purchased and assembled a one-barrel brewing system and got to work. Austin Street opened its doors on Industrial Way in Portland, Maine in early 2014. Since then, Will and Jake have maintained 100% ownership of their startup. Although this arrangement has its limitations, Jake and Will insist this is the only way for them to stay true to their creative roots while providing the best products possible to consumers and guests of their tasting rooms. Now utilizing 160 barrels of fermentation space between two production facilities, the pair is poised to maintain their position of integrity and quality in the very community that supports them.","website":"http:\/\/www.austinstreetbrewery.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-09 14:03:14","updateDate":"2019-04-06 20:15:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q4JBD586WH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LrQuwi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Industrial Way","extendedAddress":"Suite 8","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04103","phone":"(207) 200-1994","website":"http:\/\/www.austinstreetbrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday 12pm-5pm\r\nMonday 12pm-7pm\r\nTuesday - CLOSED\r\nWednesday - Saturday - 12pm - 7pm","latitude":43.7028644,"longitude":-70.3200298,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-13 19:20:47","updateDate":"2019-04-06 20:23:10","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday 12pm-5pm\r\nMonday 12pm-7pm\r\nTuesday - CLOSED\r\nWednesday - Saturday - 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ua6Mb2","name":"Austin Street Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Fox Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04101","phone":"(207) 200-1994","website":"http:\/\/www.austinstreetbrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Wednesday - 12pm - 7pm\r\nThursday - Saturday - 12pm- 9pm","latitude":43.6652233,"longitude":-70.2576771,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-03-26 18:28:47","updateDate":"2019-04-06 20:21:28","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Wednesday - 12pm - 7pm\r\nThursday - Saturday - 12pm- 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kNA2j3","name":"Kona Brown","nameDisplay":"Kona Brown","description":"Brown Coffee Ale","abv":"6.2","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-09 19:27:03","updateDate":"2016-12-09 19:27:03","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
