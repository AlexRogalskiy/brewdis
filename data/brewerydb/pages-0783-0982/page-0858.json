The Micro Brewing Company and Restaurant is known as a neighborhood icon in Fresno. Scott and Michele changed the name to wholesale their beer throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nKevin continued on as Sequoia's Brewmaster, putting together a creative mix of 11 unique ales and lagers on tap brewed with the finest ingredients including monthly special beers, wines, specialty drinks, and their homemade Root Beer. Recently, Rick Bouke took over as Brewmaster, and is responsible for the high quality and craft beer character our customers have come to expect. Sequoia's menu offers great food with the freshest ingredients, serves Certified Angus Beef, prepares their sauces and items from scratch and offers fresh daily fish.\r\n\r\nSequoia offers a menu for all ages in a warm and comfortable atmosphere, where everyone knows your name. Sequoia is a hot spot for live music featuring the best local bands and a private party room. A second location with a mountain lodge atmosphere, rock fireplace and a patio was opened in Northeast Fresno in July of 2005 at Piazza del Fiore.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"BE5WM0","name":"Jopen","nameShortDisplay":"Jopen","description":"Jopen beers are the traditional beers from Haarlem Holland (NL).

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":22,"name":"Cascade","description":"Cascade was created in the United States as an open-pollinated cross between Fuggle and Serebrianker.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nUT6v5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2072 Stoneman Circle","locality":"Lakewood","region":"New York","postalCode":"14750","phone":"716-763-5479","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1008305,"longitude":-79.3356897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-27 14:23:02","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OJrSkt","name":"Southern Tier Brewing Company-Pittsburgh","streetAddress":"316 N Shore Dr.","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15212","phone":"(412) 301-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.stbcbeer.com\/capabilities-view\/about-stbc-pittsburgh\/","latitude":40.4463787,"longitude":-80.0104128,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-09 00:10:10","updateDate":"2018-04-10 14:11:48","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mNF573","name":"Jahr of Porter","nameDisplay":"Jahr of Porter","availableId":4,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-28 22:14:04","updateDate":"2015-01-28 22:14:04","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer.
