PBPI was established in 1994 as the American affiliate of Peter Austin & Partners (Contracts) Ltd., an English brewery consultancy run by Pugsley and Peter Austin since 1982.\r\n\r\nPugsley joined Peter Austin & Partners and the Ringwood Brewery in 1982, fresh from Manchester University with a degree in biochemistry. He learned the brewing business from the ground up, overseeing the formulation of a wide range of ales and traditional English beers. During his time at Ringwood he supervised the installation of 20 breweries around the world, and also collaborated with Austin in the development of the direct-fired, brick clad, copper whirlpool and hop percolator-essential components of the original Peter Austin brick kettle brewing system. Austin's design philosophy, which has withstood the test of time, is to make the system rugged, reliable, easy to operate, clean and maintain. To date, more than 130 Austin systems have been installed worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe Johnny Appleseed of Craft Brewing\r\n\r\nPugsley arrived in the U.S. in 1986 to set up the D.L. Geary Brewing Company in Portland, Maine, and has since helped set up more than 80 breweries in North America. He has been dubbed the \"Johnny Appleseed of Craft Brewing\" by a well knowntrade journal.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Pugsley became a partner in Portland's Shipyard Brewing Company, overseeing its growth from a small, seven-barrel brewpub in Kennebunk to a full fledged brewery. Shipyard produced 10,000 barrels in its first year, and was producing 160,000 barrels by 2014, making it the 16th largest craft brewer in the U.S. The brewery's growth was accomplished using a 100-barrel brew length Peter Austin system, brewing five times a day, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nBy 2012, Pugsley had helped Shipyard expand to maximum capacity, enabling him to step back from day to day operations. He is currently focused on helping clients, existing and new, produce balanced, consistent English-style beers.\r\n\r\nPugsley Brewing Projects International provides a wide range of services to aspiring brewery owners and established breweries looking to improve and refine their product. From three-barrel brewpub systems to 150,000-plus barrel systems, PBPI can help you achieve quality and consistency in classic English and cask-conditioned ales, as well as ales with your own uniquely American twist.","website":"https:\/\/www.pugsleybrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6NVw8o\/upload_mVF8gc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6NVw8o\/upload_mVF8gc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6NVw8o\/upload_mVF8gc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6NVw8o\/upload_mVF8gc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6NVw8o\/upload_mVF8gc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2019-06-11 18:04:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"seMgg2","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04104","phone":"207-871-1121","website":"https:\/\/www.pugsleybrewing.com\/","latitude":43.6599999,"longitude":-70.27,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2019-06-11 18:03:20","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uuqQiJ","name":"Kennett Ale","nameDisplay":"Kennett Ale","description":"A collaboration brew with Victory Brewing Co!

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"IuEeGC","name":"Alltech Lexington Brewing and Distilling Company","nameShortDisplay":"Alltech Lexington","description":"Welcome to our little microbrewery in the heart of downtown Lexington.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"beerVariation":{"id":"QWXU8i","name":"Dark Star Imperial Oatmeal Stout","nameDisplay":"Dark Star Imperial Oatmeal Stout","abv":"8","styleId":21,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-25 13:31:47","updateDate":"2016-02-11 16:09:13","style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet flavors and aromas can be intense, not cloying, while complementing fruitiness. Though well attenuated it usually has a full, creamy body. Hop characters do not dominate; low to low-medium bitterness is perceived. Perception of alcohol can be extreme. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma should not be evident. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived. Well balanced with savoring\/sipping drinkability. Oxidative character if evident in aged Quads should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"9","abvMax":"14","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.084","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:33:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"gJZUdw","name":"Karbach Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Karbach","description":"We like beer.

Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.058","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"cFtnoN","name":"One Trick Pony Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"One Trick Pony","description":"We are a small microbrewery located south of Chicago, in Lansing Illinois.
