There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"OYtwtU","name":"Cape May Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Cape May","description":"Cape May Brewing Company began with one simple question: Where\u2019s all the beer down here?? With that in mind, we decided to provide South Jersey with fresh, delicious, local beer to put New Jersey on the map as a craft beer state.\r\n\r\nIn July 2011, we found our home at the Cape May Airport, excitedly purchased our forklift, and delivered our first keg of Cape May IPA to Cabanas Beach Bar and Grill. Since then, we\u2019ve proudly brewed all our beers here, crafting balanced and flavorful ales and lagers for thousands of happy locals and visitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year, hundreds of our beers can be found throughout the South Jersey and Philadelphia areas. We are proud to self-distribute our beers to hundreds of bars, restaurants, and liquor stores, ensuring premium freshness and excellent service. While the majority of our beers are only available on draft, we bottle several of our flagship brews as well as our recent, highly-acclaimed Barrel Aged Series.\r\n\r\nOur Tasting Room is the largest and most accessible in the state, with a spacious and sunny Beer Garden.

This flavour-packed beer is a fine match for most spicy Asian and Mexican influenced dishes, or fruity hard cheeses.","abv":"4.8","styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZcrO3M\/upload_Pr96J7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZcrO3M\/upload_Pr96J7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZcrO3M\/upload_Pr96J7-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZcrO3M\/upload_Pr96J7-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZcrO3M\/upload_Pr96J7-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZcrO3M\/upload_Pr96J7-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-11 18:09:04","updateDate":"2018-07-11 18:10:16","style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

Some time much further down the track they talked about starting a business together. This discussion almost certainly occurred over a beer. Doing what? The answer was right in front of them.\r\n\r\nAndy (Andrew Larsen) had already spent fourteen years in the beer industry. As a brewer and brewing consultant, his business Breowan Systems is a leading player in everything to do with brewing, and Andy works with fellow brewers all around the globe. But what Andy wanted more than anything else, more than a drive in a rally car, more than a Stratocaster, was a brewery in his hometown. Somewhere he could cruise down to on a Sunday with his daughter Katherine, lay a brew down, and listen to some Bailterspace, turned up loud.\r\n\r\nAnt (Anthony Browne) was a suit and tie wearer until 2010. As a beer drinker and lover of all good things in life, he was inevitably drawn to craft beer. After a year and a half of bumming around, some travel and a bit of study, in May 2012 Andy convinced Ant to join him for a week in Melbourne. Good Beer Week to be precise. Not much convincing was necessary. Andy showed Ant what his work in the Aussie beer industry made clear.\r\n\r\nThat restaurant menus need not be a let-down when you get to the beer list. That pubs can serve beers from little breweries, not just the big guys. And that there is a growing number of people that want more than golden lagers and brown ales. Trips to Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington followed, after which Ant was forced to admit that his beloved home-town of Auckland was missing out.\r\n\r\nSo what to do then? A brewery, certainly. But we also wanted to stock beers from all over the world, to keep discovering. And we wanted to offer the flexibility to have a beer at our place, or take some home. Preferably both :-)\r\n\r\nAfter three months planning, constructing and creating, on the 5th of December we opened the Retail Store and Beer Tasting Lounge.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 we outgrew our little brewery and opened up Juke Joint, our new mothership in Mt Eden. Home to our BBQ smokehouse and new, expanded brewery. We started bottling our beer and got it out to the best restaurants, cafes, bars and bottle shops all over Auckland.\r\n\r\nSince then we've broadened our horizons to our Barrel Room out in Orakei where we're serving up gourmet burgers and our signature range of world class beers to the good people of the Eastern Bays. Who knows what's next?","website":"http:\/\/brothersbeer.co.nz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 18:46:22","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5w49AD","name":"Brothers City Works Depot","streetAddress":"90 Wellesley Street","region":"Auckland","postalCode":"1010","phone":"64-9-366-6100","website":"https:\/\/brothersbeer.co.nz\/pages\/brothers-cwd","latitude":-36.8497064,"longitude":174.7583632,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 18:52:03","updateDate":"2018-07-17 18:57:15","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-12:00pm-10:00pm,thu-12:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-10:00pm,mon-12:00pm-10:00pm,tue-12:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"KZVlT5","name":"Brothers Brewery & Juke Joint","streetAddress":"5 Akiraho Street","locality":"Mount Eden","region":"Auckland","postalCode":"1024","phone":"64-09-638-7592","website":"brothersbeer.co.nz\/pages\/brothers-brewery-juke-joint","latitude":-36.8684693,"longitude":174.7588,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 18:56:22","updateDate":"2018-07-17 18:57:54","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:30am-10:00pm,wed-11:30am-10:00pm,thu-11:30am-10:00pm,fri-11:30am-10:00pm,sat-11:30am-10:00pm,sun-11:30am-8:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"wtEZcW","name":"Brothers Orakei","streetAddress":"228 Orakei Road","locality":"Remuera","region":"Auckland","postalCode":"1050","phone":"64-09-974-3380","website":"https:\/\/brothersbeer.co.nz\/pages\/brothers-orakei","latitude":-36.86328,"longitude":174.8101879,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17 19:03:13","updateDate":"2018-07-17 19:04:07","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-12:00pm-11:00pm,mon-12:00pm-11:00pm,tue-12:00pm-11:00pm,wed-12:00pm-11:00pm,thu-12:00pm-11:00pm,fri-11:30am-11:00pm,sat-11:30am-11:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cIGACh","name":"Lager","nameDisplay":"Lager","description":"The golden yellow, bright, mild bearings convinces with its freshness and the light, malty aroma matics.

These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"nFCNFR","name":"Chinggis Beer Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Chinggis Beer","description":"Our atmost goal is become well respected brand in the Asiapacific region.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, \u201cChinggis beer \u201cLLC was the landmark in the history of Mongolian Beer market supplying high quality beer brewed according to the quality control stature or famous \u201c Reinheitsgebot\u201d , Beer Purity law of Germany.","website":"http:\/\/www.chinggisbeer.mn\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nFCNFR\/upload_FfmXTo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nFCNFR\/upload_FfmXTo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nFCNFR\/upload_FfmXTo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nFCNFR\/upload_FfmXTo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nFCNFR\/upload_FfmXTo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 22:00:17","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0s8yID","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Sukhbaatar street-10,","extendedAddress":"6th Khoroo,","locality":"Chingeltei District","region":"Ulaanbaatar","phone":"+ (976)-70115820","website":"http:\/\/www.chinggisbeer.mn\/","latitude":47.921378,"longitude":106.90554,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"MN","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 13:15:41","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"MN","name":"MONGOLIA","displayName":"Mongolia","isoThree":"MNG","numberCode":496,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OhqK1S","name":"Lager","nameDisplay":"Lager","description":"Light\r\nCrisp\r\nClear\r\nRefreshing","abv":"4.5","ibu":"12","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-03 15:36:46","updateDate":"2019-07-03 19:59:29","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"YpLsp2","name":"Schlossbrauerei zu Schmieheim","nameShortDisplay":"Schlossbrauerei zu Schmieheim","website":"http:\/\/www.hieronymus-bier.info\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"zVSWei","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe 64","locality":"Kippenheim","postalCode":"77971","latitude":48.29441,"longitude":7.824663,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 15:03:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3k4sNX","name":"Lager","nameDisplay":"Lager","availableId":3,"styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3k4sNX\/upload_xKrgD1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3k4sNX\/upload_xKrgD1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3k4sNX\/upload_xKrgD1-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3k4sNX\/upload_xKrgD1-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3k4sNX\/upload_xKrgD1-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3k4sNX\/upload_xKrgD1-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 01:37:39","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.
