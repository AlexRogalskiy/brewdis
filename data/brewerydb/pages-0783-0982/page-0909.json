Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"iPKpK0","name":"Brouwerij Wilderen","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij Wilderen","website":"http:\/\/www.brouwerijwilderen.be\/index.php\/en\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iPKpK0\/upload_ePmOxc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iPKpK0\/upload_ePmOxc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iPKpK0\/upload_ePmOxc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iPKpK0\/upload_ePmOxc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iPKpK0\/upload_ePmOxc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-30 21:56:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5mI1co","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3803 Wilderen","locality":"Wilderenlaan 8","phone":"+32 11 58 06 80","website":"http:\/\/www.brouwerijwilderen.be\/index.php\/en\/","latitude":50.8189817,"longitude":5.1436364,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-30 21:59:01","updateDate":"2016-04-30 21:59:01","timezoneId":"Europe\/Brussels","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YBBOiw","name":"Kriek","nameDisplay":"Kriek","description":"Blended, barrel aged, fruit ale","abv":"6.3","styleId":66,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-13 15:47:16","updateDate":"2017-09-13 15:47:16","style":{"id":66,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Lambic","shortName":"Lambic","description":"Unblended, naturally and spontaneously fermented lambic is intensely estery, sour, and sometimes, but not necessarily, acetic flavored.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"em9Lxc","name":"Two Roads Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Two Roads","description":"Two Roads isn\u2019t just the logo on our brewery building, it\u2019s our philosophy.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"rdrfPw","name":"Boom Island Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Boom Island","description":"Boom Island Brewing Company opened fall 2011 on the shores of the Mississippi, a hops throw away from of our namesake island.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0PxrLF","name":"Kriek","nameDisplay":"Kriek (2013)","styleId":68,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2013,"labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0PxrLF\/upload_Yjrnn8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0PxrLF\/upload_Yjrnn8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0PxrLF\/upload_Yjrnn8-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0PxrLF\/upload_Yjrnn8-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0PxrLF\/upload_Yjrnn8-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0PxrLF\/upload_Yjrnn8-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-09 11:00:58","updateDate":"2015-12-17 12:01:23","style":{"id":68,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","shortName":"Fruit Lambic","description":"These beers, also known by the names framboise, kriek, peche, cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit flavors and aromas.

It is one of the last remaining authentic lambic breweries of Belgium and well known for its lambic beer brewed along traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nLambic matures up to three years in wooden barrels, whereupon it is blended to make Oude Geuze. Sour cherries undergo fermentation in lambic beer and after a second fermentation in the bottle Oude Kriek is born. This unique brewing process with spontaneous fermentation is possible in Belgium in the Pajottenland region, the Zenne Valley and in Brussels, because of the presence of a specific microflora.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of succession in the family business at the end of 2002, the traditional lambic beers of Oud Beersel were threatened to disappear. Shocked by the loss of this cultural and historical patrimony, the brewery was taken over in 2005 and business was restarted pursuing the principal aim to protect the time-honoured lambic beers, as well as the cultural and historical heritage of Oud Beersel for the coming generations.\r\n\r\nThis traditional brewery of lambic beers is nowadays managed in a modern way with respect for tradition and the m\u00e9tier. The traditional part of the production process of the lambic beers, in particular the spontaneous fermentation, the maturation of lambic in wooden barrels and the mixture of various lambic casks and vintages constitutes the core business of the company. The production process is completed in close collaboration with excellent partners who manage the industrial equipment. By the synergy between the m\u00e9tier and the industry, Oud Beersel offers authentic products of the highest quality.\r\n\r\nThanks to the success of the special Bersalis beers, i.e. the high fermentation beers of Oud Beersel, investments are continuously made to optimize the production process, to achieve the most demanding quality standards and to extend the infrastructure for the time-honoured lambic beers of Oud Beersel in order to meet the always growing demand.","website":"http:\/\/www.oudbeersel.com\/","established":"1882","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"6xIUOg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Laarheiestraat 230","locality":"Beersel","region":"Vlaams Brabant","latitude":50.7599724,"longitude":4.3047963,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sBfDb8","name":"Kriek","nameDisplay":"Kriek","abv":"6.9","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-28 15:27:32","updateDate":"2016-05-28 15:27:32","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"},"breweries":[{"id":"iieorl","name":"Cider Creek Hard Cider","nameShortDisplay":"Cider Creek","description":"Cider Creek Hard Cider is made on a family farm nestled in the hills of Canisteo, NY.

He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive.

In that same year, the first barrels of \"Ouden Tripel\", what is today called \"VanderGhinste Oud Bruin\", rolled across the cobblestones in Bellegem and were renowned as far as French Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the brewery has been continuously in family hands from its early start to the present has become a rarity.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the new \"Pilsener Type\" from  Czechoslovakia, the brewery develops its own type of pils under the name \"Ghinst Pils\". That\u2019s why, in 1929 the construction of a low fermentation tower was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe year after its construction the tower was already operating and now still dominates the rolling countryside of Bellegem. From the highway that connects Kortrijk to Tournai, one can clearly see the tower rising next to the church of Bellegem.","website":"http:\/\/www.omervanderghinste.be\/","established":"1892","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/toA2ip\/upload_bveAoo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/toA2ip\/upload_bveAoo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/toA2ip\/upload_bveAoo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/toA2ip\/upload_bveAoo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/toA2ip\/upload_bveAoo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-19 16:25:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"2Lk6dT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Kwabrugstraat 5","region":"Bellegem","postalCode":"8500","phone":"32 56 23 51 71","latitude":50.7770791,"longitude":3.2788671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-19 16:26:21","updateDate":"2015-10-19 16:26:21","timezoneId":"Europe\/Brussels","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6Ow0iK","name":"Kriek Lambic","nameDisplay":"Kriek Lambic","description":"\u201cKriek\u201d means cherry, and we\u2019ve made this Belgian-style ale our own by using Door County cherry juice and some Wisconsin organic malts.

Waste products are given to local farmers, where they can be used; materials used are recycled or reused whenever possible; and second-hand equipment is largely used. Have a look at our earth-friendly brewing practices.\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales: Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Due to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"NzbBOK","name":"Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan","nameShortDisplay":"Weihenstephaner","description":"The Bavarian State Brewery Weihenstephan, founded in 1040, is the oldest existing brewery in the world.

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.
