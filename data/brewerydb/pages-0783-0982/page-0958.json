These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"SWMzJ3","name":"Ass Clown Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Ass Clown","description":"We are imaginative brewers specializing in small batches, Making handcrafted an understatement.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"t9cCJ5","name":"The Commons Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"The Commons","description":"The Commons Brewery is a small craft brewery located in Southeast Portland, Oregon.","website":"http:\/\/www.commonsbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2019-02-27 21:38:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"jqK43H","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"630 SE Belmont St.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","phone":"503-819-0758","website":"http:\/\/www.commonsbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Th & Fri: 5-9-ish \r\nSaturday 2-9-ish \r\nSunday 2-6","latitude":45.51631,"longitude":-122.6590488,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2019-02-27 21:38:28","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Th & Fri: 5-9-ish \r\nSaturday 2-9-ish \r\nSunday 2-6","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6XxWak","name":"Little Brown","nameDisplay":"Little Brown","description":"This smokey brown ale was brewed to raise awareness for the endangered little brown bat.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.\r\n\r\n In June of 2013, Matt purchased Charlie's shares of Double Mountain, vowing to continue the good work the two partners created.","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001nxNUBQroFr3hjq6FYVwFkkyCOBhaGExXaxrZhqC8w77l41A-A2WhADmLcObiDpQkWRv_aW3ZWsS2PPug8oPv5xCH8VvV78Ga","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:17:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9XZOTHG3QJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"4kMvnC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8 Fourth Street","locality":"Hood River","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97031","phone":"541-387-0042","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.7099797,"longitude":-121.5144842,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OAnNVF","name":"Double Mountain Taproom","streetAddress":"4336 Woodstock Blvd","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97206","phone":"(503) 206-5495","website":"www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.4789106,"longitude":-122.6177216,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:05","updateDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TBXjG6","name":"Little Galaxy","nameDisplay":"Little Galaxy","description":"There was a time where the term \"Lager\" meant you would never be able to sell a pint over your counter. Then the term \"Session\" became a scarlet letter to a beer making sure no one would drop cash on the bar top for a pint of low ABV hop magic. In our constant attempt to brew beers that nobody will buy, we decided to combine the aforementioned styles and terms to create a Session India Pale Lager: Little Galaxy. Our third child in the Galaxy single-hop series of beers, Little Galaxy is part American Light Lager and part Session IPA. A clean and simple grain bill of Barley and Rice is mashed at a high temperature to retain a heavier body than your typical Light Lager to support an IPA amount of high alpha Galaxy hops from Australia. Fermented with our house Lager strain, we develop an extremely clean ester profile that flees from the giant hop aroma of fresh picked apricots and pineapple. Left un-fined and hazy, this Session IPL brings all of the refreshment and bright nature of a traditional domestic Lager with all of the hop juice you want in an IPA. The perfect beer for a heat wave, Little Galaxy Session IPL can be crushed with reckless abandon regardless of the season.","abv":"4","styleId":108,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-04 13:39:45","updateDate":"2017-10-04 13:39:45","style":{"id":108,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Session Beer","shortName":"Session","description":"Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
