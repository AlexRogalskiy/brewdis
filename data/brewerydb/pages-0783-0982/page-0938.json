It sits between the rivers Wye and Severn, surrounded by orchards growing cider apples. My first visit to Ledbury was as a brewer, to buy English hops in the autumn of 2007. I returned in 2011, a newly minted Cider-maker, to meet Tom Oliver. Tom makes traditional cider and perry in Ocle Pynchard, Herefordshire, to my palate among the very best. \r\n\r\nThe Ledbury Cider is an English-style medium cider \u2013 not too dry, not too sweet. A blend of old world bittersweet apples and new world heirloom varieties are fermented with native yeast, adding a bit of farminess to the ripe apple nose.","abv":"6.5","styleId":150,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ROuhxy\/upload_rziBgc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ROuhxy\/upload_rziBgc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ROuhxy\/upload_rziBgc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ROuhxy\/upload_rziBgc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ROuhxy\/upload_rziBgc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ROuhxy\/upload_rziBgc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-27 20:15:50","updateDate":"2015-12-17 16:19:00","style":{"id":150,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"English Cider","shortName":"English Cider","description":"Generally dry, full-bodied, austere.","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","ogMin":"1.05","ogMax":"1.075","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:48:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"2yrsTh","name":"Virtue Cider","nameShortDisplay":"Virtue Cider","description":"Virtue works in partnership with local farmers, using the highest quality Midwestern heirloom apples, to produce ciders that combine old world traditions with modern craft cider fermentation and aging techniques.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"EYuZg3","name":"Cigar City Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Cigar City","description":"Cigar City Brewing, makers of Jai Alai IPA and Hunahpu\u2019s Imperial Stout, was founded in 2007 by Joey Redner with the goal of creating quality beer that reflected the flavors and history of the Tampa region.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, \u201cAmerican beers are boring and just are not very satisfying\u201d. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County\u2019s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage\u2019s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo\u2019s, BJ\u2019s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.\r\n\r\nMark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time. Mark's Nut Brown Ale was also celebrated in Michael Jacksons world pocket guide to beer as \u201cworld class\u201d .","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:36:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:35:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DYW1O98USV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HIzVEo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"363 Airport Road","locality":"Oceanside","region":"California","postalCode":"92058","phone":"(760) 705-3221","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":33.2153901,"longitude":-117.3507698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:37:30","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"JbA8ks","name":"Tap and Kitchen","streetAddress":"7060 Miramar Road, Ste 100","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"858-695-9953","website":"http:\/\/legacybrewingtapandkitchen.com","latitude":32.8793454,"longitude":-117.1637115,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-24 07:02:09","updateDate":"2016-05-12 20:33:39","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"C4FUZX","name":"Legal Blonde Lager","nameDisplay":"Legal Blonde Lager","description":"A Munich Lager made with fine malt and superior hops, fermented cold and lagered for a clear, straw-colored body and smooth, refreshing drinkability.","abv":"4.8","ibu":"18","availableId":1,"styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C4FUZX\/upload_5OoiuC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C4FUZX\/upload_5OoiuC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C4FUZX\/upload_5OoiuC-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C4FUZX\/upload_5OoiuC-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C4FUZX\/upload_5OoiuC-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C4FUZX\/upload_5OoiuC-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-22 22:33:20","updateDate":"2018-06-05 05:18:43","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.
