We often brew hybrid styles, combining the features we like from established categories to create new, Island-Of-Doctor-Moreau-style mash-ups.\r\n\r\nFortunate Islands combines the mildly nutty malt body of a wheat beer with the intensely bright, citrusy hoppiness of a righteous IPA. Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches. We hope to release some our more successful experiments in cans and bottles in the coming years.","website":"http:\/\/moderntimesbeer.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RxmG5e\/upload_Lj2ZNL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-05 20:35:32","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:31:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"15J7L2HM86","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"P8CiOe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3725 Greenwood St.","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 546-9694","website":"http:\/\/DrinkModern.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  12:00pm -

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

With an eye toward preserving and growing one-of-a-kind craft beers and brands, CBA was joined by Kona Brewing Company in 2010.\r\nWhen Kurt & Rob Widmer founded Widmer Brothers Brewing in 1984, they didn\u2019t confine their brewing exploration to strict style guidelines. To this day, Widmer Brothers continues to create handcrafted beers with a unique and unconventional twist on traditional styles that are award winning and please a wide range of craft beer lovers.\r\n\r\nRedhook began in a Seattle transmission shop in 1981, and those colorful roots are reflected in the brand\u2019s personality to this day. As one of the country\u2019s first craft breweries, Redhook continues to offer sessionable craft beers to consumers across the country.\r\n\r\nKona Brewing was founded in 1994 by the father and son team of Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who dreamed of crafting fresh, local island brews with spirit, passion and quality. As the largest craft brewery in Hawaii, Kona personifies the laid-back, passionate lifestyle and environmental respect of the people and culture of Hawaii.","website":"http:\/\/craftbrew.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NqX68g","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-331-7270","website":"http:\/\/craftbrewers.com\/","latitude":45.541038,"longitude":-122.6765558,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"buuCTR","name":"Cataqua Public House","streetAddress":"35 Corporate Dr","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"(603) 430-8600","website":"http:\/\/redhook.com\/","latitude":43.0861206,"longitude":-70.8044708,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-20 18:42:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"bPegqO","name":"Redhook Brewery","streetAddress":"14300 NE 145th Street","locality":"Woodinville","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98072","phone":"(425) 483-3232","website":"http:\/\/www.redhook.com","latitude":47.7348275,"longitude":-122.1488713,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-03 15:21:29","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DONtet","name":"Lightwave Belgian Pale","nameDisplay":"Lightwave Belgian Pale","description":"Lightwave Belgian pale Ale features distinctive Trappist yeast characteristics of slightly fruity esters and zesty phenols.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"yXowEG","name":"Stone's Throw Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Stone's Throw","description":"Stone's Throw Brewing is the creation of four guys who met in the local home brew club, the Central Arkansas Fermenters.","website":"http:\/\/www.stonesthrowbeer.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yXowEG\/upload_YTaCLi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yXowEG\/upload_YTaCLi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yXowEG\/upload_YTaCLi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yXowEG\/upload_YTaCLi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yXowEG\/upload_YTaCLi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-01 18:38:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:19:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GVHZ1R6K2I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"yLtQ8y","name":"Stone's Throw Brewing","streetAddress":"402 E 9th St","locality":"Little Rock","region":"Arkansas","postalCode":"72202","phone":"(501) 244-9154","website":"http:\/\/www.stonesthrowbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu-Fri 16:00-21:00\r\nSat-Sun 12:00-18:00","latitude":34.739878,"longitude":-92.26803,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-01 18:40:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu-Fri 16:00-21:00\r\nSat-Sun 12:00-18:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UyISfu","name":"Lil Sipa","nameDisplay":"Lil Sipa","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UyISfu\/upload_cr6IfK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UyISfu\/upload_cr6IfK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UyISfu\/upload_cr6IfK-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UyISfu\/upload_cr6IfK-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UyISfu\/upload_cr6IfK-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UyISfu\/upload_cr6IfK-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-28 11:24:25","updateDate":"2015-12-17 05:41:37","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities.
