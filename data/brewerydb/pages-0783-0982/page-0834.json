Thanks to this crazy new bar in Winnetka, CA and our buddy the bartender, we were introduced to new styles of beer that were much different than the commercial brands we were used to. After many conversations on the process of making beer and the brewing techniques of smaller breweries, we decided to take a chance at brewing our own malted, adult beverages! \r\n\r\nWe signed up for a Maltose Falcons class, bought a brewing kit and a turkey fryer and made a batch of beer on June 23, 2012. After this first batch, we were hooked! We invested more time in learning about the process, fabricated custom brewing equipment and experimented with new recipes while tweaking them to make them our own. \r\n\r\nAfter serving samples of our homemade brews and getting positive feedback, we began talking of doing it legit and opening up a brewery!  Given our Valley roots and the fact our beer was brewed out of a garage in Sylmar, CA, we decided 818 Brewing was the perfect name and we filed our paperwork in October 2014 for our new venture.\r\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ve enjoyed the most along our journey is the sense of community within the craft brew scene. Not many products can bring together men and women of different nationalities, age groups, religious beliefs, income levels, political views \u2013 and even fellow brewers! \u2013 And create a moment of common ground.  8 one 8 Brewing is proud to offer a product that brings us together to say cheers!","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home\/?age-verified=cd0a2fef44","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:30:46","updateDate":"2019-07-02 19:08:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AH21G7RNY4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"GTwDJI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8951 De Soto Ave.","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:31:54","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"73xdsm","name":"8one8 brewery","streetAddress":"8951 de soto ave","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-08-09 23:43:32","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:44","forwardingId":"GTwDJI","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xS2GgM","name":"Indy 11","nameDisplay":"Indy 11","description":"Brewed in tribute to Indy\u2019s first professional soccer team and all of their awesome, supporting fans, this English Pale Ale with orange peel is the perfect game-day beer.","abv":"5","ibu":"40","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xS2GgM\/upload_TyGb8F-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xS2GgM\/upload_TyGb8F-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xS2GgM\/upload_TyGb8F-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xS2GgM\/upload_TyGb8F-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xS2GgM\/upload_TyGb8F-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xS2GgM\/upload_TyGb8F-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-11 20:50:15","updateDate":"2015-12-17 17:11:57","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

These beers will be released in our \u201cLimited Release\u201d series.","website":"http:\/\/www.dryandbitter.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FQ5ySq\/upload_rhojts-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FQ5ySq\/upload_rhojts-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FQ5ySq\/upload_rhojts-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FQ5ySq\/upload_rhojts-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FQ5ySq\/upload_rhojts-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-07 19:47:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FesvNm","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"Borupvej 80","locality":"G\u00f8rl\u00f8se","postalCode":"3330","latitude":55.8926949,"longitude":12.1898569,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DK","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-21 18:36:45","updateDate":"2017-08-29 13:54:59","timezoneId":"Europe\/Copenhagen","country":{"isoCode":"DK","name":"DENMARK","displayName":"Denmark","isoThree":"DNK","numberCode":208,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ATzCkB","name":"Inebriator","nameDisplay":"Inebriator","description":"This dark brown medium bodied beer will blind side you with its intoxicating flavor and aroma.

However, following the clean-up of the river Humber, for the first time in a hundred years the environment is right for the Salmon to return once again to the Ure. Together with local riparian owners, Theakston has committed to a long-term sponsorship programme aimed at recovering the wild salmon stocks to their former glory. As part of the plan, we launched a special commemorative ale, Infallible to raise the profile of this important ecological and environmental work.\r\nInfallible is the name of a famous Salmon fly and as the salmon season begins in early autumn we have designed the beer to be deep amber in colour, using generous amounts of luxurious molasses to give a warm, malty ale scented with very light hop characteristic ideal accompaniment to home-made soups, pork pies and sausages.","abv":"4.2","availableId":4,"styleId":3,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 01:37:12","updateDate":"2015-05-19 17:07:48","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.

While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

Along the way, we\u2019ve made lots of friends and drank our unfair share of good beer, all while trying to do good in our communities and do well as a craft brewery.","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","established":"1998","mailingListUrl":"info@uplandbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:53:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8TCB25H9G6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"esM0Nc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"350 West 11th Street","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812-336-2337","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","latitude":39.1732971,"longitude":-86.5368625,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2017-10-12 13:33:14","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"E3tJa3","name":"Westside Beer Bar","streetAddress":"4060 Profile Pkwy","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812.336.2337","latitude":39.172339,"longitude":-86.586343,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","updateDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-2:00pm-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qNc7jU","name":"Carmel Tap House","streetAddress":"820 E. 116th St.","locality":"Carmel","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46032","phone":"1.317.564.3400","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/locations\/carmel-tap-house\/","latitude":39.9568182,"longitude":-86.1431514,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:10:54","updateDate":"2016-03-01 19:30:44","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ShKvsv","name":"Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"4842 North College Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46205","phone":"1.317.602.3931","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm -

The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wV5Qr3","name":"Inflation Double Wit","nameDisplay":"Inflation Double Wit","abv":"8","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-02 14:06:55","updateDate":"2015-10-02 14:06:55","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"yW9KR5","name":"Taxman Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Taxman","description":"Taxman Brewing Company is dedicated to crafting unique, artisanal Belgian-American ales.
