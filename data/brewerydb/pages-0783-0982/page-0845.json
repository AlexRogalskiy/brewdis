After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:48:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"K240B5MRS1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7KJm9p","name":"IPA X","nameDisplay":"IPA X","description":"IPA X is double dry hopped with Citra and Mosaic hops, an exciting combination that provides big citrus and tropical fruit notes in both aroma and flavor.

Eventually we grew up, moved away, and traveled the country, but there was something about the Shoals and the winding Singing River that kept bringing us back. We returned for First Fridays where we met on a blind date, we got married and had both of our children here, and two years ago we decided to permanently call Florence home after pursuing our dream of opening the first brewery in the Shoals. Today we know it was the river that runs through our small town that taught us to simply enjoy life and make the most of it, and gave us the courage to pursue something that was new and uncertain. Today we brew with the intention that the people drinking Singin\u2019 River Brewing Co. beer on boat docks and around bonfires are gathering to relish life and talk about their dreams for the future.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been drinking Singin\u2019 River beer for the last two years, thank you for all of your support through the ups and downs, experiments, and growth\u2014 but if you\u2019re just now joining us we want you to be a part of our family and invite you to our brewery that feels like a second home. You\u2019ll find comfortable chairs and round tables to chat, and soft, twinkling string lights draped over a long wooden bar to sit and catch up with old friends and to make new. Our goal is to be a gathering place for people to enjoy a cold brew, reminisce about old times, and talk about future aspirations. We love the Shoals, the growth that is happening in this unique town, and we are excited to be contributing to the tourism industry by being a part of the North Alabama Craft Beer Trail. We offer brewery tours and one-of-a-kind locally brewed beer in a place that is rapidly expanding its retail and restaurant scene, and experiencing a musical renaissance. To be the first brewery in the Shoals and be able to partner with other local businesses to see our area thrive is a thrill and an honor. While Rob and I are busy every day with the business side of the brewery to ensure its success, what we love the most is seeing people in the taproom laughing, drinking, and enjoying their favorite beer that was created in the Shoals where they work and play.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nSo far the past two years have been full of milestones, new recipes, and unforgettable parties\u2014and we are excited about our future at Singin\u2019 River Brewing Co. We have added new weekly events including Hops and Hymns on Wednesday nights, as well as Pint Night for UNA faculty, staff, and students on Fridays, and have partnered with local restaurants including Odette, Pie Factory, Rivertown Coffee Co., and 306 BBQ to serve some delicious food for events and weekly gatherings. We always want to serve the Shoals residents, the people who we call family, and create a space that is both inviting and memorable. So, please stop by, say hello, and be a part of our quirky community that is made up of all different kinds of people who simply love beer and good company. The Yuchi Indians said the Tennessee River had a song that was at times soft and quiet, and other times loud and boisterous as it poured over the rocks and reefs of the Shoals\u2013 and we love to celebrate the variety of song that the Singing River brings with our brews for every taste. You will find a full range of beers including the smooth flavor of the Handy\u2019s Gold and the rich, full taste of our Porter\u2013 we hope that you stop by soon and find a beer that strikes a chord.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n- Michelle Jones\r\n\r\n\u200b","website":"https:\/\/www.singinriverbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VxrC7C\/upload_XyENM0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VxrC7C\/upload_XyENM0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VxrC7C\/upload_XyENM0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VxrC7C\/upload_XyENM0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VxrC7C\/upload_XyENM0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:42:40","updateDate":"2019-08-27 11:46:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"X6JUOBMIPS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"XfXF5d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"526 East College Street","locality":"Florence","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35630","phone":"(256) 349-2294","website":"https:\/\/www.singinriverbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSaturday: 2:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSunday: 1:00 \u2013 6:00 PM","latitude":34.8016348,"longitude":-87.6689781,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:42:41","updateDate":"2018-08-17 19:42:41","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 4:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSaturday: 2:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSunday: 1:00 \u2013 6:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6Vo82r","name":"IPAIPA","nameDisplay":"IPAIPA","description":"on tap only","abv":"8.5","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-08 20:28:37","updateDate":"2015-04-08 20:28:37","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Pale and wheat malts along with healthy additions of Equinox and Cascade hops provide the perfect golden base for the addition of papaya. The result is a refreshing IPA with the subtle essence of papaya. Tropical aromas of citrus, passion fruit, and papaya are well complemented by clean malt notes. \r\n\r\nAvailable in 6-packs and on draft from January to April.\r\n\r\nFood pairings; Thai dishes such as Thai salad, pad prik king and tom kha, and Indian dishes such as curry, paneer and samosas. Light fruit-based desserts like Thai sticky rice topped with fresh mango and salted coconut milk. Light blue cheese or a nicely aged triple-creme brie.\r\n\r\nAbout the Pub Series: Like a portal to our pub, seasonal brews only available for a limited time (get \u2019em while they\u2019re cold) give you a taste of the pints and people that celebrate the Pacific Northwest.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
