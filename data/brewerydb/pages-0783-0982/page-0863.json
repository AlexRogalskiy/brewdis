During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:37:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JBEIXAV9NM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mQppv4","name":"Jazz Millions","nameDisplay":"Jazz Millions","abv":"8","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mQppv4\/upload_ykVRFx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mQppv4\/upload_ykVRFx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mQppv4\/upload_ykVRFx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mQppv4\/upload_ykVRFx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mQppv4\/upload_ykVRFx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mQppv4\/upload_ykVRFx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-28 13:34:40","updateDate":"2015-12-17 10:25:24","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

A portion of our sour ales are blended with Summer Oregon fruit like peaches, apricots, strawberries, and cherries. Freshly emptied Bourbon barrels age our imperial stout on ingredients like roasted coffee, vanilla beans, chocolate, and maple syrup.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to brewing creative craft beer, we realize the immense talent within this city. We\u2019ve been inspired by many, in Portland and beyond. We wouldn\u2019t be here without the brewers who came before us, those who took chances, tried something new, and shared their experience.\r\n\r\nThe Great Notion cofounders are: James Dugan, brewing & marketing, Andy Miller, brewing & operations, and Paul Reiter, finance & strategy.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

Featuring Belgian beet sugar, imported aromatic hops, spicy noble hops and pilsner barley, Jeanneke is playful, fruity, crisp and, just as in real life, wonderfully balanced.","abv":"6.2","ibu":"23","srmId":6,"availableId":6,"styleId":61,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-01 15:38:23","updateDate":"2016-03-16 19:28:58","srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state.

(English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)","ibuMin":"28","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.1","abvMax":"4.8","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"0uIMq6","name":"Third Street Aleworks Restaurant & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Third Street Aleworks Restaurant","description":"The Third Street AleWorks\u2019 philosophy about beer and brewing is simple \u2013 use the best ingredients possible; never cut corners; and keep it fresh!","website":"http:\/\/www.thirdstreetaleworks.com","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0uIMq6\/upload_FdNsh6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0uIMq6\/upload_FdNsh6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0uIMq6\/upload_FdNsh6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0uIMq6\/upload_FdNsh6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0uIMq6\/upload_FdNsh6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:49:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QEHKT0BXN6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SZEQ8h","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"610 Third Street","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95404","phone":"707-523-3060","website":"http:\/\/www.thirdstreetaleworks.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday-Thursday: 11:30 AM - Midnight\r\nFriday-Saturday:  11:30 AM - 1:00 AM","latitude":38.439829,"longitude":-122.712481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday-Thursday: 11:30 AM - Midnight\r\nFriday-Saturday:  11:30 AM - 1:00 AM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"e1boyJ","name":"Jelen Belo Pivo","nameDisplay":"Jelen Belo Pivo","abv":"11","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e1boyJ\/upload_NGgo2E-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e1boyJ\/upload_NGgo2E-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e1boyJ\/upload_NGgo2E-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e1boyJ\/upload_NGgo2E-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e1boyJ\/upload_NGgo2E-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e1boyJ\/upload_NGgo2E-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-03 01:12:04","updateDate":"2015-12-17 03:56:29","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"H1L7UE","name":"Apatinska Pivara A.D.","nameShortDisplay":"Apatinska Pivara A.D.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-02 22:15:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"b3TGSz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Trg Oslobo\u0111enja 5","locality":"Apatin","postalCode":"25250","phone":"025783147","latitude":45.6729285,"longitude":18.9765597,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CS","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-03 01:11:24","updateDate":"2017-08-29 13:20:45","timezoneId":"Europe\/Belgrade","country":{"isoCode":"CS","name":"SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO","displayName":"Serbia and Montenegro","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
