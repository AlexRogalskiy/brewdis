Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:33:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QUG9N370X2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lAcrbq","name":"Gadsden","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-5:00pm-9:00pm,thu-5:00pm-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"heKnGb","name":"Birmingham","streetAddress":"3201 1st Avenue North","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"(205) 407-8025","website":"https:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/birmingham","latitude":33.5221355,"longitude":-86.7882994,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-10-14 19:57:28","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-3:00pm-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EnqdNa","name":"Jalapearno","nameDisplay":"Jalapearno","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-25 16:35:26","updateDate":"2017-06-25 16:35:26","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"},"breweries":[{"id":"WGT9NC","name":"Snow Capped Cider","nameShortDisplay":"Snow Capped Cider","description":"Snow Capped Cider is a Colorado based craft cider company.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 22 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"COZL0NR6V3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","timezoneId":"America\/Anchorage","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":6,"name":"Apollo","category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":24,"name":"Centennial","description":"Sometimes called a super Cascade, Centennial was bred in 1974 but not released until 1990.

One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home brew around that time and would share his batches with the Goulets and their friends. What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.
