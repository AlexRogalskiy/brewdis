A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"RoiAq0","name":"Le Trou Du Diable","nameShortDisplay":"Le Trou Du Diable","description":"The Devil's Hole is a place of culinary discovery.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"FPcBi8","name":"Alaro Craft Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Alaro Craft","description":"An award winning brewpub in the heart of Sacramento built on over 30 years of combined brewing experience.

It is always very emotional when Myself and Luca (a solid presence at the Brewery) find ourselves between sour splashes and leftover pieces of fruit that remind me the \u201cvisciole\u201d(morello cherry) my grandfather used to eat while playing cards.\r\n The start is a sour base which has undergone at least 2 years of mixed fermentation with acetic and lactic bacteria as well as Brettanomyces strains. Amarena and morel cherries are then added for additional flavor for at least 6 months. The beer is then blended with part L\u2019Ultima Luna and part young beer and poured into numbered bottles indicating the year of the curvee. 12 more months of maturation in bottle are required before entering the market.\r\n\r\nLa Luna Rossa resembles a Flemish red based kriek beer and is extraordinarily complex and elegant.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"354Wth","name":"Birrificio del Ducato","nameShortDisplay":"Birrificio del Ducato","website":"http:\/\/www.birrificiodelducato.net\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/354Wth\/upload_ulHZF1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-09 17:54:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N7CfsS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Strada Argini","region":"Soragna (PR)","postalCode":"43 43019","phone":"+39 0524 90 137","website":"http:\/\/www.birrificiodelducato.net\/","latitude":44.965514,"longitude":10.2243991,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-10 11:28:37","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IT","name":"ITALY","displayName":"Italy","isoThree":"ITA","numberCode":380,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ghj1La","name":"La Lune Special Ale","nameDisplay":"La Lune Special Ale","description":"A Belgian style special ale brewed with spices and a hint of wheat malt.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"YTOhyg","name":"Four Winds Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Four Winds","description":"Four Winds Brewing Company joined the burgeoning BC craft beer scene and opened their doors to a public thirsty for new local offerings on June 1, 2013.
