Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes \u2013 all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-24 14:45:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Ste-Catherine","streetAddress":"732 Ste-Catherine St. W.","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","phone":"514.788.6333","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.ca\/eng\/ste_catherine.php","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:30 -

These elements are part of the uniqueness of the Farm Brewery Schoune.\r\n\r\nToday still very attached to the flavours and tastes excellence and the love of the product from its conception up to its production and finally distribution of his artisanal beers, the 300 hectares Farm Brewery Schoune is a regional as well world reference for the quality and originality of its products. \r\n\r\nFarm Brewery Schoune exports under the name of O\u2019Canada.","website":"http:\/\/www.schoune.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iXD5XB\/upload_XDvVMJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iXD5XB\/upload_XDvVMJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iXD5XB\/upload_XDvVMJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iXD5XB\/upload_XDvVMJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iXD5XB\/upload_XDvVMJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-13 14:19:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QFcQMV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2075 Chemin Sainte Catherine","locality":"Saint-Polycarpe","region":"Qu\u00e9bec","postalCode":"J0P 1X0","phone":"+1 450-265-3765","website":"http:\/\/www.schoune.com\/","latitude":45.3026898,"longitude":-74.3746712,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-13 18:32:13","updateDate":"2015-03-13 18:32:13","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"8:30am","endTime":"12:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"8:30am","endTime":"12:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"8:30am","endTime":"12:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"8:30am","endTime":"12:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-8:30am-12:00pm,wed-8:30am-12:00pm,thu-8:30am-12:00pm,fri-8:30am-12:00pm,sat-1:00pm-5:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Toronto","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zmonoP","name":"La Blonde","nameDisplay":"La Blonde","description":"La premi\u00e8re bi\u00e8re cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la brasserie, elle en a fait sa r\u00e9putation et demeure la principale production.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

By their second date, it was clear that they would go on to do great things together-- it just took about six years to figure out what those things were. During that time, Rob cultivated his passion and skill for homebrewing and received an Associates Degree in Brewing Science from the Siebel Institute.  Then, with full support from Ali, he started an invaluable internship at Port Jeff Brewing Company in Long Island. \r\n\r\nIt was a long commute from Brooklyn, and even longer work hours, but Rob's love for brewing only grew. His passion rubbed off on Ali, who had over the years become a self-professed beer snob, and she began reading up on the business side of brewing. Eventually it became clear that the two would open their own brewery.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y61SYo","name":"Brasserie de Saint-Louis","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie de Saint-Louis","website":"http:\/\/www.saint-louis.biz\/","mailingListUrl":"contact@saint-louis.biz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y61SYo\/upload_KldcO8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y61SYo\/upload_KldcO8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y61SYo\/upload_KldcO8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y61SYo\/upload_KldcO8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y61SYo\/upload_KldcO8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-14 19:53:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IxKKct","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"123 Rue de Mulhouse","region":"Saint-Louis","postalCode":"68300","phone":"33 (0) 3.89.91.04.58","latitude":47.5977218,"longitude":7.5531204,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FR","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-18 17:54:03","updateDate":"2015-05-18 17:54:03","timezoneId":"Europe\/Paris","country":{"isoCode":"FR","name":"FRANCE","displayName":"France","isoThree":"FRA","numberCode":250,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pNYJqs","name":"La Buffalo Riding","nameDisplay":"La Buffalo Riding","abv":"8","ibu":"66","srmId":33,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-16 18:49:34","updateDate":"2015-03-14 19:52:48","srm":{"id":33,"name":"33","hex":"520907"},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.
