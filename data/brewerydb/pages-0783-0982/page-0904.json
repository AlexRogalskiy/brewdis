Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA. We are servicing several local restaurants, pubs and distributers. Levante aims to deliver a variety of creative brews to beer lovers in Philadelphia's western suburbs and beyond.","website":"http:\/\/www.levantebrewing.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-19 12:29:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:48:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QJLE5I6T1S","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"niIUKb","name":"Levante Brewing Company","streetAddress":"208 Carter Dr","extendedAddress":"Suite 2","locality":"West Chester","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19382","latitude":39.9489353,"longitude":-75.5879947,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-19 12:30:17","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:57:19","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oKiDt4","name":"K\u00f6lsch","nameDisplay":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"The classic Gaffel Koelsch is a particularly fresh speciality beer from Cologne, brewed according to a time-honoured family recipe and the German Purity Law of 1516 with water, malt, hops, and hops extract.\r\n\r\nThe delicately bitter, pleasant, slightly hopsy taste is characteristic of this traditional product and clearly distinguishes Gaffel Koelsch from all other Koelsch brands.","abv":"4.8","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:34","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:41","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).

Ours is a \"brewers' brewery\", with an uncompromising focus on beer quality.\r\n\r\n From the beginning, our goal was to make beers that we liked to drink. All of our beers are served up unfiltered and long-aged, to deliver maximum flavor and character. The beers can be very complex and assertive, but with the ultimate goal of proper balance. We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.\r\n\r\n In June of 2013, Matt purchased Charlie's shares of Double Mountain, vowing to continue the good work the two partners created.","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001nxNUBQroFr3hjq6FYVwFkkyCOBhaGExXaxrZhqC8w77l41A-A2WhADmLcObiDpQkWRv_aW3ZWsS2PPug8oPv5xCH8VvV78Ga","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:17:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9XZOTHG3QJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"4kMvnC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8 Fourth Street","locality":"Hood River","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97031","phone":"541-387-0042","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.7099797,"longitude":-121.5144842,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OAnNVF","name":"Double Mountain Taproom","streetAddress":"4336 Woodstock Blvd","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97206","phone":"(503) 206-5495","website":"www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.4789106,"longitude":-122.6177216,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:05","updateDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":98,"name":"Perle (American)","description":"Bred in Germany from Northern Brewer, Perle was an attempt at a higher-alpha replacement for Hallertauer Mittelfr?her.
