The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits.

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"wfAwfx","name":"BrewDog","nameShortDisplay":"BrewDog","description":"BrewDog is a Scottish craft brewery located in the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBrewDog was founded in 2006 by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Whatever your second profession is, it's safe to assume it's where your true passion and free time intersect.\r\n\r\nBeer has been brewed for thousands of years and has been a great unifier for communities of people. Second Profession Brewing Company is an extension of that rich history; to unite the people who dream, who stay up late when they have to get up early, the mothers and fathers going for a run pushing a stroller. To us, this is what beer is all about: It's the ability to unite people of all backgrounds around a common interest, where dreams and aspirations are shared.\r\n\r\nNo one on their deathbed has ever wished they spent more time at the office.\r\n\r\nSecond Profession Brewing Company is our embodiment of this ideal. Over the last three years, we have dreamed big, burned the midnight oil, and made our second profession crafting and creating beer that we believe in and that fulfills our passion.\r\n\r\nWe are so much more than just people who love beer (which we do): We are the culmination of our 10,000 hours of learning\u2014about beer, business, and more importantly, about ourselves. For us, beer is the embodiment of all of our interactions. Ask almost anyone what kind of beer they like and you will likely get a visceral answer in return; it's a beautiful thing to witness. This is because beer is so much more than something you drink\u2014it's about people, it's about culture, it's about your interaction with everyone around you, it's about letting go of the bad things in your life if only just for a moment. It's about the experiences we share with the people we love.\r\n\r\nWe are so grateful for the people who continue to inspire us to move forward in spite of the inherent challenges presented along the way. We appreciate you from the bottoms of our hearts and the bottoms of our glasses.","website":"http:\/\/www.secondprofessionbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jHTncD\/upload_9ovbtP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jHTncD\/upload_9ovbtP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jHTncD\/upload_9ovbtP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jHTncD\/upload_9ovbtP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jHTncD\/upload_9ovbtP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:43:32","updateDate":"2019-08-14 14:43:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8F2V6UH1SW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kz9qae","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5846 Northeast Sandy Boulevard","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97213","phone":"(503) 288-5882","website":"http:\/\/www.secondprofessionbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 9:00 PM","latitude":45.5427149,"longitude":-122.6028096,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:43:34","updateDate":"2018-08-17 19:43:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 9:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rGNzZ0","name":"IPA Unleashed","nameDisplay":"IPA Unleashed","description":"A classic IPA brewed to exacting standards \u2013 this is what an IPA should taste like.
