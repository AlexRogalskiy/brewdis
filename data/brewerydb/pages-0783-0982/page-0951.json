There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@chandeleurbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:59:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"URFJYGW2P0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"n7K72G","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2711 14th Street","locality":"Gulfport","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39501","phone":"228-701-9985","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","latitude":30.367822,"longitude":-89.09537,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-03-13 17:16:03","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"4:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-7:00pm,fri-4:00pm-7:00pm,sat-1:00pm-4:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pCaNH0","name":"Lil' Nug","nameDisplay":"Lil' Nug","abv":"5.25","styleId":108,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-03 16:51:52","updateDate":"2014-09-05 19:18:15","style":{"id":108,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Session Beer","shortName":"Session","description":"Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"7VPQrN","name":"Sixpoint Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Sixpoint","description":"Sixpoint Craft Ales was founded in 2004 by Shane Welch, a former homebrewer that originally grew up in Milwaukee.

Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@chandeleurbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:59:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"URFJYGW2P0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"n7K72G","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2711 14th Street","locality":"Gulfport","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39501","phone":"228-701-9985","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","latitude":30.367822,"longitude":-89.09537,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-03-13 17:16:03","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"4:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-7:00pm,fri-4:00pm-7:00pm,sat-1:00pm-4:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5nbflG","name":"Lil' Squeezy","nameDisplay":"Lil' Squeezy","description":"Kick back with a breezy blend of juicy hops and delicate malt character that\u2019s dripping with fresh citrus flavors and zesty aroma.

Raise your glasses for the OG, and toast to the creatives and leaders among us.","abv":"5.5","styleId":114,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CmZlx7\/upload_eG7Uho-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CmZlx7\/upload_eG7Uho-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CmZlx7\/upload_eG7Uho-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CmZlx7\/upload_eG7Uho-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CmZlx7\/upload_eG7Uho-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/CmZlx7\/upload_eG7Uho-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-20 14:49:27","updateDate":"2019-06-20 14:50:26","style":{"id":114,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Wheat Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Fruit Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.

You know, back when you would get excited when your bottle shop would get in some world-class beers from Belgium. Nothing too fancy, just a beer that has been dialed in over the last hundred and fifty years or so, essentially making it impossible for us to make something better in our lifetime. Our humble attempt at doing justice to the style is Lilith, a Belgian Golden Ale that is as simple in concept as it is complex in flavor. Aromas are primarily yeast-driven with bright notes of citrus peel, fresh cut grass, flower gardens, and a spicy finish with white pepper, coriander, and tea leaf. Start to finish, this strong Golden Ale is a showcase of restraint and admiration, letting the classic ingredients shine and doing our best to stay out of their way. Prickly carbonation rips the subtle bready and doughy flavors off your taste buds and mixes them around with a balanced hop bitterness and grassy floral notes that tie everything together. We highly suggest coming in and grabbing a glass of Lilith Belgian Golden Ale and savoring all of its subtleties, then come back in 150 years and try it again and see if we accomplished our goal of making a beer worthy of our idols in Belgium","abv":"8","styleId":61,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-11-10 14:14:47","updateDate":"2017-11-10 14:14:47","style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
