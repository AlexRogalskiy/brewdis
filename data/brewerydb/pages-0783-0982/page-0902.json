Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc\u2026) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).

At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"80ewUQ","name":"Saku \u00d5lletehas","nameShortDisplay":"Saku \u00d5lletehas","description":"The brewing traditions of Saku Brewery reach back to the beginning of the 19th century.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"BCPuYp","name":"Fat Head's Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Fat Head's","description":"Full-scale production brewery offering award-winning beers on tap, tasty grub, guided tours and live entertainment.","website":"http:\/\/www.fatheads.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:54:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ST92BCAJQ8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"M5VpZt","name":"Cleveland","streetAddress":"24581 Lorain Rd","locality":"North Olmsted","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44070","phone":"(440) 801-1001","website":"http:\/\/fatheads.com\/","latitude":41.426338,"longitude":-81.8942255,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-06-11 14:39:45","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dh7I4h","name":"Saloon","streetAddress":"1805 E Carson St","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15203","phone":"(412) 431-7433","website":"http:\/\/www.fatheadspittsburgh.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon -

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H05RKIPET3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content. Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"r2tI7b","name":"Sweetwater Tavern and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Sweetwater Tavern","website":"http:\/\/greatamericanrestaurants.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2019-03-05 20:58:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AEJSLW62NF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kLZZgK","name":"Sweetwater Sterling","streetAddress":"45980 Waterview Plaza","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"571-434-6500","website":"http:\/\/www.greatamericanrestaurants.com\/sweetMainSter\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday & Monday: 11:00am-10:00pm\r\nTuesday \u2013 Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11:00am-12:00am","latitude":39.032556,"longitude":-77.409609,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday & Monday: 11:00am-10:00pm\r\nTuesday \u2013 Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11:00am-12:00am","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IRMmi5","name":"Sweetwater Centreville","streetAddress":"14250 Sweetwater Lane","locality":"Centreville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20121","phone":"703-449-1100","website":"http:\/\/www.greatamericanrestaurants.com\/sweetMainCen\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday \u2013 Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm\r\nFriday \u2013 Saturday: 11:00am-12:00am\r\nSunday \u2013 Monday: 11:00am-10:00pm","latitude":38.82891,"longitude":-77.439469,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-21 11:33:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tuesday \u2013 Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm\r\nFriday \u2013 Saturday: 11:00am-12:00am\r\nSunday \u2013 Monday: 11:00am-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ul5arW","name":"Sweetwater Merrifield","streetAddress":"3066 Gatehouse Plaza","locality":"Falls Church","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22042","phone":"703-645-8100","website":"http:\/\/www.greatamericanrestaurants.com\/sweetMainMeri\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Monday: 11:00am-10:00pm\r\nTuesday - Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm\r\nFriday - Saturday: 11:00am-12:00am\r\nThe bar closes one hour after the dining room.","latitude":38.866622,"longitude":-77.229157,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-21 11:34:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Monday: 11:00am-10:00pm\r\nTuesday - Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm\r\nFriday - Saturday: 11:00am-12:00am\r\nThe bar closes one hour after the dining room.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
