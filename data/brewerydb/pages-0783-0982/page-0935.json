Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

The overall flavour balance favours the impression of juicy, resinous hops supported by a solid malt backbone. This strong ale is robust, but the alcohol remains well integrated.","abv":"7.1","ibu":"60","availableId":2,"styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tHCLvN\/upload_p3L5Gb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tHCLvN\/upload_p3L5Gb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tHCLvN\/upload_p3L5Gb-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tHCLvN\/upload_p3L5Gb-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tHCLvN\/upload_p3L5Gb-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tHCLvN\/upload_p3L5Gb-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Black pepper seared striploin with BBQ sauce, lamb vindaloo, charcuterie like prosciutto & dry cured salami, 70% chocolate pudding cakes, Strong, dry bleu cheese like Glengarry Celtic blue or Ermite from Quebec , raw milk cheddar","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.065","createDate":"2015-03-01 19:11:47","updateDate":"2016-05-19 12:44:14","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"LFkVMc","name":"Brewery Vivant","nameShortDisplay":"Brewery Vivant","description":"Brewery Vivant is the realization of years of dreaming and much discussion of what a great brewery can be.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BrdDt6","name":"Le Git Saison","nameDisplay":"Le Git Saison","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BrdDt6\/upload_jTaeaT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BrdDt6\/upload_jTaeaT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BrdDt6\/upload_jTaeaT-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BrdDt6\/upload_jTaeaT-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BrdDt6\/upload_jTaeaT-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BrdDt6\/upload_jTaeaT-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-03 17:52:30","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:13:37","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

We strive to bring an authentic and pleasant experience to all of our customers through our unique ales and lagers.","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","established":"1985","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ORN90Y51W8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"NnffJ2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8938 Krum Ave.","locality":"Galesburg","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49053","phone":"269-382-2338","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","latitude":42.2843486,"longitude":-85.4538497,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1985","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-25 20:15:04","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"uCUre7","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E Kalamazoo Ave","locality":"Kalamazoo","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49007","website":"http:\/\/bellsbeer.com\/eccentric-cafe\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","latitude":42.2949613,"longitude":-85.5789817,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-26 11:44:59","updateDate":"2015-05-06 15:19:37","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Y0IatW","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E.

Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"XFIYq7","name":"Knotty Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Knotty Brewing","description":"Downtown- San Diego, CA \r\n\r\nLocal Brewery focussed on bringing our takes on our favorite old world beers to the thirsty people of San Diego.
