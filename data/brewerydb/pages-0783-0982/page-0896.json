A better product that not only tastes great, but is also made in a responsible and sustainable way. We use 100% organic 2-Row in all of our beers and each of our beers is comprised of at least 90% organic ingredients. No genetic modification, no pesticides, no BS just great beer.\r\n\r\nREUSE, RECYCLE & REDUCE\r\n\r\nElbow grease is an understatement to how we built our brewery. We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?\r\n\r\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER?\r\n\r\nWe want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you.

Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"9ZywUy","name":"Hairless Hare Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Hairless Hare","website":"http:\/\/www.hairlessharebrewery.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9ZywUy\/upload_MqFsTC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9ZywUy\/upload_MqFsTC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9ZywUy\/upload_MqFsTC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9ZywUy\/upload_MqFsTC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9ZywUy\/upload_MqFsTC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-26 04:50:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:19:40","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"XEH6V1A8GQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"EyfTAr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"738 West National Road","locality":"Vandalia","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45377","phone":"(937) 387-6476","website":"http:\/\/www.hairlessharebrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.889582,"longitude":-84.213696,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-28 11:33:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 6:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gMqrAS","name":"KINGS WEIZEN","nameDisplay":"KINGS WEIZEN","description":"Royal Bavaria\u2019s Weizen or \u201cWheat\u201d beer has a very characteristic flavor that is produced by the interplay between the Weissbier ale yeasts and the trace elements from the large portion of wheat in the brew\u2019s grain bill.

Now a decade and a half later, armed with solid experience, the breadth of our creative momentum continues to grow and we are releasing at least one new cider a month. \r\n\r\nThis year has been the year we decided to let the fantastic Moutere terroir shine through unhindered and we have ditched the packets of commercial yeasts.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to explore what cider can be. The possibilities are endless.","website":"https:\/\/www.peckhams.co.nz\/about","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-27 20:33:37","updateDate":"2019-08-23 10:42:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0XNcUK","name":"Peckham's Cidery and Orchard","streetAddress":"127 Neudorf Road","region":"Upper Moutere","postalCode":"7175","latitude":-41.248697,"longitude":172.9931881,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-27 20:37:07","updateDate":"2018-06-27 20:37:30","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1auT3H","name":"Kingstown Red","nameDisplay":"Kingstown Red","abv":"5","ibu":"25","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-02-27 18:22:03","updateDate":"2017-02-27 18:42:43","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber\/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"T5BA340M8O","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QkdgSV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1430 North 7th Street","locality":"Murphysboro","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"62966","phone":"(618) 684-8833","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","latitude":37.7823381,"longitude":-89.3321145,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CaSZi0","name":"Kinkajou","nameDisplay":"Kinkajou","abv":"5.2","ibu":"11","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-05 15:49:36","updateDate":"2016-04-05 15:49:36","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.
