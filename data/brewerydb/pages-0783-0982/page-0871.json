This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"YHij73","name":"Deschutes Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Deschutes","description":"Family and employee owned since 1988, Deschutes Brewery \u2013 Bend\u2019s original brewpub \u2013 has become the cornerstone of Central Oregon\u2019s legacy craft brew culture.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

Thus, Maxlrain is and remains a local private brewery under independent management. The fifteen styles of beer classified under pale ale, dark ale, Pils or wheat beer are all brewed applying manual skills utilizing finest ingredients enhanced by our own source of spring water drawn from the Mangfall Valley.","website":"http:\/\/www.maxlrain.de\/","established":"1636","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-30 20:25:26","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1CemsR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Aiblinger Str. 1","locality":"Maxlrain","region":"Tuntenhausen","postalCode":"83104","phone":"+49 (0)8061 \/ 9079-0","website":"http:\/\/www.maxlrain.de\/en\/","latitude":47.89838,"longitude":11.98821,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-08 17:12:19","updateDate":"2016-04-04 20:03:54","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PkpPnY","name":"Jubilaum 10","nameDisplay":"Jubilaum 10","description":"This auburn colored Bavarian beauty opens with warm spicy, nutty notes, followed by luscious wheat and barley maltiness, and just a smidgen of hops for balance.

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"2ONHw4","name":"Alewerks Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Alewerks","description":"AleWerks Brewing Company is located in the heart of the early colonies in Williamsburg, Virginia.

Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and\/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt\/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"8.8","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:43"},"breweries":[{"id":"ausxy3","name":"Pecan Street Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Pecan Street","description":"Pecan Street Brewing and Restaurant \u2014 a place to visit with old friends and make new ones!

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
