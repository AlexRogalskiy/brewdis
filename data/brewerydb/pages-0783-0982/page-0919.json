A very low degree of malt sweetness may be present and in balance with the acidity produced by Lactobacillus activity. Oak-like or woody characters may be pleasantly integrated into overall palate.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"pzWq1r","name":"Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Jolly Pumpkin","description":"Welcome to a land of open fermentation, oak barrel aging, and bottle conditioning.

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"MAWexQ","name":"Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles","description":"It was in 2000 that the traditional brewery Rulles was created by Gregory Verhelst, brewer engineer originally from Tournai.

Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"ySo6qj","name":"Les Brasseurs du Temps","nameShortDisplay":"Les Brasseurs du Temps","website":"http:\/\/www.brasseursdutemps.com\/en\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-14 00:23:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mmKVhK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"170 Rue Montcalm","locality":"Gatineau","region":"Quebec","postalCode":"J8X 2M2","website":"http:\/\/Www.brasseursdutemps.com","latitude":45.4297502,"longitude":-75.7268567,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-14 00:23:55","updateDate":"2017-08-22 16:59:18","timezoneId":"America\/Toronto","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"q5fdO1","name":"La Semeuse Espresso Stout","nameDisplay":"La Semeuse Espresso Stout","abv":"7.5","styleId":20,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-28 15:05:33","updateDate":"2015-05-28 15:05:33","style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

This batch is quite complex. The aroma of the Malbec is very noticable, lots of oak flavours from medium toast, and vanilla and almond from high toast barrels, floral aromas from Acasia and obviously the beer aromas from the quadrupel. Very robust and rich in tannins, which warrants a bit of extra maturation in the bottle to let the complexity increase and the flavour become rounder. While the red wine influence is noticable, the wood has the dominant note. A must for everyone who likes heavy beer and\/or wine with lots of wood flavour and aroma. 55% Used Malbec barrels 20% New French oak, medium toast 20% New French oak, high toast 5% Acacia wood.","abv":"10","styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZONpPv\/upload_MKruf1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZONpPv\/upload_MKruf1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZONpPv\/upload_MKruf1-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZONpPv\/upload_MKruf1-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZONpPv\/upload_MKruf1-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZONpPv\/upload_MKruf1-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-31 15:21:41","updateDate":"2015-12-17 16:43:15","style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.
