Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels.

We all love craft beer, good wine and great food \u2013 especially from local producers. Hard cider began popping up in the craft beer cases around town. Local hard cider production in North Carolina and across the country was starting to take off. So we asked ourselves \u2013 why not Atlanta? Our home city has a vibrant farm-to-table restaurant scene, and more than 60 farmers markets. North Georgia has robust apple production. Craft cocktails, small-scale craft breweries and local restaurants dominate growth in the city. We would jump on the chance to taste a locally made hard cider, so why didn\u2019t we make it ourselves?\r\nSo it began. We carefully considered where in Atlanta to base our business, and ended up just where some of our partners grew up \u2013 Marietta. We leveraged years of home-based cider making, and started figuring out how to make the best cider \u2013 clean, refreshing and pleasantly sweet, while avoiding the cloying taste and heavy back-sweetening found in most national brands.\r\nTreehorn Cider is available in restaurants, bars and growler shops throughout Georgia. We love talking and thinking about cider, and above all making cider that you can drink with any meal, any time. It\u2019s become our passion, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunity to share it with you!","website":"http:\/\/www.treehorncider.com\/","mailingListUrl":"info@treehorncider.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/epip51\/upload_bnFkcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 15:23:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"4L4XMU","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"1395 S Marietta Pkwy SE, Bldg 100, Ste 130","locality":"Marietta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30067","phone":"+1 678-717-8434","website":"http:\/\/www.treehorncider.com","latitude":33.941684,"longitude":-84.5124605,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 15:28:24","updateDate":"2016-02-17 15:28:24","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"m6UPo3","name":"Hoppy Looking Unfiltered IPA","nameDisplay":"Hoppy Looking Unfiltered IPA","description":"The next iteration of Evo's unfiltered IPA series.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"b6oU3L","name":"Urban Family Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Urban Family","description":"We are a family-run brewery located in the heart of Ballard, Seattle.","website":"http:\/\/www.urbanfamilybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:02:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"NUSO3P86QB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"bQ8Tb6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4441 26th Ave W Suite A","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98199","phone":"(206) 861-6769","website":"http:\/\/www.urbanfamilybrewing.com\/","latitude":47.6605583,"longitude":-122.3899516,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-01-27 18:20:15","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3eV7Uq","name":"Hoppy M\u00e4rzen","nameDisplay":"Hoppy M\u00e4rzen","description":"This Amber Lager is dry-hopped with copious amounts of H\u00fcll Melon hops, Mandarina Bavaria hops notes of melon and citrus give this marzen a beautiful aroma while not being overly bitter.","abv":"6.4","ibu":"40","styleId":102,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-01-07 13:13:17","updateDate":"2019-01-07 13:13:17","style":{"id":102,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style M\u00e4rzen \/ Oktoberfest","shortName":"American Oktoberfest","description":"The American style of these classic German beers is distinguished by a comparatively greater degree of hop character.
