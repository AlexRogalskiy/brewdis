We currently distribute our beer throughout Arkansas and Mississippi. Our styles of beer are produced in the old time honored traditional methods of European brewers, using only two-row malted barley, hops, yeast and great Arkansas water. Being brewed locally gives the beer a great advantage in \"freshness\" while still capturing some of the worlds most famous styles of beer without the use of adjuncts or preservatives!\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering where our name came from. Diamond Bear is brewed in Arkansas which is the only state to have a diamond mine. This is where the first part of our name came from. As for the bear portion of Diamond Bear, Arkansas was once home to a large population of bears. In fact, during the pioneer days Arkansas was known as the \"Bear State.\" Therefore, we combined the two to create a name that is distinctly Arkansan, Diamond Bear!","website":"http:\/\/www.diamondbear.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:19:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ATW6VKGJQY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cnIhzJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"600 N Broadway","locality":"North Little Rock","region":"Arkansas","postalCode":"72114","phone":"501-708-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.diamondbear.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday - Thursday 11am-9pm\r\nFriday - Saturday 11am-10pm\r\nSunday - 11am-9pm\r\nMonday - CLOSED","latitude":34.759269,"longitude":-92.272261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tuesday - Thursday 11am-9pm\r\nFriday - Saturday 11am-10pm\r\nSunday - 11am-9pm\r\nMonday - CLOSED","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hHeIRs","name":"Irish Red","nameDisplay":"Irish Red","abv":"6","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-04 15:11:15","updateDate":"2015-06-11 15:05:53","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!\r\n\r\nEngine 15 \u2013 Eat, Drink, Brew!","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:01:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TABYSFRXM4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"E6WUse","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1500 Beach Blvd","locality":"Jacksonville Beach","region":"Florida","postalCode":"32250","phone":"904-249-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":30.287586,"longitude":-81.4081999,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QYsYqQ","name":"Irish Red","nameDisplay":"Irish Red","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-05 20:28:12","updateDate":"2015-11-05 20:28:12","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N39Q0L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2004 Capitol Avenue","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95814","phone":"916-448-7032","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","latitude":38.573116,"longitude":-121.480958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1987","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sTKt2K","name":"Irish Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Irish Red Ale","description":"Our Irish Red keeps true to the malty finish of a traditional Irish Red.
