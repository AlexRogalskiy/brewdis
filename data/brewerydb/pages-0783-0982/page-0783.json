But while Matt\u2019s beer was incredible, his business plan was not (at least according to the banks) and nobody would lend him the money to start the brewery.\r\nUndaunted, he grabbed credit card applications on the way out, filled them out the same day, and opened Phillips Brewing Company on a mountain of credit card debt.  What palatial brewing fortress did this high-interest financing purchase? A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.  We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility\u2013the only one of its kind in Canada.  The same renegade passion and creativity that drove a young brewer to start a brewery on credit cards continues to be the driving force everything that we do today.","website":"http:\/\/www.phillipsbeer.com","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 07:07:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vTSRcK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2010 Government St.","locality":"Victoria","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V8T 4P1","phone":"250 380-1912","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","latitude":48.4326736,"longitude":-123.3673092,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 15:06:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rDVH2k","name":"Hoperbolic Helles","nameDisplay":"Hoperbolic Helles","abv":"6.2","ibu":"20","styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-04-24 18:10:32","updateDate":"2019-04-24 18:10:32","style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"1yMrDb","name":"Outliers Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Outliers","description":"Exceptional Indiana Beer","website":"http:\/\/www.outliersbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1yMrDb\/upload_TEDjLS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1yMrDb\/upload_TEDjLS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1yMrDb\/upload_TEDjLS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1yMrDb\/upload_TEDjLS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1yMrDb\/upload_TEDjLS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-17 17:09:35","updateDate":"2019-09-04 14:01:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FbJSGN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"534 E North St","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46204","website":"http:\/\/www.outliersbrewing.com","latitude":39.775265,"longitude":-86.1474455,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-17 17:10:06","updateDate":"2019-09-04 14:01:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"X5EKhp","name":"Hopewells","nameDisplay":"Hopewells","abv":"5.8","ibu":"35","srmId":41,"styleId":21,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.077","createDate":"2015-06-22 21:25:08","updateDate":"2015-06-22 21:25:09","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer important how advanced we are and how much technical support we use during our daily processes. The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: \"Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served\" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","established":"1590","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vPPBkD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Schlossbr\u00e4ugasse 2","locality":"Au in der Hallertau","postalCode":"84072","phone":"+49 \/ 87 52 \/ 86 32","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","latitude":48.558307,"longitude":11.741228,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","yearOpened":"1590","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9OQmjK","name":"Hopfen Houblon","nameDisplay":"Hopfen Houblon","description":"Deep down in cellar 26, this refreshing Blonde is cold-hopped with Hallertauer hops.

Garrett had always admired the delicate balance of flavors in Schneider Weisse, while Hans-Peter had long enjoyed the effusive hop character of Brooklyn East India Pale Ale and BLAST! Garrett\u2019s concept for the collaboration was that each brewmaster would brew essentially the same pale, hoppy weissbock in the other\u2019s brewery, but with different hopping to reflect the local hop flavor.\r\n\r\nGarrett traveled to the 400 yr-old Schneider brewery in Kelheim, Germany, to brew Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse. This was dry-hopped with the local Hallertauer Saphir hop variety. A couple months later, Drexler brought his yeast to Brooklyn and brewed Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse, choosing the American Amarillo and Palisade varieties for the dry-hopping. The beer has a full orange color and the aromatics pair the banana and clove notes from the Schneider yeast with the mango and citrus qualities of the hops. The bitterness is robust but balanced, and the beer has a clean, hoppy finish.","abv":"7.8","glasswareId":9,"availableId":3,"styleId":53,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Caribbean seafood preparations, crab cakes, jerk chicken, Thai cuisine, Szechuan cooking and many Mexican dishes.","originalGravity":"1.078","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:25","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":53,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Weizenbock \/ Weissbock","shortName":"Weizenbock","description":"This style can be either pale or dark (golden to dark brown in color) and has a high starting gravity and alcohol content.

For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer important how advanced we are and how much technical support we use during our daily processes. The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: \"Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served\" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","established":"1590","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_3mRY8z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vPPBkD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Schlossbr\u00e4ugasse 2","locality":"Au in der Hallertau","postalCode":"84072","phone":"+49 \/ 87 52 \/ 86 32","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","latitude":48.558307,"longitude":11.741228,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","yearOpened":"1590","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Viohyb","name":"Hopfenk\u00f6nig","nameDisplay":"Hopfenk\u00f6nig","abv":"5.1","glasswareId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 22:43:22","updateDate":"2013-05-09 22:00:42","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

This one is called Hopfenpop and will start shipping to accounts on Monday August 3rd.\r\nWe are calling this a \u201cpre-prohibition double IPA\u201d, part of a new series we\u2019re calling \u201cNever Upon a Time\u201d.\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d, you ask? Well, it\u2019s because we did an old-school, big boy cereal mash to give it exceptionally light body (for an 8% abv beer). A cereal mash uses corn grits, which are not really a craft brewing thing. In fact, we couldn\u2019t buy them from any of our regular suppliers, such is their \u201cbig beer\u201d stigma. Well, they have their uses! (one of which in this case was clogging up our lauter tun big time\u2026 but we\u2019ll come to that). The use of a cereal mash allows us to bring down the color and body of the beer, while keeping the ABV and allowing us to hop the beer \u201cstupidly.\u201d\r\nSo, we present to you a pale yellow, 8% abv, low bodied, refreshing, double IPA. The words refreshing and double IPA don\u2019t ordinarily go together, but we think you will agree they do here.\r\nThe hops are Mosaic and Sorachi Ace. And there\u2019s plenty of them. High aroma, fairly high bitterness.\r\nA good high-summer, hot-as-mars kind of a beer.\r\nThe name, of course, is Germany-inspired, and we might wear our lederhosen to the launch party.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005.

Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jkUlwv","name":"Hopfordian IPA","nameDisplay":"Hopfordian IPA","abv":"6","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jkUlwv\/upload_u7zm1k-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jkUlwv\/upload_u7zm1k-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jkUlwv\/upload_u7zm1k-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jkUlwv\/upload_u7zm1k-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jkUlwv\/upload_u7zm1k-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jkUlwv\/upload_u7zm1k-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-17 19:32:01","updateDate":"2018-04-26 20:31:08","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
