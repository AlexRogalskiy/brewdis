For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"4EddPR","name":"Hirschbr\u00e4u","nameShortDisplay":"Hirschbr\u00e4u","website":"http:\/\/www.hirschbraeu.de\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"smwzAy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Gr\u00fcntenstra\u00dfe 7","locality":"Sonthofen","region":"Bavaria","postalCode":"87527","latitude":47.496718,"longitude":10.236229,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-15 14:29:38","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tww1Na","name":"Kupono Captain's Ale","nameDisplay":"Kupono Captain's Ale","description":"Kupono Captain's Ale is an American Blonde Ale, light bodied and brewed to be enjoyed during hot summer evenings at a match, or any time.

This, to us, means the comprehensive enjoyment of beer in a way that enhances the overall experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula for our entire lineup of hand-crafted Baird Beer is the same: Balance + Complexity = Character. We are dedicated to the crafting of beer that bursts with flavor and character. We will not brew vapid beer and we are not afraid of not appealing to everyone. We brew to our own exacting standards and it is our daily mission to not disappoint ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting Baird Beer, we also own and directly operate a growing stable of beer pubs which we call our Taprooms (Numazu Fishmarket Taproom, Nakameguro Taproom, etc.). Baird Beer also is sold through a steadily expanding family of outside pubs, restaurants and liquor stores in Japan as well as being exported to select international markets. Consumer purchases of Baird Beer direct from the brewery are possible through our online estore (delivery only within Japan).","website":"http:\/\/bairdbeer.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_pLnaal-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_pLnaal-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_pLnaal-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_pLnaal-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_pLnaal-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AzIZR4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9-3, Tadehara-cho","locality":"Numazu","region":"Shizuoka","postalCode":"410-0843","phone":"055-952-6673","website":"http:\/\/bairdbeer.com\/","latitude":35.082445,"longitude":138.861084,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yfhCRR","name":"Kuronama","nameDisplay":"Kuronama","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:34","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:48","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nxkuA4","name":"Kwingston's Kitty Cat-ina","nameDisplay":"Kwingston's Kitty Cat-ina","description":"Brewed with Agave Nectar, smoked wheat, lime, orange zest, and salt.","abv":"9","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nxkuA4\/upload_ncJCpx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nxkuA4\/upload_ncJCpx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nxkuA4\/upload_ncJCpx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nxkuA4\/upload_ncJCpx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nxkuA4\/upload_ncJCpx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nxkuA4\/upload_ncJCpx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-14 17:02:48","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:05:03","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

After the aging period, the different casks are blended together in order to obtain complexity and lots of flavors.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

Love them !\r\n\r\nL\u2019Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien is an antique beer, a strong sour ale with 11% abv aged in old wine oak barrels during one year. After the aging period, the different casks are blended together in order to obtain complexity and lots of flavors. St Bon-Chien is one of the world's flagship's sour beers coming from a mixed fermentation. It first ferments with wine yeast, then during the cask's maturation, lots of microorganisms coming from the casks change  the beer's flavors' profile.\r\n\r\nThe best way to enjoy a good Bon-Chien is to serve it in a kind of wine glass or a Teku at about 16\u00b0C or 60.6\u00b0F paired with a duck breast or some panned foie gras for example. Don't hesitate to keep some bottles in your cellar and age it, I can remember a fantastic Bon-Chien 2004 that we shared with some friend after 9 years ... \r\n\r\nOh, I forgot it : Bon-Chien (Good Dog) was the first brewery's cat and she got holyfied when she died and became straight on Saint Bon-Chien.

Slight yeast haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"bcXmR6","name":"Brasserie Thiriez","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie Thiriez","website":"http:\/\/www.brasseriethiriez.com\/#!news.html","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9HcWSd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"22 rue Wormhout","locality":"Esquelbecq","phone":"33-03.28.62.88.44","latitude":50.8850949,"longitude":2.4328954,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FR","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"FR","name":"FRANCE","displayName":"France","isoThree":"FRA","numberCode":250,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eCVuUL","name":"L'Amitie","nameDisplay":"L'Amitie","abv":"9.5","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-19 17:17:47","updateDate":"2017-09-19 17:17:47","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"Jt43j7","name":"New Belgium Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"New Belgium","description":"We'll set the scene: 1989.
