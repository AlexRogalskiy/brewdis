These barrels come from different whiskey distilleries such as Bowmore, Tamdhu, Strathspey and Laphroaig (Johnstons). The aroma\u2019s of the whiskeys have an obvious impact on the final flavor. This flavor is remarkable and clearly different from those of previous batches. Peat and burnt are more present, while wood and wood tannins are less obvious to spot. But the warming effect of the full, robust flavor the whiskey barrels passed on to our already beautiful Quadrupel, makes this batch maybe even the most tasty brewed to date.","abv":"10","styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KkwD73\/upload_b6tids-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KkwD73\/upload_b6tids-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KkwD73\/upload_b6tids-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KkwD73\/upload_b6tids-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KkwD73\/upload_b6tids-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KkwD73\/upload_b6tids-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-31 15:20:07","updateDate":"2015-12-17 17:08:14","style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

The most important ingredient of this batch is a red wine from Cahors, department Lot, that has matured well over 2.5 years in barriques of French Malbec. The grapes used for Malbec wines are full of colour and powerful tannins, which make for the distinctive rich taste and dark colour.\r\n\r\nThe first impression of the scent of this Oak Aged is complex and reminiscent of ripe black fruit, vanilla, cacao and tobacco.  \r\n\r\nContrary to Batch 31, for which Malbec wine barrel are used as well, the wood flavour in Batch 34 is enhanced by the relatively large amount of new wood that is used. In combination with the lengthy maturing period, this results in a very high level of wood tannins for an intense Oak Aged experience. \r\n\r\nMaturation has significantly reduced the bitterness, which makes the beer sweeter and softer than the normal Quadrupel.\r\n\r\nThe aftertaste brings out the taste of red wine, giving a pleasant, slightly sour finish.","abv":"11","styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/azm5Du\/upload_Dd8ezc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/azm5Du\/upload_Dd8ezc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/azm5Du\/upload_Dd8ezc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/azm5Du\/upload_Dd8ezc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/azm5Du\/upload_Dd8ezc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/azm5Du\/upload_Dd8ezc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-16 18:46:14","updateDate":"2019-05-16 18:47:10","style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"pzWq1r","name":"Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Jolly Pumpkin","description":"Welcome to a land of open fermentation, oak barrel aging, and bottle conditioning.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"wOiNxq","name":"Labatt Ontario Breweries","nameShortDisplay":"Labatt Ontario Breweries","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FTCwW9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Simcoe Street","locality":"London","region":"Ontario","phone":"1-519-663-5050","latitude":42.9776,"longitude":-81.248,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2017-08-29 13:39:30","timezoneId":"America\/Toronto","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kwXwyf","name":"Labatt Crystal","nameDisplay":"Labatt Crystal","description":"Labatt Crystal was introduced to Ontario in the late 1800s as one of the first lagers brewed by Labatt.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
