The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"oJkeNe","name":"Pigskin Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Pigskin","description":"Pigskin is more than a name, it\u2019s an idea.

It progressed to the inevitable challenge of making our own home brew versions of the shared beers we loved and with the donation of our first brewing equipment from a friend, we started our beer making journey about 18 years ago.  From the beginning, we both found common ground having similar tastes in beer styles which progressed to a shared obsession of trying to figure out how our favorites were made.  We both shared in the fun of sharing our results with friends and watching their reactions, which kept us motivated to make more.  Now, I think we play to each other\u0080\u0099s strengths.  Mike is excited about the technical part of brewing and Greg enjoys determining flavor combinations and fun new things to try.  Our joint passion to make fun, creative craft beer coupled with our individual strengths makes a good brewing team that works well together.","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"mikeo@deviatebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:40:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:21:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WGBS5VOAFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HB7F1d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4004 W. 96th St.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46268","phone":"999-999-9999","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Closed to brew\r\nTuesday - Closed to brew\r\nWednesday - Closed for now\r\nThursday - Closed for now\r\nFriday - 5 pm to 10 pm\r\nSaturday - Noon to 10 pm\r\nSunday - Noon to 6pm","latitude":39.9265355,"longitude":-86.2289472,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","updateDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-5:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Closed to brew\r\nTuesday - Closed to brew\r\nWednesday - Closed for now\r\nThursday - Closed for now\r\nFriday - 5 pm to 10 pm\r\nSaturday - Noon to 10 pm\r\nSunday - Noon to 6pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GNNbEZ","name":"Lactic Zeppelin","nameDisplay":"Lactic Zeppelin","description":"Berliner Weisse with Brettanomyces and Guava & Passionfruit","abv":"3.3","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-08-25 22:58:59","updateDate":"2019-08-25 22:58:59","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"EYuZg3","name":"Cigar City Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Cigar City","description":"Cigar City Brewing, makers of Jai Alai IPA and Hunahpu\u2019s Imperial Stout, was founded in 2007 by Joey Redner with the goal of creating quality beer that reflected the flavors and history of the Tampa region.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

They also serve a rotating selection of other craft brewers beer and Bud Light for those that aren't into it.","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/TwentyNineBrewPub\/about\/?ref=page_internal","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ksF9st\/upload_PNBplv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ksF9st\/upload_PNBplv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ksF9st\/upload_PNBplv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ksF9st\/upload_PNBplv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ksF9st\/upload_PNBplv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-13 01:06:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"3LlL8r","name":"Main Location","region":"Marion","postalCode":"Ohio","latitude":40.5886699,"longitude":-83.1285242,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-05 14:40:20","updateDate":"2017-07-05 14:40:20","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ugpl59","name":"Lade \u00d8l","nameDisplay":"Lade \u00d8l","description":"Toasted Hay Grisette.\r\nBrewed in with our friend Marcell from Community Table.","abv":"4","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-15 11:30:13","updateDate":"2016-08-15 11:30:14","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

We focus our attention on producing well-constructed beers with an eye towards simplicity and character. SARA takes liberty in emulating those memorable beers, their brewers, and the experiences they foster, never forgetting those giants on whose shoulders we stand.\r\n\r\nOur approach to beer making is one of whimsy, highly inspired by the Belgian tradition, but also in harmony with brewers all over the world who push against boundaries of style with a nudge, not a shove. Often our beers are barrel-aged, usually in wine barrels, with various yeast and bacteria. As often as not though, Sante Adairius brews beers more approachable and traditional in nature, yet no less flavorful or distinctive.\r\n\r\nOwned and operated by us, Adair Paterno and Tim Clifford, Sante Adairius Rustic Ales is our attempt to bring people together over great beer. SARA is an expression of our many years of beer geekery, the rabbit hole of tasting every beer we could get our hands on, and trusting we could contribute to the canon of those beers of the highest esteem. We believe great beer comes first. We stay true to our brewing roots. We take seriously the fact that we are brewing for you, and for ourselves. We appreciate your interest in our efforts.
