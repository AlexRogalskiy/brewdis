Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

The brewery began production in January 2014 and won two bronze medals for their coolship ales (Category: Experimental, Subcategory: Wild Ales) at The Great American Beer Festival in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, Black Project expanded production with a small addition to the property which allowed for the expansion of their barrel program. This allowed the brewery to evolve from Former Future Brewing Company to only serving Black Project beers. In 2017, Black Project hopes to produce 250 BBL of beer and increase distribution.\r\n\r\nEvery Black Project beer is fermented with microbes captured from the local environment via a coolship or foraged from nature. We believe this creates a beer that is unrivaled in complexity. Our beers are intended to have a sense of place, or terroir. No matter how hard one tried to, our beer cannot be replicated outside of our brewery. In fact, our microbe cultures are purposefully allowed to evolve from batch to batch, creating variations and interesting twists from different releases of the same beer. \r\n\r\nWe are meticulous about designing recipes and processes that will allow nature to take over and create beers unrivaled in their beauty and complexity. Through experimentation and research, we are continuously developing new and different techniques for use with wild and spontaneous fermentation.\r\n\r\nWe are not and do not have any intention of being a Lambic brewery. We use science and experimentation to find which processes and ingredients we want and often use that in parallel to traditional Lambic producers, however, other than the use of a coolship, we maintain no strict adherence to tradition for tradition's sake. Spontaneous fermentation is merely a starting point and core of our process, from there our research and development extends much beyond the scope of the great Belgian brewers and blenders.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackprojectbeer.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/blackprojectenlist","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-25 18:19:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZIWKX6PJO3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"pfxJGR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1290 South Broadway","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80210","latitude":39.6933944,"longitude":-104.9870534,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-25 18:21:14","updateDate":"2016-10-25 18:21:14","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yT14hA","name":"Jaunty Woodsman","nameDisplay":"Jaunty Woodsman","description":"An American IPA with bold bitterness.

The company purchased an acre and a half of land at 800 44th Avenue North, and went to work on the future of the brewery. Shortly after celebrating 4 years of business, the move from the East side to the West side began. From roughly 5000 square feet, to a brand new, state of the art, 33,000 square foot facility.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MFgb7Y","name":"Javanilla Ten FIDY","nameDisplay":"Javanilla Ten FIDY","abv":"10.5","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-03-09 21:38:56","updateDate":"2017-03-09 21:38:56","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

This seasonal brew is only available for a limited time; perfect for festivals, Halloween parties, and Thanksgiving dinner.\r\nRecommended Foods: Boiled Brisket with Root Veggies, Roast Duck or Turkey, Pumpkin Pie or Sweet Potato Pie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.","abv":"6","ibu":"26","glasswareId":5,"availableId":7,"styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eNoX2K\/upload_v9Xx8m-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eNoX2K\/upload_v9Xx8m-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eNoX2K\/upload_v9Xx8m-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eNoX2K\/upload_v9Xx8m-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eNoX2K\/upload_v9Xx8m-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eNoX2K\/upload_v9Xx8m-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:31","updateDate":"2015-12-16 08:09:14","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

In 2005, 14,000 gallons of beer was produced by the brewery, and with the new additions, the planned output for 2007 is double the 2005 amount.","website":"http:\/\/www.newalbanian.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2019-06-28 19:44:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ALN8FS65ZI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"253IOJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3312 Plaza Drive","locality":"New Albany","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47150","phone":"812-949-2804","website":"http:\/\/www.newalbanian.com\/","latitude":38.32809,"longitude":-85.817146,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ENDJ7o","name":"Bank Street Brewhouse","streetAddress":"415 Bank Street","locality":"New Albany","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47150","phone":"(812) 944-2577","latitude":38.286812,"longitude":-85.8225779,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-22 14:26:43","updateDate":"2015-11-19 19:24:45","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:00am-9:00pm,wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-10:00am-9:00pm,sun-10:00am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"T3Cxyp","name":"Jaxon XPA","nameDisplay":"Jaxon XPA","abv":"5.6","ibu":"52","styleId":74,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-18 10:46:23","updateDate":"2016-11-18 19:33:23","style":{"id":74,"categoryId":6,"category":{"id":6,"name":"International Ale Styles","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Australian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Austrailian Pale","description":"Australian-Style Pale Ales are light amber to light brown.
