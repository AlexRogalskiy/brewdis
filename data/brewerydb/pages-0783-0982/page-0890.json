The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com. Becky worked with Chatham Hill Winery for 2 years learning tasting room and wine club management. We are members of the Chatham County Beekeepers Association, and the NC Winegrowers Association.","website":"http:\/\/starrlightmead.com","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 15:30:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"XPKDbB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"480 Hillsboro Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 1000","locality":"Pittsboro","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27312","phone":"919-533-6314","website":"http:\/\/starrlightmead.com","hoursOfOperation":"Regular Hours\r\nThursdays and Fridays from noon til 6 pm\r\n\r\nSaturdays from noon til 6 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 1 pm, 3 pm & 5 pm.\r\n\r\nSundays from 1 pm til 5 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 2 pm & 4 pm.","latitude":35.7269418,"longitude":-79.1752021,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"meadery","locationTypeDisplay":"Meadery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 15:32:51","updateDate":"2015-07-13 19:07:23","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Regular Hours\r\nThursdays and Fridays from noon til 6 pm\r\n\r\nSaturdays from noon til 6 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 1 pm, 3 pm & 5 pm.\r\n\r\nSundays from 1 pm til 5 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 2 pm & 4 pm.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2yo1Pr","name":"Kickin' Strong Ale","nameDisplay":"Kickin' Strong Ale","abv":"10.6","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-20 15:59:19","updateDate":"2015-09-20 15:59:19","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VaEPTf","name":"Kili Wit","nameDisplay":"Kili Wit","description":"Our Kili Wit is a traditionally brewed white beer with refreshing flavors and creamy smoothness.
