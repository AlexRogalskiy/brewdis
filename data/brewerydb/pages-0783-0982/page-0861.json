Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"hZ5iM1","name":"St Elmo Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"St Elmo","description":"St Elmo, TX was founded in 1875.  It boasted a post office and later a school, which remains today. St Elmo Brewing Company was started in 2016 by two dudes that love beer. They love sharing it, drinking it, and most of all, making it. \r\n\r\nSt Elmo was started by Tim Bullock and Bryan Winslow. We aren\u2019t beer bigots, we like ALL the beer. Every style of beer has it\u2019s special place in life.  St Elmo is our effort to take you to all of those in places, in your mouth. \r\n\r\nWe chose the name St. Elmo for a very important reason. Our location. We are very excited to grow and be a part of The Yard and the St. Elmo neighborhood. With tons of great neighbors like Music Lab, South Austin Brewery, Still Austin, Spokesman, and Juiceland, we hope to bring the heat to an already creative block.  \r\n\r\nAt St Elmo, we\u2019re excited to engage with our neighbors and break down barriers between brewer and drinker. Our brewhouse is open to the bar for a reason. \r\n\r\nOur bar, beer hall, and beer garden are great places to spend your day. We\u2019re open six days a week. And great beer isn\u2019t the only option. We also have pour-over coffee, housemade mineral water, and soda. And food! Our resident food truck, Soursop, serves amazing Asian drinking food: we\u2019re talking fatty pork, thai chicken wings, La Koreanita burger, etc.\r\n\r\nA clean, refreshing Kolsch is hard to beat in the Texas heat.  Pale Ale that explodes with zest and fruit is a fantastic way to relax with friends. We love a funky Saison on a cool spring evening.  What we\u2019re getting at is, we love all the beer!\r\n\r\nCome ask us a question and help us make better beer! Everyday is better with beer.","website":"http:\/\/stelmobrewing.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZ5iM1\/upload_PTMnrM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZ5iM1\/upload_PTMnrM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZ5iM1\/upload_PTMnrM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZ5iM1\/upload_PTMnrM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZ5iM1\/upload_PTMnrM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-05 15:20:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:42:25","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U6EC3QTLSO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Q1XVjK","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"44 E.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"FcVHIq","name":"405 Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"405","description":"(405) Brewing Co. was co-founded by two life-long friends, Trae Carson and Jonathan Stapleton.\r\n\r\nTheir passion for creating memorable experiences through beer has manifested into a project brewery with a philosophy of \"FDR\".\r\n\r\nEach batch and every blend is an exploration into new brewing techniques and processes with an emphasis on mixed fermentation.
