The first brewmaster was Michael Borchers which brought with him experience and used machines from the now defunct Silver Creek Brewing Corporation that was located in Sellersburg, Indiana. Jared Williamson and Jesse Williams are the current brewers working the brewery. In 2005, 14,000 gallons of beer was produced by the brewery, and with the new additions, the planned output for 2007 is double the 2005 amount.","website":"http:\/\/www.newalbanian.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hZLFZg\/upload_PnxAVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2019-06-28 19:44:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ALN8FS65ZI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"253IOJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3312 Plaza Drive","locality":"New Albany","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47150","phone":"812-949-2804","website":"http:\/\/www.newalbanian.com\/","latitude":38.32809,"longitude":-85.817146,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ENDJ7o","name":"Bank Street Brewhouse","streetAddress":"415 Bank Street","locality":"New Albany","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47150","phone":"(812) 944-2577","latitude":38.286812,"longitude":-85.8225779,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-22 14:26:43","updateDate":"2015-11-19 19:24:45","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:00am-9:00pm,wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-10:00am-9:00pm,sun-10:00am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PyQXg1","name":"Houndstooth","nameDisplay":"Houndstooth","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-01 10:55:18","updateDate":"2018-11-06 20:15:20","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
