Our position as Portland's smallest brewery has earned respect within the community, and we appreciate that.

We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"99PaHL","name":"Invicto","nameDisplay":"Invicto","abv":"5.5","ibu":"24","styleId":94,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-30 22:52:15","updateDate":"2017-10-02 17:09:16","style":{"id":94,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Light (Low Calorie) Lager","shortName":"American Light Lager","description":"These beers are extremely light colored, light in body, and high in carbonation.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.
