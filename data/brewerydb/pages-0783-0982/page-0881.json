There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Karl is a real beer, exactly as genuine Estonian beer used to be for centuries before modern times. There is no innovative crystal filtration or luxurious aroma bouquet, no posh hop cultivars or trendy freshness. This beer only includes barley malt, water, hops, yeast and the experience gathered by Saku brew masters over centuries.

It takes a pair. A pair of guys who know how to build a brewery with character. For such a momentous anniversary, we needed to go all out. Our robust Doppelbock started out as a seriously rich, malty lager with deep toffee flavors and a plum-like fruit character.  Kicking it up a notch, we aged it in oak bourbon barrels for an entire year, adding layers of vanilla, toasted oak, and a warm lingering finish. Whether you drink it now or let it age, enjoy a beer with as much soul as the brewery that created it. Cheers to our first 25 years, and the next 25 to come.","abv":"9.5","ibu":"13","glasswareId":6,"srmId":41,"availableId":2,"styleId":90,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2jHaZ\/upload_mOK0au-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2jHaZ\/upload_mOK0au-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2jHaZ\/upload_mOK0au-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2jHaZ\/upload_mOK0au-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2jHaZ\/upload_mOK0au-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2jHaZ\/upload_mOK0au-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cellar","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cellar - (12-14C\/54-57F)","createDate":"2014-07-25 22:56:32","updateDate":"2015-12-17 15:23:23","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":90,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Doppelbock","shortName":"Doppelbock","description":"Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying.

Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels.

Amber","description":"With the first batch of his namesake Amber, Karl shared a beer and a passion that changed brewing in San Diego. Imported Munich malts give our original flagship the deep bronze color and crisp toasted malt flavors of a Vienna-style lager, while Cascade hops and our proprietary yeast strain lend a smooth body and clean finish. Brewed in small batches since 1989, Karl Strauss Amber remains San Diego\u2019s original session beer.\r\n\r\nKarl spent his life making beer. He believed that behind every beer recipe was an inspiration, and behind every pint was a story waiting to be told. Karl Strauss Amber was his story, a story that challenged and inspired a new generation of brewers. Today we brew our own stories, while raising a pint to the man and the beer that started it all.","abv":"4.2","ibu":"16","glasswareId":5,"srmId":15,"availableId":1,"styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzzywG\/upload_2IrdDN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzzywG\/upload_2IrdDN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzzywG\/upload_2IrdDN-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzzywG\/upload_2IrdDN-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzzywG\/upload_2IrdDN-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KzzywG\/upload_2IrdDN-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:41","updateDate":"2015-12-16 06:29:42","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":15,"name":"15","hex":"BB5100"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent malted wheat, and hop rates may be low to medium. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. Chill haze is also acceptable.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:07"},"breweries":[{"id":"mtUjck","name":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Karl Strauss","description":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company has pioneered the San Diego beer scene since 1989 with innovative beer releases like Mosaic Session Ale, Big Barrel IIPA, and Wreck Alley Imperial Stout.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"jwWiTH","name":"Yards Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Yards","description":"In 1988, two cash-strapped collegiate wrestlers realized that they could sustain their thirst for quality beer without spending their modest savings at the local liquor store by brewing beer themselves.
