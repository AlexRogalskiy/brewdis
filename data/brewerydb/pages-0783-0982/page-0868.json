This unique ale consists of Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar aged in Rogue\u2019s Hazelnut Spiced Rum barrels.\r\n\r\nTo craft this exceptional brew, John Couchot first distills Rogue Hazelnut Spiced Rum and ages it in white oak barrels, allowing the barrels to soak up the subtle flavors of Oregon hazelnuts, vanilla and spices from the rum. When the rum is finished aging, the barrels are emptied and John Maier immediately fills them with Hazelnut Brown Nectar. After approximately 6 months of ocean aging, this unique ale is ready.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"34","glasswareId":5,"srmId":4,"availableId":4,"styleId":132,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YVY6WZ\/upload_8i2hR4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YVY6WZ\/upload_8i2hR4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YVY6WZ\/upload_8i2hR4-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YVY6WZ\/upload_8i2hR4-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YVY6WZ\/upload_8i2hR4-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YVY6WZ\/upload_8i2hR4-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:32","updateDate":"2015-12-16 06:39:12","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":132,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

Aged","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"CZ6MCK","name":"Bayou Teche Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Bayou Teche","description":"Bayou Teche Brewing was founded on a simple dream \u2013 to craft beers that compliment the cuisine and lifestyle of Louisiana's Cajuns and Creoles.","website":"http:\/\/bayoutechebrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CZ6MCK\/upload_0f2rWc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CZ6MCK\/upload_0f2rWc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CZ6MCK\/upload_0f2rWc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CZ6MCK\/upload_0f2rWc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CZ6MCK\/upload_0f2rWc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:34:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SYFM1AEKTC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"vqbRV9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1002 Noth Lane","locality":"Arnaudville","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70512","phone":"(337) 303-8000","website":"http:\/\/bayoutechebrewing.blogspot.com\/","latitude":30.3691322,"longitude":-91.9883172,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"aVzDXb","name":"Join Me in Helles","nameDisplay":"Join Me in Helles","description":"Malty sweet aroma, pale in color and ready to take you to Helles!","abv":"5.2","ibu":"18","glasswareId":13,"availableId":4,"styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2017-07-12 21:49:16","updateDate":"2017-07-13 13:29:29","glass":{"id":13,"name":"Willi","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.
