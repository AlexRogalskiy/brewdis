A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.

The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it.

From hopped up American IPAs to Belgian-Style Ales, we're brewing the kind of beer that we love to drink, and we're looking forward to sharing it with everbody who's willing to join us.","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-13 17:12:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:27:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CR4JG12LNA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"VAj3CW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8700 W. 47th St.","locality":"Lyons","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60534","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com\/brewery\/","latitude":41.8060004,"longitude":-87.8370967,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 18:28:06","updateDate":"2015-01-14 20:24:00","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-12:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5wh2hW","name":"KNOWLE SPRING","nameDisplay":"KNOWLE SPRING","description":"Introducing Knowle Spring Blonde, the new member of the Taylor\u2019s family.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-09-03 12:33:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"12HYVPGOJF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Fegley's Allentown Brew Works","streetAddress":"812 W Hamilton St","locality":"Allentown","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18101","phone":"610.433.7777","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com\/allentown-brewworks\/","latitude":40.6013531,"longitude":-75.4739451,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"SAPoSh","name":"Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works","streetAddress":"569 Main Street","locality":"Bethlehem","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18018","phone":"610-882-1300","latitude":40.6222629,"longitude":-75.3821851,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4f08kw","name":"Knucklebones","nameDisplay":"Knucklebones","description":"Hazy IPA with Simcoe, Mosaic, and Hallertau Blanc.","abv":"6.9","ibu":"35","styleId":172,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-29 14:19:35","updateDate":"2018-12-29 14:19:35","style":{"id":172,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Juicy or Hazy India Pale Ale","shortName":"Juicy or Hazy IPA","description":"Color: Straw to deep gold\r\n\r\nClarity: Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers.

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-12-14 21:09:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JS9DRET054","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
