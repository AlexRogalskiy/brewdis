The majority of the hops that we use are grown in Oregon and Washington State, but some of our specialty beers will be brewed with hops from our very own farm in upstate New York.","website":"http:\/\/hellbenderbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CepDrc\/upload_EfsoMh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CepDrc\/upload_EfsoMh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CepDrc\/upload_EfsoMh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CepDrc\/upload_EfsoMh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CepDrc\/upload_EfsoMh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-17 13:42:34","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:10:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Z8FYVJ0CIQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"4jt92U","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5788 2nd Street NE","locality":"Washington","region":"District of Columbia","postalCode":"20011","phone":"(202) 827-8768","website":"http:\/\/hellbenderbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":38.9600338,"longitude":-77.0051746,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-17 13:43:11","updateDate":"2015-03-02 19:52:32","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-5:00pm-8:00pm,fri-5:00pm-8:00pm,sat-1:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LukqqS","name":"KPA (Kenosha Pale Ale)","nameDisplay":"KPA (Kenosha Pale Ale)","description":"Our August Signature Series Seasonal, brewed with Kenosha resident and guest brewer Bob Poisl, is a beautifully balanced American pale ale, hopped with Cascade and Amarillo and dryhopped with a boatload of Amarillo hops for a big citrusy aroma and overall experience.","abv":"5.6","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-17 12:21:19","updateDate":"2015-04-27 18:39:55","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"NtcmVN","name":"Mason Jar Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Mason Jar","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NtcmVN\/upload_PCi607-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NtcmVN\/upload_PCi607-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NtcmVN\/upload_PCi607-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NtcmVN\/upload_PCi607-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NtcmVN\/upload_PCi607-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 19:36:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:30:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Y1OW6K30HS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AtKAY7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29683 New Hub Dr.","extendedAddress":"Suite A","locality":"Menifee","region":"California","postalCode":"92586","latitude":33.6893469,"longitude":-117.1772976,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 19:37:13","updateDate":"2015-10-23 19:37:13","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"h0EAEL","name":"Krash the Kremlin","nameDisplay":"Krash the Kremlin","abv":"12.5","availableId":2,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/h0EAEL\/upload_dvQwMl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/h0EAEL\/upload_dvQwMl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/h0EAEL\/upload_dvQwMl-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/h0EAEL\/upload_dvQwMl-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/h0EAEL\/upload_dvQwMl-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/h0EAEL\/upload_dvQwMl-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-27 11:44:41","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:50:51","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"},"breweries":[{"id":"em9Lxc","name":"Two Roads Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Two Roads","description":"Two Roads isn\u2019t just the logo on our brewery building, it\u2019s our philosophy.
