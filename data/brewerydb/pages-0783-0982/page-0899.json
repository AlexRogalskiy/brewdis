The results were award-winning products with a reputation for craft excellence.\r\n\r\nGREAT BEER FROM WINE COUNTRY\r\nAs one of Temecula\u2019s first craft breweries, Black Market introduced locally brewed beers to the community. Now found far beyond Temecula, Black Market beers are on shelves and in establishments throughout Southern California, Arizona and Washington.\r\n\r\nLEADING A MOVEMENT\r\nLike many craft breweries before us, we have followed stories of those who came before us.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"OQJeOY","name":"Crabtree Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Crabtree","description":"Greeley's First Production Brewery!

Jobs was well and midden side by side. It was, however, aware that it was dangerous to drink the water. The food was smoked and salted. They ate meat, fish and cabbage.\r\n\r\nWhen brewing, the grist is dissolved in hot water. They found out quickly that if you boiled water and added hops to the beer, so we got a drink, you were not sick and could stay.\r\n\r\nEvery Dane drank in the Middle Ages 6-8 liters of beer a day! A common rural households with 15 persons should be provided with 90-120 liters of beer every day! Scullery was more important than the kitchen, and most often, a rural household have a girl who did not do anything other than produce malt and beer.\r\n\r\nOn Monastic can now see the ruins of both kitchen and utility room. Scullery was greater than the kitchen! There was Monastic 4 breweries that were in use at the same time.\r\n\r\nKlosterbryg is brewed with lager malt, wheat malt and caramel malt. It is seasoned with three different types of hops, which matches maltene. This is a beer with 6% alcohol, which is in the style of India Pale Ale.\r\n\r\nThere is only applied aroma hops. English Fuggles and Styrian Goldings with German Perle. Fuggles and Goldings are the two most classic English aroma hops. They give the beer a slightly perfumed scent, reminiscent of clementines.\r\n\r\nAroma hops makes the beer very soft in taste. With a fairly large dosage you do not experience the harsh bitterness that hops else can provide.\r\n\r\nThis is a beer that is suitable for fish and light meat dishes.

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"qlwwem","name":"Spiteful Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Spiteful","description":"We are a Chicago nanobrewery committed to brewing proper beer and delivering it to Chicagoans one case at a time.

Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"},"breweries":[{"id":"dKvrhI","name":"Kl\u00fcver's Brauhaus","nameShortDisplay":"Kl\u00fcver's Brauhaus","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"EPMhfh","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Schlewsig-Holstein","latitude":47.759798,"longitude":10.710171,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:39:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"y4F2OO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Schiffbr\u00fccke 2","locality":"Neustadt in Holstein","region":"Schlewsig-Holstein","postalCode":"D-23730","latitude":54.1057622,"longitude":10.8112775,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:48:19","updateDate":"2017-08-28 15:45:35","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9BOaM1","name":"Kl\u00fcver\u2019s Weizen","nameDisplay":"Kl\u00fcver\u2019s Weizen","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:23:44","updateDate":"2018-11-06 19:59:23","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
