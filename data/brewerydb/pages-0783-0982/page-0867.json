Not this time around.\r\n \r\nA brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man.

Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what \u201cpour to the line\u201d means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin\u2026still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery\u2026 True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.\r\n \r\nSome things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t.

Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, \u201cThe true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.\u201d  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that\u2019s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!  The brewery also strives to honor the working past of Vancouver and Washington state by using locally sourced ingredients in the beer and food that we serve.","website":"http:\/\/dirtyhandsbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 02:20:26","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"UfTXZT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"114 E.

We think that it\u2019s a perfect marriage of coffee, beer, and chocolate.\r\n\r\nThe beer begins as a malty brown ale, comprised of Belgian aroma, caramel malts, and oats. A bit of lactose adds body and some sweetness, and a heaping helping of cocoa nibs in the whirlpool provides further richness, and a deep chocolaty aroma.  Hop aroma is nonexistent, and bitterness is there just to keep the sweetness in check.\r\n\r\nWe worked with our great friends at Stagecoach Coffee in Cooperstown to come up with a custom coffee blend that complimented our base beer. Sumatra, Papua New Guinea, and French roast form a combination with chocolate, earth, spice, fruit, and light roast characteristics. Following primary fermentation the beer is cold crashed and yeast is removed. Coffee is added to a secondary tank and the beer is circulated through the freshly roasted beans to extract even more flavor and aroma.\r\n\r\nThe result is really something special: aromas of cold brewed coffee, milk chocolate and rich malt \u2013 the taste follows, round, smooth and creamy, with a touch of sweetness.","abv":"7.5","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PalBfG\/upload_Lvj72g-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PalBfG\/upload_Lvj72g-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PalBfG\/upload_Lvj72g-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PalBfG\/upload_Lvj72g-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PalBfG\/upload_Lvj72g-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PalBfG\/upload_Lvj72g-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2016-04-04 15:24:18","updateDate":"2016-04-04 15:25:11","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"Sldiyh","name":"Augusta Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Augusta","description":"The Augusta Brewing Company & Beer Garden is located on the KATY Trail in Augusta, Missouri.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"X0l98q","name":"Rogue Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Rogue Ales","description":"Rogue Ales & Spirits is an agri-fermenter founded in Oregon in 1988 as one of America\u2019s first microbreweries.
