There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"X0l98q","name":"Rogue Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Rogue Ales","description":"Rogue Ales & Spirits is an agri-fermenter founded in Oregon in 1988 as one of America\u2019s first microbreweries.

We opened in June of 2015, making us the second oldest brewery in Athens!\r\n\r\n Like many of today's best microbreweries, the origins of Devil's Kettle go back to a kitchen stovetop, with some pots and buckets. Brewmaster Cameron Fuller grew up around winemaking, but when he reached college, his interests shifted towards beer. Unlike most undergrads, Fuller had a passion for craft beers, but affordability was an issue for a college student. He decided to teach himself how to make his own beer with just the help of the internet and some of his family's old winemaking equipment. Not surprisingly, the early beers were less than desirable, but a fire was lit.\r\n\r\n For the next 8 years, Fuller focused on perfecting his craft. The beers got better and the reviews were great, but how true is the praise from people who are given free beer? In 2013, Fuller entered a number of his beers in the Ohio Brew Week homebrew competition to get some unbiased feedback, with the mindset that if he did \"well enough\", then he would consider going pro. Well, \"good enough\" was never in question. He won the most medals in the competition and Best in Show. Not only was the path to professional brewing before him, he was practically being pushed down it.\r\n\r\n\u200bThe next 2 years comprised of financing, finding a location, and developing it to become a brewery. A lot of hard work paid off and we were able to open with a world class brew system, a gorgeous taproom, and an eviable amount of space to grow and improve our operations. We couldn't be happier with what we have and we can't wait to share it with you!\r\n\r\n\u200b","website":"https:\/\/www.devilskettlebrew.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-26 23:44:50","updateDate":"2019-07-03 20:12:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7P8N5RWYS3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"M1gpEp","name":"Devil's Kettle Brewing","streetAddress":"97 Columbus Rd","locality":"Athens","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45701","phone":"(740) 589-7187","latitude":39.3492074,"longitude":-82.0954267,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-26 23:49:06","updateDate":"2015-06-26 23:49:06","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5zXBqY","name":"JustIn Time Stout","nameDisplay":"JustIn Time Stout","description":"A Irish style stout brewed with cacao nibs and oatmeal.

Here in Brooklyn, we based our distinctly American take on Kriek on our dark abbey ale, the estimable Local 2. To this beer\u2019s subtle marriage of malts, dark candi sugar, local wildflower honey and zing of orange peel, we added tart dried whole Montmorency cherries from Michigan. Around this, we wrapped a barrel of charred American bourbon oak. The sugar of the cherries began to ferment away. The barrels hissed. And we waited.\r\nSix months later, the beer emerged with a glowing red color, vibrant acidity, complex fruit aromatics, and a foundation of oak flavors, its strength moving past 10%. Its transformation almost complete, the beer joined priming sugar, Champagne yeast and wild Brettanomyces yeasts in the bottle and underwent a third fermentation. And we waited yet again.\r\nNow, a full year after we brewed it, this beer is ready for your table. K is for Kriek is dry, fruity, tart, full-bodied, and expansive, able to be enjoyed now or after years of cellaring. This beer is wondrous with poultry, duck and pork dishes, tremendous with goat cheeses, and a fine pairing for desserts.

Just great hand-crafted beer brewed in West London with the best ingredients, knowledge, and respect for process, and a little insanity.\r\n\r\nBut why stop there? We don\u2019t believe in being stereotyped. We love upfront in-your-face hop focused beers, but are we only going to brew these? Hell no! We love beer, and we will brew whatever we want, whenever it suits us.\r\n\r\nAt Weird Beard we aim to continue making experimental, no-holds-barred beers that we feel excited about and we want to drink.\r\n\r\nInspired by the American and burgeoning British craft beer movement, along with great music, exquisite food, epic beards, and the outstanding beer community in our hometown of London, Weird Beard Brew Co will not compromise on anything to bring the best flavours to the beer, whether it is the roasted specialty grains in a stout or the newest hops in an IPA. We create beers that push the boundaries of style, forcing the consumer to stop and think about the drink in front of them, to confront the misconceptions of what ale and beer should or can be, and who drinks it? \r\n\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, Gregg and Bryan do sport some very impressive facial hair. Here at Weird Beard Brew Co we are all about the beards, but not so much the sandals. We are passionate about good beer, no matter where it comes from or how it is dispensed. You will find us in bottle shops, on cask in real ale pubs and in the best London beer bars on keg.\r\n\r\nWeird Beard Brew Co is a full on, no compromise brewery, brewing great tasting and genre-busting beers...hold on to your taste buds and come along for the ride!","website":"http:\/\/www.weirdbeardbrewco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 17:37:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"p0vg5z","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Boston Business Park","extendedAddress":"Unit 5","locality":"Hanwell","region":"London","postalCode":"W72QA","phone":"0203 645 2711","latitude":51.5000484,"longitude":-0.338234,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 17:59:01","updateDate":"2014-11-10 17:59:01","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"iUpRSF","name":"K-9","nameDisplay":"K-9","description":"K-9 Cruiser is a dark, sweet and malty winter warmer that will captivate any adventurous craft brew drinker.

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

This new system will help us meet the growing demand in our state.","website":"http:\/\/dragonmead.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:19:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6RY4IFN1EX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"OyQarF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"14600 East Eleven Mile Road","locality":"Warren","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48089","phone":"586-776-9428","website":"http:\/\/dragonmead.com\/","latitude":42.493159,"longitude":-82.9741767,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Rni1xM","name":"K2's Ale Mary APA","nameDisplay":"K2's Ale Mary APA","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-13 15:17:23","updateDate":"2015-03-13 15:17:24","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"6DUHNk","name":"Wildrose Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wildrose","description":"Four region dudes and a chick dedicated to making the best brews possible!","website":"http:\/\/www.wildrosebrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6DUHNk\/upload_HEv0sC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6DUHNk\/upload_HEv0sC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6DUHNk\/upload_HEv0sC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6DUHNk\/upload_HEv0sC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6DUHNk\/upload_HEv0sC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-13 00:15:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:07:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4FEYMHVXND","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ZIRzuC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1104 East Main St","locality":"Griffith","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46319","latitude":41.5226862,"longitude":-87.4152999,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-13 00:15:05","updateDate":"2015-11-19 20:06:52","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
