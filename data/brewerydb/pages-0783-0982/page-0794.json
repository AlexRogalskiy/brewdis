We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety.

We welcome you as our guests to stop by and try a glass of Peter's hard work.","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8gAMPa","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"500 Commercial Street","locality":"Manchester","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03101","phone":"603-625-4444","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","latitude":42.9940979,"longitude":-71.4672608,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2016-12-08 13:40:06","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DMEV70","name":"Hopzilla","nameDisplay":"Hopzilla","description":"Monstrous quantities of hops; Chinook, Willamette, Amarillo and Kent Goldings transform this Northwest style IPA into a beast of a beer","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:26","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:35","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

It was a dream inspired by a trip to Alaska and a love for the outdoors, and one day, darn it, they were going to make it happen.\r\n\r\nThe couple moved to Tahoe, where Todd put his culinary degree to work as a sous chef while they skied. It was here that they decided it was time to become self-sufficient. Todd had every intention of making their own soap, toothpaste, even toilet paper. But one thing haunted him\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to live without beer. He had no choice; the first step was to learn how to make his own. And that was also the last step.\r\n\r\nTodd\u2019s natural knack for home brewing, made with borrowed equipment, quickly trumped the couple\u2019s off-the-grid dreams. And let\u2019s just say that Lisa wasn\u2019t all that disappointed\u2026now she didn\u2019t have to use the homemade toilet paper for starters, but she also got to drink some damn good beer. Todd and Lisa had never tasted such fine brew, and they knew they were on to something special.\r\n\r\nThat was just the beginning of the journey towards BBC beer. The rest goes something like this\u2026\r\n\r\nTodd refined his beer making skills for a brewery in Calistoga, while working another job and taking classes on the art and science of beer fermentation at UC Davis. But all the while, Montana beckoned.\r\n\r\nTodd scored a job as the head brewer for Spanish Peaks in Bozeman\u2015a position he held for 10 years\u2015and Lisa worked for the City. When Spanish Peaks moved production to California, Todd and Lisa knew it was time to bring their own fine brews to the beer drinkers of Bozeman. They bought the equipment and opened the doors to the Bozeman Brewing Company warehouse in 2001, on the edge of Bozeman\u2019s historic Brewery District on the north side.\r\n\r\nThere, Bozeman Brewing\u2019s flagship beer, Bozone Amber Ale (based on a recipe that Todd had perfected over the years), made its way to the beer drinkers of Montana and beyond. Today, the same warehouse rotates more than 6 seasonal ales and lagers, along with the regulars Hopzone IPA, Gallatin Pale, Plum Street Porter and Two O'clock Wheat.","website":"http:\/\/www.bozemanbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:04:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"R8YCXEGB3D","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"FNU4qr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"504 North Broadway Avenue","locality":"Bozeman","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59715","phone":"406-585-9142","website":"http:\/\/www.bozemanbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat -Thur 2pm to 8pm\r\nFriday noon-8pm","latitude":45.685188,"longitude":-111.0238569,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2016-08-10 15:11:58","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sat -Thur 2pm to 8pm\r\nFriday noon-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"M0sMW0","name":"HORALs Oude Geuze Mega Blend","nameDisplay":"HORALs Oude Geuze Mega Blend","description":"The Mega Blend Geuze is a blend of young and old Lambic from eight HORAL members (3 Fonteinen, Boon, De Cam, De Troch, Hanssens, Lindemans, Oud Beersel and Timmermans).

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"dpDnov","name":"Cogstone Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Cogstone","description":"Cogstones are an ancient artifact from the American Southwest.

With over 85 breweries in San Diego in January of 2013, we knew that we wanted to add our own unique contribution to the beer scene. Having been raised on both sides of the border, we always enjoyed eating from both cultures.  Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.  Our best example of this is our Blood Saison, an agave and Hibiscus infused Saison that come off sweet initially, middle tartness and finishing like a beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@borderxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:08:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OPB6VTC7RN","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"IDHs4u","name":"Logan Tasting Room","streetAddress":"2181 Logan Ave","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92113","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":32.6981181,"longitude":-117.1397986,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2017-06-28 14:43:12","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cRLX8x","name":"Otay Brewery","streetAddress":"8684 Avenida De La Fuente Ste 8","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92154","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","latitude":32.5566393,"longitude":-116.9567988,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-02-18 16:21:01","updateDate":"2017-06-28 14:42:41","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
