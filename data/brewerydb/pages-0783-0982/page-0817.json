Belgium. Boy on bike. (OK, make that a young man of 32). As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2019-07-22 17:20:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SZ1UAXE94G","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"eOm6Xk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"500 Linden Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"1-970-221-0524","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","latitude":40.593415,"longitude":-105.066874,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:48:39","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"m1a0ra","name":"Asheville","streetAddress":"155 Craven Street","locality":"Asheville","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28806","latitude":35.588358,"longitude":-82.573548,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-06 12:29:33","updateDate":"2016-05-09 20:38:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1Z0bj3","name":"Imperial Cherry Gose","nameDisplay":"Imperial Cherry Gose","description":"New York State ranks 4th for tart cherry production in the US, with the majority of the acreage located in four Western New York Counties located about 2 hours from our brewery. We source our tart cherry juice from a grower in Niagara County on the shores of Lake Ontario where the glaciated soils and lake-tempered northern climate are ideal for growing tart cherries. Tart cherries are known as a \u201csuper food\u201d and their price reflects this moniker. They have one of the highest levels of antioxidants of any food, a truly brilliant red color, and a clean, bright, juicy aroma and flavor that\u2019s accentuated by their natural acidity.\r\n\r\nWe maintain a culture of Lactobacillus buchneri that is used to sour wort over three days, starting at a pH of 5.5 and finishing around 3.4. After souring is complete, the wort is boiled, hopped, spiced, cooled, and pitched with our house ale strain of yeast. After roughly 24 hours of fermentation, the tart cherry concentrate is added directly to the fermentation vessel. Exactly when the cherry juice is added is a delicate balancing act of adding the juice (more sugar) early enough so that the fermentation will complete, but late enough that the delicate flavors, aromas, and colors of the juice are preserved as much as possible. It would be a travesty to add such beautiful and rare juice to hot wort, don\u2019t you think?\r\n\r\nThe finished beer is a striking, lustful shade of red with a persistent white head and durable lacing thanks to the large portion of wheat in the grist. The nose is defined by equal parts bright lactic acidity and cherry notes with a hint of coriander. On the palate, the strong lactic acidity is accentuated by the natural tartness of the cherry juice. Quantitatively, this beer is quite sweet, but we find that this level of residual sweetness is just enough to balance the acidity and that the overall perception of the beer is actually quite dry. The beer finishes very clean and in conjunction with the salt in the finish, it definitely makes you want to come back for more.","abv":"8.3","ibu":"7","glasswareId":8,"styleId":165,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Sausages, soft pretzels, grilled fare and just about everything under the sun","createDate":"2016-07-17 15:03:20","updateDate":"2016-07-17 15:03:20","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":165,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Contemporary Gose","shortName":"Contemporary Gose","description":"Contemporary Goses are straw to medium amber, or, may take on the hue of added fruits or other ingredients if present.

Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Also referred to as a winter warmer, this beer balances dark fruit flavors against a background chocolate malt and a slightly sweet finish. It is meant to provide depth of flavor while having a surprisingly clean finish. The effect should be warming, due to the high alcohol, though never losing its balanced drinkability. A great pairing with a variety of foods ranging from roasted meats to caramel desert dishes.\r\n\r\nImperial City Olde Ale takes its name from a piece of Birmingham Alabama\u2019s brewing past. Imperial City Brewing Co. was started in 1911 and was in a race to be the largest brewery in the county. Unfortunately the state of Alabama prohibited alcohol in 1915 and the brewery ended before it even began. Imperial City Olde Ale celebrates the rich brewing history of Birmingham, AL \u2013 both past, present, and future. Remembering Imperial City Brewing Co. reminds us of the trimtab potential legislation has on an industry that brings happiness and culture to millions of people. So, on the 100th anniversary of the prohibition of beer in Alabama, raise a glass and celebrate our brewing brothers and sisters that came before us, and celebrate the bright future that lies ahead!","abv":"7.3","ibu":"55","srmId":20,"availableId":4,"styleId":13,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-24 14:31:20","updateDate":"2015-03-24 14:31:20","srm":{"id":20,"name":"20","hex":"9B3200"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":13,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Old Ale","shortName":"Old Ale","description":"Dark amber to brown in color, old ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness.

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

Look no further than the words of a genius published in a 1972 Playboy.....\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]\u2014 the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go. So I said, call me Trim Tab.\u201d \r\n\u2013 Buckminster Fuller (Playboy, February 1972)\r\n\r\nSmall actions - Huge positive impact.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.
