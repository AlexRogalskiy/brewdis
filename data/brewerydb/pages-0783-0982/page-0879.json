Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:51:48","updateDate":"2019-05-22 20:29:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PJH5R2IXQV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qUIYuC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1710 N Mill St","locality":"Jackson","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39202","phone":"(601) 201-0988","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com","latitude":32.3196024,"longitude":-90.1883188,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:52:56","updateDate":"2019-05-22 20:29:21","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-7:00pm,sat-4:00pm-7:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RtA4iN","name":"Kakeru","nameDisplay":"Kakeru","description":"A kettle sour dry hopped with Equinox hops which feature citrus tropical fruit, and floral aromas.","abv":"5.4","ibu":"21","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-03-31 13:31:05","updateDate":"2017-03-31 13:31:05","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"noGtDY","name":"Bell's Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Bell's","description":"Bell's Brewery began in 1985 with a quest for better beer and a 15 gallon soup kettle.

At the end of the day, here in the brewery, it is all about our microscopic wild friends.","website":"http:\/\/www.artifactbeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 19:28:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:20:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PHUCQ9DFMY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hSB1eG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1660 Blue Rock St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45223","latitude":39.1604192,"longitude":-84.5423262,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-26 17:29:26","updateDate":"2015-05-26 17:31:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"1:30am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"1:30am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-12:00am,tue-4:00pm-12:00am,wed-4:00pm-12:00am,thu-4:00pm-12:00am,fri-4:00pm-1:30am,sat-12:00pm-1:30am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","tourInfo":"The brewers will be giving free tours through the brewery every Saturday and Sunday at 1:00pm and 3:00pm each day.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.
