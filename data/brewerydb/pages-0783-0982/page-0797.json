Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!\r\n\r\nEngine 15 \u2013 Eat, Drink, Brew!","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:01:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TABYSFRXM4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"E6WUse","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1500 Beach Blvd","locality":"Jacksonville Beach","region":"Florida","postalCode":"32250","phone":"904-249-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":30.287586,"longitude":-81.4081999,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"i6cRcw","name":"Hot For Teacher","nameDisplay":"Hot For Teacher","description":"Slightly ever so sweet, mild with good malt flavors with a hint of molasses.","abv":"8.6","ibu":"21","styleId":90,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-01-07 20:12:35","updateDate":"2019-01-07 20:12:35","style":{"id":90,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Doppelbock","shortName":"Doppelbock","description":"Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"},"breweries":[{"id":"PGn0ta","name":"Bruery Terreux","nameShortDisplay":"Bruery Terreux","description":"Wildly Traditional Bi\u00e8re.\r\n\r\nThe Bruery is excited to announce the formation of Bruery Terreux, a new brand that will focus solely on farmhouse-style ales fermented with wild yeasts as well as oak-aged sour ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.brueryterreux.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PGn0ta\/upload_JS1Qmz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-10 22:14:17","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"nGOCHu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"717 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-829-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.brueryterreux.com","latitude":33.8623421,"longitude":-117.879254,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-11 20:06:23","updateDate":"2015-08-31 16:40:16","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
