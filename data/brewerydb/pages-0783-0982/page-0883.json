Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"6zCLiu","name":"Persimmon Hollow Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Persimmon Hollow","description":"Persimmon Hollow Brewing Company is the dream of two great friends and award-winning home brewers who are ready to turn a hobby and passion into a career by turning a former parking garage into a brewery and tap room.

These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"sCgeAO","name":"Torn Label Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Torn Label","website":"http:\/\/www.tornlabel.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-26 01:00:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:20:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LVUIGY87ED","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"BvUnbO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1708 Campbell St.","locality":"Kansas City","region":"Missouri","phone":"(913) 634-8001","latitude":39.0926304,"longitude":-94.5732837,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-26 01:00:59","updateDate":"2017-08-23 03:11:29","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Pz3RDK","name":"KC Weiss","nameDisplay":"KC Weiss","description":"This is our take on Berliner Weiss and since we\u2019re in KC then its KC Weiss.

The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"CBxMJV","name":"Resignation Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Resignation","description":"If you show up to theCHIVE office for a tour, the first thing that happens is you'll be led to theCHIVE's famous beer fridge.
