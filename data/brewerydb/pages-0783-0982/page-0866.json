Hence the \u201cblueprint\u201d for great beer was born! Eric\u2019s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.\r\n\r\nBetter than a recipe, a brewing \u201cblueprint\u201d combines science and great culinary skill to create a Br\u00fceprint.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery\u2014Br\u00fceprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Br\u00fceprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer. Our hope is that you\u2019ll rest your phone for a few minutes to have a real conversation, partake in or watch a game with friends, or take in a great band. Whatever your idea of connecting is, plan for a great time\u2014grab a Br\u00fceprint!","website":"http:\/\/brueprint.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sUoofg\/upload_ZMnXA7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sUoofg\/upload_ZMnXA7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sUoofg\/upload_ZMnXA7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sUoofg\/upload_ZMnXA7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sUoofg\/upload_ZMnXA7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-17 15:03:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:44:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U4NLZO1Y39","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CWwxeR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1229 Perry Road","locality":"Apex","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27502","website":"http:\/\/brueprint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday - Saturday   4 - 10 PM","latitude":35.7121944,"longitude":-78.851764,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-17 15:03:42","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wednesday - Saturday   4 - 10 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vf5r6j","name":"Jingle Fever","nameDisplay":"Jingle Fever","abv":"8","ibu":"35","availableId":4,"styleId":104,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-27 15:31:04","updateDate":"2015-04-27 15:31:04","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":104,"categoryId":9,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Other Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Baltic-Style Porter","shortName":"Baltic Porter","description":"A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"2iPJla","name":"Tatamagouche Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Tatamagouche","description":"We're a family owned and operated Microbrewery located in the heart of Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Each of our beers is associated with the dogs from the kennel as a tribute to the loyalty and companionship that defined each of them.\r\n\r\nWhile not in our original plans, Black Husky began getting calls from bars and restaurants in Milwaukee to see if they could purchase our beers. So we began driving down kegs and bottles to Milwaukee in our Ford Transit Connect van. First two or three kegs and cases and eventually we were turning business away so the poor van didn\u2019t collapse under the load.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Black Husky moved its brewery operations to the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee where we operate a taproom and produce our beers. Not much has changed. Sure there is a bigger building and a few more people in the team but the beer is still delivered in our van, and the same care and dedication to produce the best beer is still practiced to honor the 23 dogs that spent their lives with us.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhuskybrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2019-09-21 11:38:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DJS4M3UBIZ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"lnGqhM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"909 E Locust","locality":"Milwaukee","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53212","phone":"715-324-5152","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhuskybrewing.com\/","latitude":43.0710218,"longitude":-87.9002127,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2017-10-31 17:33:41","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"t6guPb","name":"Joe","nameDisplay":"Joe","abv":"7","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-09 17:17:13","updateDate":"2015-07-09 17:17:13","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
