Adam added more high protein malts in this beer which create it\u2019s distinctively soft, smooth body and also contributes to the beer\u2019s cloudiness. He finished it off by adding 84lbs of fresh blueberries which give this juicy IPA it\u2019s distinctive color. If you liked our Peachy Keen Hazy, you\u2019ll dig this.
