Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"9","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.5","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"17","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:41"}},{"id":"87DfXS","name":"Rampart","nameDisplay":"Rampart","description":"Our version follows the German template with the addition of Munich Malt and Hallertauer Mittelfruh hops, the most noble of the so-called \u201cNoble hops\u201d, but gets an American touch with the addition of California rice.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"27","styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/87DfXS\/upload_g3FKf2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/87DfXS\/upload_g3FKf2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/87DfXS\/upload_g3FKf2-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/87DfXS\/upload_g3FKf2-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/87DfXS\/upload_g3FKf2-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/87DfXS\/upload_g3FKf2-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-28 19:42:02","updateDate":"2018-12-28 19:46:28","style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.
