Three different dark roasted malts provide intense roasty flavors of dark chocolate, espresso and licorice. A heavy dose of hops gives enough bitterness to balance the malts. Rich, thick and mouth-coating, this beer is perfect for sipping and contemplating.\r\n\r\nRussian Imperial Stout gets its name from British brewing tradition. Historically, very strong, dark beers were brewed in England to be shipped to the Baltic region. The Russian Monarchy loved these beers so much that the beers began being referred to as Russian Stouts. Our Russian Imperial Stout is brewed with a unique method that compounds each subsequent batch with wort from the previous. The result is a truly rich, complex beer. This is the base that we age in Bourbon Barrels to eventually become Pugachev\u2019s Cobra.","abv":"12.5","ibu":"85","glasswareId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Flourless Chocolate Cake, Raspberry Tarts, Blue Cheese","createDate":"2013-05-09 17:53:28","updateDate":"2015-04-23 19:03:03","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.
