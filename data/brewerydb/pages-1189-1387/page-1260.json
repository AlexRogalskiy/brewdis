Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"}},{"id":"qAhkSA","name":"Preservation Series: Tripel Tonnellerie","nameDisplay":"Preservation Series: Tripel Tonnellerie (2014)","description":"Tripel Tonnellerie is a 100% barrel fermented version of a Belgian Abbey Tripel. The base beer carries a classically clean maltiness, balanced by a fruity aroma and a dry, spicy mouthfeel. Extended fermentation in oak barrels inoculated with wild yeast allowed the beer to develop the rustic, earthy tones of a classic countryside biere de garde resulting in a uniquely flavorful beer, suitable for beer and wine lovers alike.","abv":"9.5","availableId":2,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2014,"labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qAhkSA\/upload_2vg2Oi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qAhkSA\/upload_2vg2Oi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qAhkSA\/upload_2vg2Oi-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qAhkSA\/upload_2vg2Oi-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qAhkSA\/upload_2vg2Oi-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qAhkSA\/upload_2vg2Oi-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-22 15:44:51","updateDate":"2015-12-17 13:22:08","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"}}],"status":"success"}
