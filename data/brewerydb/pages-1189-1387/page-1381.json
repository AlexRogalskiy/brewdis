Keeping that in mind Upstream's brewers bring you the Saison du Crue, literally season of high water, to mark the passing of this historic summer. This beer presents a pleasant sweet malt body with a hint of rye, balanced by moderate hopping and grains of paradise for a perfect summer quencher.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"30","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:08","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:33","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
