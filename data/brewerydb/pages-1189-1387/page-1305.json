While the Earl is best known for combining meat and bread, Kent thankfully went another direction and created a unique amber ale.\r\n\r\nTrue to his name, Kent took a Belgian Abbey Single, upped the ABV and added some rye malt to create an amber ale unlike any that came before it. As you take a sip, the Belgian yeast and rye malt dance on your tongue. The sweetness of the Belgian yeast hits first, but is quickly balanced against the forward flavors of the rye malt. As you swallow, you are left with a clean palate, ready to experience it all over again.","abv":"5","ibu":"13","availableId":1,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vc0Ak2\/upload_Mwn749-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vc0Ak2\/upload_Mwn749-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vc0Ak2\/upload_Mwn749-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vc0Ak2\/upload_Mwn749-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vc0Ak2\/upload_Mwn749-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vc0Ak2\/upload_Mwn749-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-24 20:30:47","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:04:10","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
