These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

Flavor starts with hops, followed by a gentle malt sweetness, yeast fruitiness and tartness, with a crisp, clean finish.  Bitterness is gentle and not harsh.  Balance is neutral.\r\n \r\nThis beer is different from other domestic saisons because it is less hoppy and does not use the Dupont yeast strain or a similar strain.  Our Belgian yeast strain produces fruity and spicy notes along with some tartness and is a strong attenuator.  Saison is a very diverse style and we wanted a beer that was refreshing but still had a complex flavor profile.  Malt, unmalted wheat, hops, and yeast all make a noticeable contribution to this beer.  The flaked wheat also gives this beer some body since it has a low finishing gravity.  Hops are used in moderate amounts to provide good hop flavor and aroma without overwhelming bitterness or harshness.","abv":"6","ibu":"20","styleId":61,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 16:18:03","updateDate":"2015-05-04 19:27:36","style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
