Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"}},{"id":"jzYXm8","name":"Reissdorf Kolsch","nameDisplay":"Reissdorf Kolsch","abv":"4.8","styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-04 16:47:11","updateDate":"2016-01-04 16:47:11","style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).

Malt flavor and aroma are medium. This is a light-medium to medium-bodied beer. Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze. Competition organizers may wish to subcategorize this style into rice and corn subcategories.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:40:08"}},{"id":"zd06tm","name":"Rembrandt","nameDisplay":"Rembrandt","abv":"5","styleId":19,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-15 01:21:53","updateDate":"2017-09-15 14:22:58","style":{"id":19,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Robust Porter","shortName":"Robust Porter","description":"Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor. These porters have a sharp bitterness of black malt without a highly burnt\/charcoal flavor. Caramel and other malt sweetness should be present and in harmony with other distinguishing porter characters. Robust porters range from medium to full in body and have a malty sweetness. Hop bitterness is medium to high, with hop aroma and flavor ranging from negligible to medium. Diacetyl is acceptable at very low levels. Fruity esters should be evident, balanced with roast malt and hop bitterness.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"6.5","srmMin":"30","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:45"}},{"id":"YzWeMh","name":"Remedy","nameDisplay":"Remedy","abv":"6.7","styleId":149,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-03-24 20:24:49","updateDate":"2017-03-24 20:24:49","style":{"id":149,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Common Cider","shortName":"Common Cider","description":"Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.
