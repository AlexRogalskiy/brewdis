Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

They included grain and yeast. We borrowed some grain from Third Street Aleworks, some more from Bear Republic , and Brian at Moonlight Brewing was kind enough to lend us a couple of kegs to put it in.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what is the Rat Bastard Pale Ale? Jay Brooks of the (Brookston Beer Bulletin) said \"The Rat Bastard is a well-made pale ale, with good aromas and a crisp, clean palate. It has a generous hop bite that finishes bitter, then drops off sharply in the end.\"\r\nThe Rat is a very chuggable drop. Coming in at just under 6%, it's a fine session beer with a clean dry finish.

This beer is a tribute to the beer perhaps most precious ingredient, and it is a tribute to all the 'hopheads' who knows how to enjoy it. Again we have gone berserk and emptied hop room at the brewery. Amager Rated XX 2009 contains a unique composition of no less than 23 hops: Centennial, Hallertau Mittelfr\u00fch, Brewers Gold, Crystal, Simcoe, Pearl, Mt. Hood, Hersbrucker, Challenger, Fuggles, Liberty, Styrian Goldings, Columbus, Chinook, Amarillo, Bramling Cross, East Kent Goldings, Willamette, Palisade, Saaz, First Gold, Pacific Gem and Northern Brewer. Yep, we admit it outright, it's a hop-orgy that will separate the wheat from the chaff among beer lovers - even among those who have believed that their taste buds could easily cope with a violent Double IPA. When it comes to bitterness, then we have given up trying to figure it out, because it is quite impossible. But we're pretty sure that Amager Rated XX 2009, one of the world's most bitter beer.
