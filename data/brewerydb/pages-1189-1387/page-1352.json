Self-proclaimed professional tasters have described wines as \u201cpeppery\u201d for eons. Yet it wasn\u2019t until 2008 when scientists finally identified rotundone as the chemical compound found in both peppercorns and certain grape skins. Even more confounding: 1 in 5 people can\u2019t smell the compound, and the rest of us are super sensitive to it. Every person is unique, and with a beer this complex, everyone will taste something a little different. So when that stuffy, self-important \u201cexpert\u201d tells you what you \u201cshould be\u201d tasting \u2026 just slap him in the face and take another sip. It\u2019ll change again as it cools and warms, and then again as it ages unpredictably.","abv":"8.2","ibu":"30","availableId":2,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/p4D2cV\/upload_HCPqoM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/p4D2cV\/upload_HCPqoM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/p4D2cV\/upload_HCPqoM-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/p4D2cV\/upload_HCPqoM-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/p4D2cV\/upload_HCPqoM-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/p4D2cV\/upload_HCPqoM-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-21 16:23:51","updateDate":"2015-12-18 04:29:06","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
