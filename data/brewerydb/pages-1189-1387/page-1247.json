The beer contains malted barley blended with flaked maize (corn) to produce a deliciously distinct flavor. It may be light in body and color, but it has a full flavor that gives way to a refreshing crispness. Handfuls of hops provide pleasant aromas and a wonderful dry finish.\r\n \r\nPontius Road Pilsner was designed to be like a colonial Pilsner. In colonial times, ingredients were often rationed so people used corn to supplement some of the barley in their beer recipes. Their Pilsners were also slightly hopped to add preservation. The name, Pontius Road Pilsner, derives from the road name that The Woodmaster, Bill Sohn, lives on. Bill encouraged Joe Short to move forward with his brewery business plan, and is a big reason why Short\u2019s exists today!","abv":"5.2","ibu":"18","glasswareId":4,"availableId":2,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TYI58f\/upload_rqvwDm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TYI58f\/upload_rqvwDm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TYI58f\/upload_rqvwDm-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TYI58f\/upload_rqvwDm-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TYI58f\/upload_rqvwDm-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TYI58f\/upload_rqvwDm-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:59","updateDate":"2015-12-16 13:21:15","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
