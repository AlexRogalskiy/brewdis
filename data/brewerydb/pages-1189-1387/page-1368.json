The brewing team, aside from Brewmaster Jon Carpenter, came together to create a beer that they wanted to drink this season. At 6.5% ABV with around 20% rye addition, this beer brings the perfect balance of rye on the nose, a touch of Northwest hops, and a clean, dry finish. When asked what to call the beer, Brewer Cole proudly stated, \"What do you mean? Call it what it is - rye on the pallet.\" We took the meaning a couple ways.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-22 19:30:30","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:50","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Pales are a fairly quick beer to brew- many examples are ready in a couple of weeks- and appeal mainly in that they are quite often balanced beers without too many distractions and without too fine a point on it- they taste like beer!  Our Pale Ale is loaded with Rye malt (about 20%) which adds some viscosity, richness, and a slightly spicy finish.  We use a fair bit of caramel malt for color and our American hop charge has a slight bite and piney finish.  All this said, I think our Pale shares a few finer points with its sister style - Amber.  Our 'Pale' is pretty dark and has a pronounced richness from caramel malt.","styleId":117,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-05 13:24:05","updateDate":"2012-11-05 13:24:05","style":{"id":117,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Rye Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Rye Ale","description":"Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Tradition says that Saisons would be brewed on working farms in Belgium and France to sustain the workers during the summer months of heat and labor.  Our take on this style includes brewing with a portion of rye grain to add some delightfully tart spiciness to the mix.  This beer is very dry with an almost Champagne like effervescence.  The real star here is the yeast.  A special Belgian yeast provides a bounty of tropical fruit, spice, and peppery flavors and aromas for the palate.  This beer may redefine your idea of what beer can be.","abv":"6","availableId":1,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Salads, Spicy dishes, Smoke meats","createDate":"2013-07-14 14:30:55","updateDate":"2015-06-11 15:38:45","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
