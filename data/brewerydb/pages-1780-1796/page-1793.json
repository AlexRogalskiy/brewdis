This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"SH6FdP","name":"Brouwerij Hof ten Dormaal","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij Hof ten Dormaal","website":"http:\/\/www.hoftendormaal.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SH6FdP\/upload_PI9wSW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SH6FdP\/upload_PI9wSW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SH6FdP\/upload_PI9wSW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SH6FdP\/upload_PI9wSW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SH6FdP\/upload_PI9wSW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-29 15:51:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"YUMHU6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Dormaalhof Caubergstraat 2","region":"Tildonk","postalCode":"3150","phone":"+ (32) (477) 515991","website":"http:\/\/www.hoftendormaal.com\/","latitude":50.950764,"longitude":4.66411,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-29 15:52:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9edoDm","name":"Zusammen","nameDisplay":"Zusammen","description":"A rich chocolate stout with a hint of coconut.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"},"breweries":[{"id":"MKImUp","name":"Brauhaus K\u00fchler Krug","nameShortDisplay":"Brauhaus K\u00fchler Krug","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"YwkMHV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Wilhelm-Baur-Str. 3a","locality":"Karlsruhe","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","postalCode":"D-76135","latitude":49.00418,"longitude":8.36873,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:46:09","updateDate":"2017-08-25 14:50:15","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GWRgUD","name":"Zwickel Rick","nameDisplay":"Zwickel Rick","description":"Zwickel Rick: I turned myself into a zwickel, Morty!

They are packaged and\/or served intentionally with low to moderate amounts of yeast. Products may be filtered and again dosed with yeast in the package, manifesting themselves as bottle conditioned beers or unfiltered beer with yeast present. They will most likely not be clear, and may appear slightly hazy to moderately cloudy. Yeast character, flavor and aroma are desirable, yet should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur containing compounds should be apparent in aroma and flavor, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally removed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. Head retention may not be optimal. The brewer must indicate the classic style on which the entry is based to allow for accurate judging. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during evaluation.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"TC6elG","name":"Iowa Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Iowa","description":"Our mission is to brew great beer for the people of Iowa - and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe are a production brewery located in Cedar Rapids between the Downtown and New Bohemia districts and our taproom is an easy walk to our city's cultural and dining attractions.
