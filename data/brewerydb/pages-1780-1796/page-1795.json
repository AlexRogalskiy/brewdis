In almost every competition we judged, the award-winning homebrewed beers were more inventive and daring than the majority of commercially available beers on the market. That insight, along with an enduring passion for the craft of beer making, led us to create the Barebottle, a San Francisco crowd-inspired craft brewery.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy and process is pretty simple:\r\n1) Use the things that inspire us every day from the SF\/Bay Area as the foundation for each new beer we make.\r\n\r\n2) Inspire our merry band of super-talented homebrewing experts (which includes our head brewer, the founders, and some of the bay area\u2019s best homebrewers) to create new beers.\r\n\r\n3) Just like in regular competitions, we pilot-brew a select group of the best finalist beers and ask visitors to the brewery to cast their vote for their favorite beer. May the best beer always win.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this approach will lead to some incredible beers, and we hope you are eager to help us try some of them.- Ben, Lester, and Mike","website":"http:\/\/www.barebottlebeer.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"lesterkoga@gmail.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AQhqDf\/upload_szqAb3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:42","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"O9ERXQA0BL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"44rVs2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1525 Cortland Ave","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94110","website":"http:\/\/www.barebottle.com","latitude":37.7401129,"longitude":-122.409035,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2017-09-20 12:55:53","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"trTycZ","name":"Zythosaurus","nameDisplay":"Zythosaurus","abv":"10","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/trTycZ\/upload_fmo5fa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/trTycZ\/upload_fmo5fa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/trTycZ\/upload_fmo5fa-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/trTycZ\/upload_fmo5fa-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/trTycZ\/upload_fmo5fa-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/trTycZ\/upload_fmo5fa-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-04-19 09:22:43","updateDate":"2015-12-17 03:27:34","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"I1q8kK","name":"Crux Fermentation Project","nameShortDisplay":"Crux Fermentation Project","description":"Crux brewmaster Larry Sidor is always in pursuit of the next great beer\u2014beer that defies taste profiles with its complexity and creativity.

That insight, along with an enduring passion for the craft of beer making, led us to create the Barebottle, a San Francisco crowd-inspired craft brewery.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy and process is pretty simple:\r\n1) Use the things that inspire us every day from the SF\/Bay Area as the foundation for each new beer we make.\r\n\r\n2) Inspire our merry band of super-talented homebrewing experts (which includes our head brewer, the founders, and some of the bay area\u2019s best homebrewers) to create new beers.\r\n\r\n3) Just like in regular competitions, we pilot-brew a select group of the best finalist beers and ask visitors to the brewery to cast their vote for their favorite beer.

We are allowed to sell beer for off-premise consumption directly to customers that have taken a tour of the brewery - but the amount is limited to 288 ounces. We are currently not allowed to do tastings at our facility, nor allow on-premise consumption of alcohol (unless it is part of a scheduled event). As of July 1st, 2013, we can refill growlers - so bring in your clean growler and we'll fill it up!","website":"http:\/\/freysbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/imTpCp\/upload_KuoCNm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/imTpCp\/upload_KuoCNm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/imTpCp\/upload_KuoCNm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/imTpCp\/upload_KuoCNm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/imTpCp\/upload_KuoCNm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-26 01:24:33","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:24:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"FYJ26ZR5HO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DBGYX8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8601 Mapleville Road","locality":"Mount Airy","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21771","website":"http:\/\/freysbrewing.com\/","latitude":39.468591,"longitude":-77.202837,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-26 12:17:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VGdb1d","name":"\u00a1Viva Verde!","nameDisplay":"\u00a1Viva Verde!","description":"Of culinary inspiration, fresh green jalape\u00f1o flavor (without the heat!!) is balanced perfectly with Citra, Simcoe & Amarillo hops.

Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"HW6qMZ","name":"Stamm Beer","nameShortDisplay":"Stamm Beer","website":"http:\/\/Stammbeer.com","mailingListUrl":"info@stammbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-12 19:49:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dNJVmE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0448\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0435, 2","locality":"\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0430","postalCode":"108828","phone":"+7 (985) 265-15-15","latitude":55.431336,"longitude":37.276795,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"RU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-16 19:20:53","updateDate":"2017-08-29 17:35:41","timezoneId":"Europe\/Moscow","country":{"isoCode":"RU","name":"RUSSIAN FEDERATION","displayName":"Russian Federation","isoThree":"RUS","numberCode":643,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WrNfbh","name":"\u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440","nameDisplay":"\u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440","abv":"4.9","ibu":"15","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-02 14:57:15","updateDate":"2016-06-06 18:12:37","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.
