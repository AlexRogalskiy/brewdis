This speaks volumes for the apparent consumer cravings for beers with flavour, and Yukon Red is all about flavour.\r\n\r\nThe drink starts with by displaying a deep bronze colour, but the beer is crystal clear. The head is an abundant fine mousse (pronounced \u2018moose\u2019 for the cabin crowd), cream coloured and just spilling over the rim of the glass (if you got the good waitress, Yukon trained and all). As you raise the mug, your senses catch the fine aromas permeating from the glass, clean malty sweetness touched by spicy hop esters.\r\n\r\nThe first draw of the ale cools the parched lips and moistens the cheeks. Full malt body takes over the palate; not sweet, but bold, fruity and persistent. A snap of clean hop bitter grabs the back of the tongue and springs into the sinus cavity, blending with the caramel flavours that have wafted back with the nectar that is this ale. But the swallow goes down clean, almost dry, and leaves only a slight lingering presence of the abundant flavours that were just there, and now gone!\r\n\r\nMany more draws on the mug, many more mouth-filling flavour experiences, and always that clean finish, saying \u201cHow about another?!!\u201d.\r\n\r\nCan you tell that this is the head brewers favourite?

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"q4luwR","name":"Moon Under Water","nameShortDisplay":"Moon Under Water","description":"The Moon is a true \u201cbeer bar\u201d, which means a selection of only the finest brews, paired with food designed for every taste and even serving the beers in new glassware appropriate to the style of beer. \r\n\r\nThe new Moon beers can be described as \u2018German-fusion\u2019 and are Brewmaster Clay\u2019s West-coast interpretation of traditional German styles.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.","website":"http:\/\/www.sierranevada.com\/","established":"1980","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/sierranevada.us2.list-manage.com\/subscribe\/post?u=ea6ec3b82ca5de4ee2c18f217&id=444c4ceab9","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nHLlnK\/upload_IClwuZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nHLlnK\/upload_IClwuZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nHLlnK\/upload_IClwuZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nHLlnK\/upload_IClwuZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nHLlnK\/upload_IClwuZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:43:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KW6PEIZ4S8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"IaQrxj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1075 East 20th St","locality":"Chico","region":"California","postalCode":"95928","phone":"530-893-3520","website":"http:\/\/www.sierranevada.com\/","latitude":39.7246028,"longitude":-121.8157154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1980","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"aqLvLE","name":"Asheville","streetAddress":"100 Sierra Nevada Way","locality":"Fletcher","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28732","latitude":35.4303824,"longitude":-82.5489214,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-29 20:56:05","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:13:13","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CzVQv3","name":"Z Dam","nameDisplay":"Z Dam","description":"Emerging from the heights of Appalachian Mountains, The James River flows down to the banks of Richmond City and beyond, passing through a series of majestic dams and rapids along the way.

This pale-gold ale sports a light body and a clean malt flavor. Refreshing and quenching, Z Dam evokes an acute zestiness driven by a balance of late kettle hops and the addition of ginger, orange, and lime in the boil.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"pMsqwL","name":"Fort Collins Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Fort Collins","description":"Fort Collins Brewery & Tavern is a family-owned, handcrafted microbrewery and full service tavern in Northern Colorado, established in 2003.
