In 1993, we repurposed a small corner of our brewery and began distilling whiskey from a mash of 100% rye malt. We call it Old Potrero\u00ae. Although we've experimented with beer and hops in the distillery, we've never used rye or sour mash in the brewery\u2014until now. This Zymaster, Potrero Hill Sour-Mash IPA, begins in our distillery, where we prepare a 100% rye malt mash just as we would for our rye whiskey. After transferring it to a small open fermenter, we pitch the yeast and wait. Five days later, we mash it in the brewhouse, using a blend of pale barley malt and rye malt. Then we add the sour mash from the distillery, which lowers the pH of our brewery mash. By introducing sour mash before the boil instead of after it, we are able to create tartness in this brew without sourness. In the brewkettle, we use four additions of Nelson Sauvin, a dual-purpose hop from New Zealand. We also dry-hop with Nelson, which creates Zymaster 7's unique tropical aroma. An English ale yeast contributes dry, clean flavors.","abv":"7","srmId":17,"availableId":2,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2xX7c\/upload_XtnOKk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2xX7c\/upload_XtnOKk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2xX7c\/upload_XtnOKk-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2xX7c\/upload_XtnOKk-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2xX7c\/upload_XtnOKk-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R2xX7c\/upload_XtnOKk-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-28 00:22:10","updateDate":"2015-12-17 19:32:48","srm":{"id":17,"name":"17","hex":"B04500"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"1MCesn","name":"Birra del Borgo","nameShortDisplay":"Birra del Borgo","website":"http:\/\/www.birradelborgo.it\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"YTeFCL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Loc Piana di Spedino snc","locality":"Borgorose","region":"Provincia di Rieti","postalCode":"02021","phone":"(338) 4265121","website":"http:\/\/www.birradelborgo.it\/","latitude":42.163923,"longitude":13.270613,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2017-11-16 16:24:55","timezoneId":"Europe\/Rome","country":{"isoCode":"IT","name":"ITALY","displayName":"Italy","isoThree":"ITA","numberCode":380,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VgOUWR","name":"Zythophile Azacca","nameDisplay":"Zythophile Azacca","description":"American two row malted barley, a sprinkle of light caramalt, and Azacca hops.","abv":"6.6","ibu":"63","availableId":2,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-06 19:26:28","updateDate":"2015-08-06 19:26:28","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
