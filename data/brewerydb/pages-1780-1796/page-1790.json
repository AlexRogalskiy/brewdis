It was a \u201cbrown beer\u201d brewery as was customary in those times. While a great deal has changed in the meantime, essential features have survived. Thus, Maxlrain is and remains a local private brewery under independent management. The fifteen styles of beer classified under pale ale, dark ale, Pils or wheat beer are all brewed applying manual skills utilizing finest ingredients enhanced by our own source of spring water drawn from the Mangfall Valley.","website":"http:\/\/www.maxlrain.de\/","established":"1636","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-30 20:25:26","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1CemsR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Aiblinger Str. 1","locality":"Maxlrain","region":"Tuntenhausen","postalCode":"83104","phone":"+49 (0)8061 \/ 9079-0","website":"http:\/\/www.maxlrain.de\/en\/","latitude":47.89838,"longitude":11.98821,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-08 17:12:19","updateDate":"2016-04-04 20:03:54","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pVveVN","name":"Zwiefalter Abt","nameDisplay":"Zwiefalter Abt","description":"An unfiltered beer of excellent quality, which is brewed according to old, traditional recipe.","abv":"5.3","styleId":56,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:05:54","updateDate":"2012-08-19 16:01:42","style":{"id":56,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Kellerbier (Cellar beer) or Zwickelbier - Ale","shortName":"Kellerbier","description":"These beers are unfiltered German-style Altbier and K\u00f6lsch.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"Jc7iGI","name":"Brauerei und Gasthof Zw\u00f6nitz","nameShortDisplay":"Brauerei und Gasthof Zw\u00f6nitz","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"zlv5Mp","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Sachsen","latitude":49.294457,"longitude":10.405836,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:39:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"jQnQ5W","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Gr\u00fcnhainer Str. 15","locality":"Zw\u00f6nitz","region":"Sachsen","postalCode":"D-08297","latitude":50.6277384,"longitude":12.8150522,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:48:18","updateDate":"2017-08-28 15:43:58","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
