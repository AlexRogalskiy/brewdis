Easy\u2026to trap their arch-nemesis in a solid block of ice and monologue away for hours, while their foe slowly dies of hypothermia and\/or boredom. Sure, freezing things with a laser may sound weirdly impractical, but that is before you knew it could be used on Strangeways\u2019 newest concoction, Freeze Ray Eisbock. After benumbing a thick and malty doppelbock for days, we mined the resulting colossal chunks of ice from the vat to extract the pesky water obstructing the full potential of this deliciously decadent libation. Its thick and creamy mouthfeel is interlaced with a prevalent chocolaty richness that seductively satiates. Nevermind where we hide the 10.24% abv, as the Freeze Ray disintegrates any booziness with a mere controlled pull of the trigger.","abv":"10.24","ibu":"29","availableId":2,"styleId":91,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qfDw6q\/upload_e2WRo6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qfDw6q\/upload_e2WRo6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qfDw6q\/upload_e2WRo6-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qfDw6q\/upload_e2WRo6-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qfDw6q\/upload_e2WRo6-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qfDw6q\/upload_e2WRo6-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-05 13:44:44","updateDate":"2015-12-17 22:11:35","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":91,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Eisbock","shortName":"Eisbock","description":"A stronger version of Doppelbock.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

There is sweetness from the strong beer, a little acid from apples to freshen up, and bitterness from the hops, which are long in the mouth.\r\n\r\nEnjoy with a heavy casserole, for example the game and mushrooms, or drink it as a seaman diet with a glass of dark rum!\r\n\r\nFregatten Jylland should be enjoyed by approximately 10-12 degrees to enjoy all the exciting flavors.

As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.  We also offer a large selection of canned and bottled beer, ciders and mead, along with wine and liquor.","website":"http:\/\/www.cloudsbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-06 13:38:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:37:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SBMZWF10QE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"c2Ifvu","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"126 N.
