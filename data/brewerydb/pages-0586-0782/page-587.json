India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.\r\n\r\nBut there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. \r\n\r\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: \u201cWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?\u201d\r\n\r\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they\u2019ll be quite pleased.","abv":"6.9","ibu":"65","glasswareId":5,"srmId":10,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3RFxH6\/upload_LeYZWe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3RFxH6\/upload_LeYZWe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3RFxH6\/upload_LeYZWe-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3RFxH6\/upload_LeYZWe-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3RFxH6\/upload_LeYZWe-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3RFxH6\/upload_LeYZWe-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.061","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:12","updateDate":"2015-12-16 04:54:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":10,"name":"10","hex":"DE7C00"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

This style of beer is unfiltered and appears hazy in the glass.  Careful temperature control during the fermentation gives the beer clove, banana and even a bit of bubblegum in the nose.  The hopping is all German, with the exception of a small last minute addition of American hops.  The result is a subtle citrus aroma in this already great tasting German-style wheat beer.","abv":"5","availableId":4,"styleId":113,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cbpgy7\/upload_ViYkbA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cbpgy7\/upload_ViYkbA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cbpgy7\/upload_ViYkbA-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cbpgy7\/upload_ViYkbA-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cbpgy7\/upload_ViYkbA-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cbpgy7\/upload_ViYkbA-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Enjoy on a sunny day with some white hots, fish or spicy food.","createDate":"2012-07-30 22:37:52","updateDate":"2015-12-16 17:18:30","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":113,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager without Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Following several years of bad harvests, it was ruled that only barley would be used for brewing beer and that rye would be used in baking, only. Rye was reintroduced to brewing in Germany in 1988 producing a grainy beer with a hearty flavor similar to pumpernickel bread. It was dark in color and averaged 5% alc.\/vol. Many other Red Rye Ales on the market today push the hops to make them rival the IPA s (sometimes referred to as Rye Pas). \r\n\r\nThe Fink Red Rye Ale formula calls for a 20% substitution of rye malt for our usual barley grain blend. Thus, Fink retains that caramel \u201cnose\u201d familiar with other Bad Tom brews, while producing a light, dry beer with a crisp taste and a spicy finish. As you would expect, our red rye has a distinctive reddish color with a creamy head and medium lace.

They embarked on a research road trip to the \u201cbeer capitol,\u201d Denver, Colorado, for some inspiration. There, they developed the vision of Prairie Sun Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter 19 months their vision became a reality as they took their passion and hard work, and brewed their first batch of beer on a 10-barrel system. Starting a business is no easy task\u2026starting a craft brewery is even tougher. Luckily, they were able to find most of the equipment needed to make it happen from Hogs Head Brewery in St. Albert, Alberta. In May 2013, Heather and Cameron found the perfect home at the former \u201cSaskatoon Bakery\u201d and they moved in! By June 2015, Prairie Sun had grown to 12 employees and could be found in many restaurants around Saskatoon.
