Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:27:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"8wcv7h","name":"Widmer Brothers Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Widmer Brothers","description":"Widmer Brothers Brewing is located in beautiful and brew-friendly Portland, OR.

Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber\/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"T5BA340M8O","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QkdgSV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1430 North 7th Street","locality":"Murphysboro","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"62966","phone":"(618) 684-8833","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","latitude":37.7823381,"longitude":-89.3321145,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7pQB0H","name":"Galaxy IPA","nameDisplay":"Galaxy IPA","description":"Fresh off of the Australian vines, Galaxy is the star of this single hopped IPA bursting with notes of mango and papaya.","abv":"6.8","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-16 22:02:16","updateDate":"2014-09-18 15:36:25","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

We opened in June of 2015, making us the second oldest brewery in Athens!\r\n\r\n Like many of today's best microbreweries, the origins of Devil's Kettle go back to a kitchen stovetop, with some pots and buckets. Brewmaster Cameron Fuller grew up around winemaking, but when he reached college, his interests shifted towards beer. Unlike most undergrads, Fuller had a passion for craft beers, but affordability was an issue for a college student. He decided to teach himself how to make his own beer with just the help of the internet and some of his family's old winemaking equipment. Not surprisingly, the early beers were less than desirable, but a fire was lit.\r\n\r\n For the next 8 years, Fuller focused on perfecting his craft. The beers got better and the reviews were great, but how true is the praise from people who are given free beer? In 2013, Fuller entered a number of his beers in the Ohio Brew Week homebrew competition to get some unbiased feedback, with the mindset that if he did \"well enough\", then he would consider going pro. Well, \"good enough\" was never in question. He won the most medals in the competition and Best in Show. Not only was the path to professional brewing before him, he was practically being pushed down it.\r\n\r\n\u200bThe next 2 years comprised of financing, finding a location, and developing it to become a brewery. A lot of hard work paid off and we were able to open with a world class brew system, a gorgeous taproom, and an eviable amount of space to grow and improve our operations. We couldn't be happier with what we have and we can't wait to share it with you!\r\n\r\n\u200b","website":"https:\/\/www.devilskettlebrew.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-26 23:44:50","updateDate":"2019-07-03 20:12:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7P8N5RWYS3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"M1gpEp","name":"Devil's Kettle Brewing","streetAddress":"97 Columbus Rd","locality":"Athens","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45701","phone":"(740) 589-7187","latitude":39.3492074,"longitude":-82.0954267,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-26 23:49:06","updateDate":"2015-06-26 23:49:06","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"aTNJvc","name":"Gallatin Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Gallatin Pale Ale","description":"The same pale that you know and love with a brand new look!

Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"MEZupX","name":"Bozeman Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Bozeman","description":"With necessity being the mother of invention\u2026Bozeman Brewing was born.\r\n\r\nLet us explain\u2026\r\n\r\nWhen Todd Scott met his future wife Lisa Danzl while both were working and playing in Yellowstone National Park in 1986, they conceived a dream together: To one day live off the land. It was a dream inspired by a trip to Alaska and a love for the outdoors, and one day, darn it, they were going to make it happen.\r\n\r\nThe couple moved to Tahoe, where Todd put his culinary degree to work as a sous chef while they skied. It was here that they decided it was time to become self-sufficient. Todd had every intention of making their own soap, toothpaste, even toilet paper. But one thing haunted him\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to live without beer. He had no choice; the first step was to learn how to make his own. And that was also the last step.\r\n\r\nTodd\u2019s natural knack for home brewing, made with borrowed equipment, quickly trumped the couple\u2019s off-the-grid dreams. And let\u2019s just say that Lisa wasn\u2019t all that disappointed\u2026now she didn\u2019t have to use the homemade toilet paper for starters, but she also got to drink some damn good beer. Todd and Lisa had never tasted such fine brew, and they knew they were on to something special.\r\n\r\nThat was just the beginning of the journey towards BBC beer. The rest goes something like this\u2026\r\n\r\nTodd refined his beer making skills for a brewery in Calistoga, while working another job and taking classes on the art and science of beer fermentation at UC Davis. But all the while, Montana beckoned.\r\n\r\nTodd scored a job as the head brewer for Spanish Peaks in Bozeman\u2015a position he held for 10 years\u2015and Lisa worked for the City. When Spanish Peaks moved production to California, Todd and Lisa knew it was time to bring their own fine brews to the beer drinkers of Bozeman. They bought the equipment and opened the doors to the Bozeman Brewing Company warehouse in 2001, on the edge of Bozeman\u2019s historic Brewery District on the north side.\r\n\r\nThere, Bozeman Brewing\u2019s flagship beer, Bozone Amber Ale (based on a recipe that Todd had perfected over the years), made its way to the beer drinkers of Montana and beyond. Today, the same warehouse rotates more than 6 seasonal ales and lagers, along with the regulars Hopzone IPA, Gallatin Pale, Plum Street Porter and Two O'clock Wheat.","website":"http:\/\/www.bozemanbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MEZupX\/upload_VV5tlg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:04:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"R8YCXEGB3D","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"FNU4qr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"504 North Broadway Avenue","locality":"Bozeman","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59715","phone":"406-585-9142","website":"http:\/\/www.bozemanbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat -Thur 2pm to 8pm\r\nFriday noon-8pm","latitude":45.685188,"longitude":-111.0238569,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2016-08-10 15:11:58","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sat -Thur 2pm to 8pm\r\nFriday noon-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DKwFdT","name":"Gallatin Roar","nameDisplay":"Gallatin Roar","abv":"12.3","ibu":"92","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-03 18:05:13","updateDate":"2018-07-03 18:05:13","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
