Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"21","abvMin":"5.6","abvMax":"8.6","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"rMRXCP","name":"Hoparazzi Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Hoparazzi","website":"http:\/\/Hoparazzi Brewing Co","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"hoparazzibrewingco@gmail.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rMRXCP\/upload_CcepFe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rMRXCP\/upload_CcepFe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rMRXCP\/upload_CcepFe-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rMRXCP\/upload_CcepFe-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rMRXCP\/upload_CcepFe-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-14 06:55:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:34:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WESXVUF5N9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"zu1b73","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2910 E.

Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.
