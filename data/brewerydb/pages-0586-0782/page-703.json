If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Syndrome. If you\u2019ve never heard of it, we can\u2019t blame you. But it\u2019s right here in the New Brooklyn Dictionary: \r\n\u201cHammarby Syndrome is the distress or impairment caused by the frenzied anticipation and giddy obsession over the beautiful Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad section of Stockholm, Sweden and the New Carnegie Brewer y that Brooklyn Brewer y will open there in March. The cognitive hallmark of Hammarby Syndrome is preoccupying thoughts of Hammarby and New Carnegie Brewer y\u2019s delicious new beers. Sufferers typically report a combination of depressive and anxious symptoms, withdrawn behavior and difficulty focusing on topics unrelated to Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad. Other symptoms include dry mouth and deep thirst.\u201d Now there\u2019s good news - we can help\r\nyou!\r\n\r\nOur new Brewmaster\u2019s Reservebeer is Hammarby Syndrome, a robust ale that will transport you directly to the seaside of old Stockholm. It\u2019s brewed from a large proportion of spelt, an ancient wheat-like grain that was once a mainstay of Scandinavian beers. To the spelt\u2019s distinctively nutty flavor, we\u2019ve added another old Swedish beer ingredient - spruce fronds. They add a tasty citrusy pine note to a full-bodied, lightly fruity strong ale that\u2019ll keep you warm until the spring sunshine comes to the rescue. More importantly, it\u2019s great with hearty cold-weather food, and it\u2019ll make you feel like you\u2019re in Hammarby until you can come visit us there yourself.","abv":"8","availableId":2,"styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zBriCg\/upload_o6ceUd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zBriCg\/upload_o6ceUd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zBriCg\/upload_o6ceUd-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zBriCg\/upload_o6ceUd-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zBriCg\/upload_o6ceUd-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/zBriCg\/upload_o6ceUd-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.074","createDate":"2014-06-13 20:42:45","updateDate":"2018-12-20 22:09:28","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"G9uBTm","name":"Hammerbraeu Riesa","nameShortDisplay":"Hammerbraeu Riesa","website":"http:\/\/www.hammerbraeu.de\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"R9Ckuq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Bahnhofstra\u00dfe 42","locality":"Riesa","postalCode":"01587","latitude":51.30197,"longitude":13.26639,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 13:04:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cmy21C","name":"Hammered Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Hammered Hefeweizen","abv":"6.3","ibu":"35","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cmy21C\/upload_BECTEg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cmy21C\/upload_BECTEg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cmy21C\/upload_BECTEg-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cmy21C\/upload_BECTEg-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cmy21C\/upload_BECTEg-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cmy21C\/upload_BECTEg-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-31 10:48:13","updateDate":"2017-09-12 18:19:15","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

We offer an eclectic mix of pubs, historic hotels, 25 breweries, movie theaters, concert venues, spas, events and just pure fun. \r\nSince our first brew at the Hillsdale Brewery & Public House in 1985, McMenamins has produced more than 75,000 batches. \r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly. Waste products are given to local farmers, where they can be used; materials used are recycled or reused whenever possible; and second-hand equipment is largely used. Have a look at our earth-friendly brewing practices.\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales: Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Due to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment. Whether you're in Seattle, Salem, Roseburg or Portland, breweries with the iconic McMenamins name are near.

The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans.

In 1924 the Fort George Building was erected to house an automotive repair facility until the late 1990's. Briefly abandoned and sadly neglected, the Fort George building has been recently revitalized as a home to the Blue Schorcher Bakery and our brewpub.

Our building offered a spacious workable layout, ample parking and room for future expansion. We began our building renovations and equipment installation in early 2010,  received our license in the fall of 2010, and on November 11th, 2010 opened our doors for tours, tastings, and growler fills. \r\n\r\nOur Brew Room features a matched Ripley 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Brewing system. The Brew House includes a Boil Kettle, Mash Tun and Hot Liquor Tank. The Brew Room also features 3 double wall digital temperature controlled fermentation tanks, grain mill, filter, and other assorted brewing equipment.
