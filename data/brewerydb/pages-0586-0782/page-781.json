Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Upon arriving in California from Minnesota in the late 80\u2019s, he discovered that just about every trombone player he knew was also a brewer, so about 10 years later (hey, it\u2019s never too late, right?) he jumped on the brewing bandwagon, beginning with extract brewing as so many do, then \u201cstepping up\u201d (see what I did there?)  to all grain brewing a few years later. After a couple of years a few of his beers did well in competitions (a bourbon aged imperial coffee stout scored a 46 out of 50 in the National Homebrew Competition but failed to advance because it was named an \u201cImperial\u201d stout and wasn\u2019t quite up to the level of Yeti or Bourbon County Coffee Stout (words actually used by the BJCP judges). But the next year, a Belgian Dark Strong Ale too the silver medal in the NHC regionals in St. Paul, MN and went on to the final round at the NHC in Grand Rapids, MI. Later that year, a Belgian styled sour aged on black currants won the Blue ribbon in its category and division at the Big Fresno Fair. At that point, Wayne had decided to dive into the world of brewing craft beer for the good people of Fresno while still maintaining his musical career. For those of you curious about the brewery\u2019s name, a Sackbut is a Renaissance trombone which was invented around the year 1450 or so. It still looks basically the same today as it did upon its inception 565 years ago. And c\u2019mon-how awesome is a work that has \u201cSack\u201d and \u201cBut\u201d in it?? I hope you enjoy Sackbut\u2019s beer as much as you enjoy saying the brewery name! Prost!!","website":"http:\/\/sackbutbrewing.cumingsconsulting.com\/about-us\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1sOSKe\/upload_9d1EuY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1sOSKe\/upload_9d1EuY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1sOSKe\/upload_9d1EuY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1sOSKe\/upload_9d1EuY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1sOSKe\/upload_9d1EuY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:01:30","updateDate":"2019-08-14 13:30:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Abu2Ka","name":"Sackbut Brewing and Barrelwerks","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","website":"http:\/\/sackbutbrewing.com\/","latitude":36.7377981,"longitude":-119.7871247,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-17 17:53:50","updateDate":"2018-09-17 17:53:50","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2AxqDQ","name":"Hopago","nameDisplay":"Hopago","description":"Hopago is a dry, bright IPA with a sharp hop bite.

This vessel adds more time and more hop character that creates a fresh, spicy taste and rich caramel note that defines this signature ale.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"55","glasswareId":5,"srmId":22,"availableId":1,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lx2yEl\/upload_Ljdmtv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lx2yEl\/upload_Ljdmtv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lx2yEl\/upload_Ljdmtv-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lx2yEl\/upload_Ljdmtv-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lx2yEl\/upload_Ljdmtv-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lx2yEl\/upload_Ljdmtv-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:25","updateDate":"2015-12-15 23:19:54","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":22,"name":"22","hex":"8E2900"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fDGSy6","name":"Hopbahn Double IPA","nameDisplay":"Hopbahn Double IPA","description":"Beach Haus\u00ae Hopbahn showcases both strength and complexity.
