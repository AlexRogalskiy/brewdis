Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"02btbz","name":"R\u00fcgener Insel-Brauerei","nameShortDisplay":"R\u00fcgener Insel-Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.insel-brauerei.de\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/02btbz\/upload_GRMneb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/02btbz\/upload_GRMneb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/02btbz\/upload_GRMneb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/02btbz\/upload_GRMneb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/02btbz\/upload_GRMneb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-26 12:47:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QrmchJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Hauptstr. 2C","locality":"Rambin auf R\u00fcgen","region":"Mecklenburg-Vorpommern","postalCode":"18573","website":"http:\/\/www.insel-brauerei.de\/","latitude":54.3537408,"longitude":13.2005445,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-26 12:47:58","updateDate":"2016-08-26 12:47:58","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7qHK4d","name":"German Crossing Hefe","nameDisplay":"German Crossing Hefe","description":"The ferry crossing connection of Brunswick to our German neighbors in Lovettsville along the Potomac River was known as the \"German Crossing\".","abv":"5.2","ibu":"17","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7qHK4d\/upload_R676QF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7qHK4d\/upload_R676QF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7qHK4d\/upload_R676QF-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7qHK4d\/upload_R676QF-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7qHK4d\/upload_R676QF-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7qHK4d\/upload_R676QF-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-28 17:40:57","updateDate":"2019-05-28 17:41:57","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
