Cheers.","website":"http:\/\/www.hangar24brewery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:09:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"32OIQF89BH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"883Pwt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1710 Sessums Drive","locality":"Redlands","region":"California","postalCode":"92374","phone":"909-389-1400","website":"http:\/\/www.hangar24brewery.com\/","latitude":34.082555,"longitude":-117.13932,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"22KyLG","name":"Helles Lager","nameDisplay":"Helles Lager","description":"Light bready pilsner malt is the dominant character in this light, clean, and quaffable lager.","abv":"4.5","ibu":"20","glasswareId":4,"srmId":2,"availableId":1,"styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2017-07-06 15:54:57","updateDate":"2017-07-06 17:38:34","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":2,"name":"2","hex":"FFD878"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.

We then use this as a foundation to build upon, but that doesn\u2019t always mean straying too far from the original, more evolution than revolution. We have a humble approach to what we know, as it seems the more we learn, the more it becomes apparent how little we really know.\r\n\r\nWe strive to strike a balance between bold flavours and drinkability. Beer is, at the end of the day, something to drink and enjoy, not everything needs to be overly challenging or contemplative.\r\n\r\nWe decided to base our company in beautiful North Cornwall, mainly because we love the lifestyle that the area allows us, but also because of the purity of the spring water.\r\n\r\nWe love what we do, and we do what we love.","website":"https:\/\/www.harbourbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/anExHv\/upload_pWDzeE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/anExHv\/upload_pWDzeE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/anExHv\/upload_pWDzeE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/anExHv\/upload_pWDzeE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/anExHv\/upload_pWDzeE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-06 16:02:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Swpv5c","name":"Harbour Brewing Co Ltd","streetAddress":"Trekillick Farm","locality":"Kirland","region":"Bodmin","postalCode":"PL30 5BB","phone":"+44 1208 832131","website":"https:\/\/www.harbourbrewing.com\/","latitude":50.453469,"longitude":-4.7369982,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-06 16:06:05","updateDate":"2018-03-06 16:06:05","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cxYcHQ","name":"Helles Lager","nameDisplay":"Helles Lager","styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:22","updateDate":"2012-06-22 18:18:13","style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"O1ypTG","name":"Great American Restaurants","nameShortDisplay":"Great American Restaurants","description":"In 1974, Randy Norton and Jim Farley opened a 16 table pizza place in Fairfax City, VA.

While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, \u201cAmerican beers are boring and just are not very satisfying\u201d. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County\u2019s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage\u2019s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo\u2019s, BJ\u2019s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.\r\n\r\nMark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time.

If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"g9Xpss","name":"Earnest Brew Works","nameShortDisplay":"Earnest Brew Works","description":"Earnest Brew Works is a brewery and taproom coming to Toledo in 2016.","website":"http:\/\/www.earnestbrewworks.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g9Xpss\/upload_Fil2oO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g9Xpss\/upload_Fil2oO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g9Xpss\/upload_Fil2oO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g9Xpss\/upload_Fil2oO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g9Xpss\/upload_Fil2oO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-12 20:27:30","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:10:28","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6Q8IBZD0TU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ykSUbJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4342 S.

In 2012, a group of Colorado Natives formed the Tivoli Brewing Company to bring this Colorado legend back to life.
