There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2EFCjw","name":"Guava Trees","nameDisplay":"Guava Trees","description":"Sparkling Wheat ale made with guava puree, Pinot Gris juice and fermented with wine yeast.

The dynamic duo first met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute of Technology. They were both studying Brewing Science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated, with flying colors, and shared a mutual desire to open a brewery.

It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:40:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M8ICS1LEDY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wbpj5b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3912 W McLean Ave","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60647","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.9180876,"longitude":-87.7260612,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-06-16 17:16:46","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NFhpcw","name":"Guavatanamo Bay","nameDisplay":"Guavatanamo Bay","description":"Guava and Passion Fruit dark sour.","abv":"4","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-01 03:22:15","updateDate":"2017-06-01 14:30:47","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.  Our best example of this is our Blood Saison, an agave and Hibiscus infused Saison that come off sweet initially, middle tartness and finishing like a beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@borderxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:08:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OPB6VTC7RN","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"IDHs4u","name":"Logan Tasting Room","streetAddress":"2181 Logan Ave","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92113","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":32.6981181,"longitude":-117.1397986,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2017-06-28 14:43:12","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cRLX8x","name":"Otay Brewery","streetAddress":"8684 Avenida De La Fuente Ste 8","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92154","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","latitude":32.5566393,"longitude":-116.9567988,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-02-18 16:21:01","updateDate":"2017-06-28 14:42:41","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HzOdbY","name":"Guayabera","nameDisplay":"Guayabera","description":"Traditional throughout Latin America, the guayabera shirt combines style, functionality, form and tradition in its four-pocketed design.

We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mf905I","name":"G\u00fcdenhoppy Pils","nameDisplay":"G\u00fcdenhoppy Pils","description":"Our Head Brewer traveled to Europe on a drinking binge.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"em9Lxc","name":"Two Roads Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Two Roads","description":"Two Roads isn\u2019t just the logo on our brewery building, it\u2019s our philosophy.
