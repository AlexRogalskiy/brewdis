After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery.

These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"aVq6l0","name":"Silver Moon Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Silver Moon","description":"Silver Moon Brewing is the 3rd oldest craft brewery in Bend, Oregon.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"o9yWqF","name":"Country Boy Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Country Boy","description":"Country Boy Brewing was founded in late 2011 by three country boys who like beer and had a similar goal of making and drinking good beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.countryboybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/o9yWqF\/upload_4DzKdD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/o9yWqF\/upload_4DzKdD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/o9yWqF\/upload_4DzKdD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/o9yWqF\/upload_4DzKdD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/o9yWqF\/upload_4DzKdD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-15 19:40:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:14:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RF1OD97XGS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"W4JNkr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"436 Chair Street","locality":"Lexington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"40508","phone":"859-554-6200","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Wed: 4PM - 10PM\r\nThu-Fri: 4PM-Midnight\r\nSat: Noon - Midnight\r\nSun: 1PM - 9PM","latitude":38.043848,"longitude":-84.508801,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-15 19:41:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon-Wed: 4PM - 10PM\r\nThu-Fri: 4PM-Midnight\r\nSat: Noon - Midnight\r\nSun: 1PM - 9PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MeZ3rO","name":"Country Boy Brewing","streetAddress":"101 innovation way","locality":"Georgetown","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"40324","website":"www.countryboybrewing.com","latitude":38.2666781,"longitude":-84.5140511,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-18 18:19:18","updateDate":"2019-06-19 17:34:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bGVSqI","name":"Ghost Hammer","nameDisplay":"Ghost Hammer","description":"Stone Ghost Hammer IPA is unfiltered and loaded with Loral hops - making it a floral, lemony and tropical IPA that is best enjoyed in the summer.","abv":"6.7","ibu":"56","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bGVSqI\/upload_01XyMI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bGVSqI\/upload_01XyMI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bGVSqI\/upload_01XyMI-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bGVSqI\/upload_01XyMI-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bGVSqI\/upload_01XyMI-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bGVSqI\/upload_01XyMI-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-05-25 18:16:30","updateDate":"2017-09-11 12:07:11","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"f4lJDc","name":"Brasserie Fant\u00f4me","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie Fant\u00f4me","website":"http:\/\/www.fantome.be\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f4lJDc\/upload_kw37ZD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f4lJDc\/upload_kw37ZD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f4lJDc\/upload_kw37ZD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f4lJDc\/upload_kw37ZD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f4lJDc\/upload_kw37ZD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-03-06 19:36:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"79E0Ty","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Rue Pr\u00e9al 8","locality":"Soy","region":"Luxembourg","postalCode":"6997","phone":"+32 86 47 70 44","website":"http:\/\/www.fantome.be\/","latitude":50.28564,"longitude":5.51107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RHCqE0","name":"Ghost in the Machine","nameDisplay":"Ghost in the Machine","description":"A full bodied and roasty beer with chocolate and coffee notes from the use of darker kilned and dehusked malts.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.
