They drank the beer from Mechelenian buckets, glasses with a content from half a litre to more than 1 litre. And because our brewery is so deeply anchored in tradition, we are the only ones who brew this beer until this day. The recipe originates from the 14th century. The balance between the different malts, the fine hops and the typical taste of herbs creates a perfect harmony between the powerful taste of brown beers and the light freshness of blonde beers. This aromatic light-brown beer is at his best served cool.","abv":"8","ibu":"30","glasswareId":6,"availableId":1,"styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dZ0mKT\/upload_O0raJi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dZ0mKT\/upload_O0raJi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dZ0mKT\/upload_O0raJi-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dZ0mKT\/upload_O0raJi-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dZ0mKT\/upload_O0raJi-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/dZ0mKT\/upload_O0raJi-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:18","updateDate":"2015-12-15 20:44:58","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

By their second date, it was clear that they would go on to do great things together-- it just took about six years to figure out what those things were. During that time, Rob cultivated his passion and skill for homebrewing and received an Associates Degree in Brewing Science from the Siebel Institute.  Then, with full support from Ali, he started an invaluable internship at Port Jeff Brewing Company in Long Island. \r\n\r\nIt was a long commute from Brooklyn, and even longer work hours, but Rob's love for brewing only grew. His passion rubbed off on Ali, who had over the years become a self-professed beer snob, and she began reading up on the business side of brewing. Eventually it became clear that the two would open their own brewery.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"HPfwPW","name":"Westbrook Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Westbrook","description":"Westbrook Brewing is a new craft brewery in Mt.
