Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.

The brewery is now in Longmont, CO - a much larger town just east of Lyons. Oskar Blues is unique in that it serves craft-brewed beer in cans, contrary to the normal practice of bottling micro brews. The brewery is owned by Dale Katechis, a native of Florence, Alabama who brought canned beer and southern fried foods together for an interesting twist on the micro-brew pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2019-10-11 21:00:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jnSdDd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 Pike Rd","extendedAddress":"Unit B","locality":"Longmont","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80501","phone":"1-303-776-1914","website":"http:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/","latitude":40.1389968,"longitude":-105.1227417,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:46:27","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"I1q8kK","name":"Brevard","streetAddress":"342 Mountain Industrial Dr.","locality":"Brevard","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28712","phone":"(828) 883-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room\r\nMonday-Sunday: 12pm-8pm\r\n\r\nFree Brewery Tours\r\nMonday-Thursday: 4pm\r\nFriday-Sunday: 2pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm","latitude":35.2534666,"longitude":-82.706852,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-13 15:22:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tasting Room\r\nMonday-Sunday: 12pm-8pm\r\n\r\nFree Brewery Tours\r\nMonday-Thursday: 4pm\r\nFriday-Sunday: 2pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"TkDbDx","name":"Oskar Blues","streetAddress":"10420 Metric Blvd","extendedAddress":"#150","locality":"Austin","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78758","phone":"(512) 243-7054","website":"https:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/brewery\/austin","hoursOfOperation":"Mon -
