This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"LFkVMc","name":"Brewery Vivant","nameShortDisplay":"Brewery Vivant","description":"Brewery Vivant is the realization of years of dreaming and much discussion of what a great brewery can be.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"smcJCr","name":"Habitual Offender","nameDisplay":"Habitual Offender","description":"Our fourth collab with Northern Monk, hence the name, hence the quad-y type beer!
