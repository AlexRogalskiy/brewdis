The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"JGQ4db","name":"JW Lees and Co (Brewers) Ltd.","nameShortDisplay":"JW Lees and Co (Brewers) Ltd.","website":"https:\/\/www.jwlees.co.uk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JGQ4db\/upload_gjhWER-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"x4Dnt0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Middleton Junction","locality":"Manchester","region":"Manchester","phone":"44-(0161)-6432487","latitude":53.479605,"longitude":-2.248818,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0WsY30","name":"Harvest Ale (Lagavulin)","nameDisplay":"Harvest Ale (Lagavulin) (2011)","abv":"11.5","styleId":17,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2011,"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-30 21:02:33","updateDate":"2014-07-30 21:02:33","style":{"id":17,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"British Barleywine","description":"British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.
