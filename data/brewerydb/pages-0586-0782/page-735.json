Since we came from very different backgrounds with diverse sets of experiences and talents, we joined forces to create beer that can be enjoyed not only by craft beer experts, but also by those who just want something tasty to drink after going for a bike ride.\r\n\r\nThough we all got to this point in our lives in different ways, we strongly agree on West Sixth\u2019s goals. We will provide a taproom and beer garden where the beer list is never the same but that is always local. We will be a brewery that measures its success not only by making great craft beer but also by how it helps our community. We will always strive to protect our environment even if it costs us more to do so. And last, but not least, we all share a desire to create the best beer possible and to be an integral part of building a great beer culture for our great town.","website":"http:\/\/www.westsixth.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-15 19:52:18","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:02:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"UN34IR9QF6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8O2BuI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"501 West Sixth Street","locality":"Lexington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"40508","phone":"(859) 705-0915","latitude":38.0595806,"longitude":-84.4917775,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-15 19:53:38","updateDate":"2019-06-05 14:40:34","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-11:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-11:00pm,mon-11:00am-11:00pm,tue-11:00am-11:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"INGxSk","name":"Hell or High Lager","nameDisplay":"Hell or High Lager","description":"With the heat of summer well upon us, we decided to brew a Pale Lager to honor the momentous achievement of brewing 3000 batches of beers.

Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels.
