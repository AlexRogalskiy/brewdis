Not far from the brewery, lying preserved on the floor of Rock Lake, are two effigy mounds - a Headless Man and a Turtle.  Legend tells us, as the Turtle can survive on both land and in water, its spirit helped guide the Headless Man into the afterlife.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"b6oU3L","name":"Urban Family Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Urban Family","description":"We are a family-run brewery located in the heart of Ballard, Seattle.","website":"http:\/\/www.urbanfamilybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b6oU3L\/upload_LuwXIo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:02:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"NUSO3P86QB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"bQ8Tb6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4441 26th Ave W Suite A","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98199","phone":"(206) 861-6769","website":"http:\/\/www.urbanfamilybrewing.com\/","latitude":47.6605583,"longitude":-122.3899516,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-01-27 18:20:15","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QdcZJg","name":"Heart of the Devil","nameDisplay":"Heart of the Devil","abv":"6.2","ibu":"59","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-11-11 01:19:24","updateDate":"2017-11-11 18:36:06","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

But don\u2019t let our country dwelling, nature-loving heritage fool you: we occasionally like to take a walk on the wild side.  My dad, Bob, has been creatively living for years, pushing the envelope, pursuing each unique business venture with grace, fortitude, and certainly persistence.  Cultivating the beautiful Michigan land, farming sweet raspberries & outstanding apples, starting and operating a tart cherry juice concentrate business were all on the list of the accomplishments, passions, and past times for my dad and mom, Marie.  Marie's essence has always been built purely on thinking outside the box.  She is an artist, entrepreneur, a super fit grandmother, and is the glue holding our family together.   \r\n\r\nWhen I returned from a sabbatical to Southeast Asia in 2014 after a career as an engineer, I returned with an idea, \u201cDad, let\u2019s make hard cider\u201d.  Yes, he thought I was crazy.  Maybe I am.  But why not?  I had a vision.  It all made sense.  Our family had all of the pieces of a puzzle that just needed to be put together.  Dad had grown and managed apple orchards for over 30 years plus he always dares to be different.  He taught us kids to do the same.  Mom & Dad had built successful tart cherry juice business they ran for years.  My brother Rob has a long standing successful career in sales and my sister-in-law Melissa creatively juggled cooking, crafts, and being a mother of three.  All of us were foodies and all of us were passionate about cider. \r\n\r\nWe are farmers, engineers, artists, and entrepreneurs.  Cider was it. \r\n\r\nAnd so, Painted Turtle Hard Cider was born. \r\n\r\nThe vision of Painted Turtle is this:  Be creative.  Move forward.  Take chances.  Live with no regret.  Dare to Drink Different. \r\n\r\nThe Painted Turtle is the Michigan state reptile, so it was fitting that this could represent our local handcrafted product.  But also, Michigan Painted Turtles are\u2026.fearless;  Kind of like our family.  We move forward no matter what life deals us.   This is how we want to live and how we want everyone to live. \r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy our Hard Cider.  It was hand crafted in small batches exclusively by our family using only quality Michigan apples and ingredients.  It was made simply in a classic English style using only the best local ingredients selected by us.  It's fermented slowly for great flavor.  However, be aware: it\u2019s different, it\u2019s unique, but trust me, you deserve to live on the edge.  It very well may be something a little different than what\u2019s out there and what you are used to; I admit that we just decided to design it that way. \r\n\r\nWe know this will be the best hard cider you\u2019ve ever had and we\u2019re not afraid to say it.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"pUzMgZ","name":"Santa Clara Valley Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Santa Clara Valley","description":"Our brewery and tap room are now open at:\r\n101 E.
