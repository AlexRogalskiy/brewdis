Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EHRB4SUDWI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

Along the way, we\u2019ve made lots of friends and drank our unfair share of good beer, all while trying to do good in our communities and do well as a craft brewery.","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","established":"1998","mailingListUrl":"info@uplandbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:53:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8TCB25H9G6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"esM0Nc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"350 West 11th Street","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812-336-2337","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","latitude":39.1732971,"longitude":-86.5368625,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2017-10-12 13:33:14","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"E3tJa3","name":"Westside Beer Bar","streetAddress":"4060 Profile Pkwy","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812.336.2337","latitude":39.172339,"longitude":-86.586343,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","updateDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-2:00pm-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qNc7jU","name":"Carmel Tap House","streetAddress":"820 E. 116th St.","locality":"Carmel","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46032","phone":"1.317.564.3400","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/locations\/carmel-tap-house\/","latitude":39.9568182,"longitude":-86.1431514,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:10:54","updateDate":"2016-03-01 19:30:44","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ShKvsv","name":"Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"4842 North College Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46205","phone":"1.317.602.3931","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm -

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"UgR74t","name":"Stillwater Artisanal Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Stillwater Artisanal Ales","description":"\"A sincere artist is not one who makes a faithful attempt to put on to canvas what is in front of him, but one who tries to create something which is, in itself, a living thing.\" -Sir William Dobell\r\n\r\nThe goal of Stillwater Artisanal is just that, living art.

The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
