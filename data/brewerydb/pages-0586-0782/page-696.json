To boost sales of his small business, the owner decided to serve dinner on the weekends. It was a great success - and the rest is restaurant history. What started as a weekend cookout has grown into the world's largest western steakhouse with seating for 1800 people inside and outside for 2000.\r\n\r\nPinnacle Peak Patio is renowned for its delicious mesquite broiled steaks, casual western atmosphere, and its \"NO NECKTIE POLICY.\" This \"no necktie\" tradition was started one night when a Phoenix executive came in for dinner. The original owner, wanting to keep the atmosphere in his restaurant casual, told the executive, \"Either you take that tie off, or I'll cut it off.\" The executive did not take heed and was appalled when the owner pulled out a butcher knife and promptly cut off the offending cravat.\r\n\r\nWanting to be recognized as a victim of this absurd policy, the executive demanded that his tie be prominently displayed for all to see. The necktie was stapled to the rafters along with a business card identifying its victim. Pinnacle Peak is very serious about its \"no necktie\" policy and has cut over a million ties from unsuspecting customers.","website":"http:\/\/pppatio.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_HLhzPx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_HLhzPx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_HLhzPx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_HLhzPx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_HLhzPx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5efIdI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10426 East Jomax Road","locality":"Scottsdale","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"85255","phone":"1-480-563-5133","latitude":33.7268223,"longitude":-111.8531069,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OQ47At","name":"Gunslinging Helles","nameDisplay":"Gunslinging Helles","description":"Gunslinging Helles is yet another German inspired beer for 2011, making this the fourth after our Gose, Offen Weisse, and year-round Engelberg Pilsener.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
