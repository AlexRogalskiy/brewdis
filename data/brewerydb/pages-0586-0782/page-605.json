A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"oyIUnO","name":"Hallertau Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Hallertau","description":"Beer breweries big and small are all touting purity and natural ingredients these days.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.

At the age of 13, Mariano emigrated from Italy to Windsor, Ontario, Canada. As a young man, after school Mariano worked at the Studebaker auto factory in order to supplement his preferred vocation of wine making. \r\n \r\nIn 1921 at age 26, Mariano founded Border City Wine Cellars, quickly changing the name to the Meconi Wine Company. Following the repeal of Prohibition in December of 1933, Mariano moved his flourishing wine making enterprise across the river to Detroit in 1934. 1936 was the year Meconi moved the family to its present location in Paw Paw, in order to be closer to the acclaimed Lake Michigan Shore grape-growing region. With the move came a new name, The Italian Wine Company. \r\n \r\nIn 1941, during World War II, Meconi strategically countered rising antifascist sentiment in the United States by switching the name of the company once again, from The Italian Wine Company, to St. Julian Winery. \r\n \r\nIn the last name change of the company, Mariano Meconi humbly paid homage to the patron saint of his native village, Faleria, Italy. All Italian villages have patron saints and San Giuliano, nee St. Julian, stands as the saint that protects the village and the citizens of Faleria. \r\n\r\nWith a rich history, St. Julian still produces some on the long-time favorites, including Sholom Kosher Wine and our award-winning Solera Cream Sherry. Over the past 15 years, St. Julian has focused on producing a new line of single varietal wines. The grapes come from the best vineyards in Southwest Michigan, producing top quality wines. In 1999, Braganini Reserve Meritage was \u201cborn\u201d establishing a small lot production of dry, single varietal wines. As excitement from the President and Winemaker grew, St. Julian now has over 15 Braganini Reserve wines ranging in many different winemaking styles. \r\n \r\nFor over 92 years, the Winery now known as St. Julian Wine Co., Inc. has produced award-winning products. From the first shoots of the Michigan spring through the harvest and barrel tasting of late fall, the family tradition that has flourished transforms grapes to wine, fruit to nectar, as passion and science converge bottle after bottle, case after case.","website":"http:\/\/www.stjulian.com\/","established":"1921","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s5IAhv\/upload_CzlJ39-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s5IAhv\/upload_CzlJ39-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s5IAhv\/upload_CzlJ39-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s5IAhv\/upload_CzlJ39-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s5IAhv\/upload_CzlJ39-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-27 15:37:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FZdqTC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"716 S.

As veterans and patriots, we find that we owe it to our patrons to only produce the finest beer made with the best ingredients with the same level of attention to detail and passion that we brought to serving our country.\r\n\r\n100% American sourced ingredients & Organic base malts\r\n\r\n92% Locally sourced or Organic ingredients\r\n\r\n1% Of every pint goes to charity\r\n\r\nORGANIC & SUSTAINABLE\r\n\r\nIt is worth the extra effort to pay a little more, make a little less and put a whole lot of elbow grease into things to make a better product. A better product that not only tastes great, but is also made in a responsible and sustainable way. We use 100% organic 2-Row in all of our beers and each of our beers is comprised of at least 90% organic ingredients. No genetic modification, no pesticides, no BS just great beer.\r\n\r\nREUSE, RECYCLE & REDUCE\r\n\r\nElbow grease is an understatement to how we built our brewery. We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?\r\n\r\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER?\r\n\r\nWe want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you. So the next time you have a pint of Heritage be sure to stop and think about all that is going into the beer in front of you.\r\n\r\nCome check out our taproom when your in northern Virginia or grab one of our beers on tap or in stores.","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:34:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:12:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"B5K20TQZ47","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"UNp9ot","name":"Heritage Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"9436 Center Point Lane","locality":"Manassas","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20110","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","latitude":38.752225,"longitude":-77.4895437,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:35:22","updateDate":"2015-10-13 19:23:55","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NsdvJL","name":"Force of Nature","nameDisplay":"Force of Nature","description":"Balanced, with a lush maltiness, and massive, massive Zythos hop flavor.","abv":"8","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-09 11:13:32","updateDate":"2014-06-09 11:13:32","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

These are just a few of the reasons why we brew and bottle our beer in one of the greatest places on earth. This little town in Northern New South Wales has influenced everything we do at Stone & Wood.\r\n\r\nNot only has it helped shape our philosophy of trying to take things slowly and keeping it simple, but the natural beauty, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and the laid back vibe were the inspiration for our beers.\r\n\r\n\u2018Byron\u2019 is a destination for visitors from around the world and we\u2019re always grateful we get to call the place home.","website":"http:\/\/stoneandwood.com.au","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buuCTR\/upload_eHfE6w-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buuCTR\/upload_eHfE6w-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buuCTR\/upload_eHfE6w-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buuCTR\/upload_eHfE6w-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/buuCTR\/upload_eHfE6w-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-07 05:22:22","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kloFvq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4 Boronia Place","locality":"Byron Bay","region":"New South Wales","postalCode":"2481","phone":"+61 2 6685 5173","website":"http:\/\/www.stoneandwood.com.au","latitude":-28.6344333,"longitude":153.585656,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-08 16:03:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mv7m2h","name":"Foreign Export Stout","nameDisplay":"Foreign Export Stout","description":"Coffee, caramel leading to dry roasted bitterness.

Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Bitterness may be high but the perception is often compromised by malt sweetness. Hop aroma and flavor should not be perceived. The perception of fruity esters is low. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"60","abvMin":"5.7","abvMax":"9.3","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.052","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:23:58"},"breweries":[{"id":"VjnZAd","name":"Upslope Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upslope","description":"Located in Boulder with two tap rooms (Flatiron Park & Lee Hill), Upslope taps into Colorado's active lifestyle by offering superior quality, hand-crafted ales & lagers in cans for the on-the-go beer enthusiast.\r\n\r\nAscend to New Heights.","website":"http:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/#","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2019-07-20 13:02:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"09JBTMX3RW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"89FEzM","name":"Lee Hill","streetAddress":"1501 Lee Hill Road No. 20","locality":"Boulder","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80304","phone":"720-379-7528","website":"http:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/","latitude":40.0628561,"longitude":-105.2791958,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-03-08 13:42:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-8:00pm,tue-2:00pm-8:00pm,wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-2:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ha3HrR","name":"Flatiron Park","streetAddress":"1898 S.
