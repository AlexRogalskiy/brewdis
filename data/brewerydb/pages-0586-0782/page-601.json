Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:22:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5NJLHA2D94","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VYXVzs","name":"Flying Dutchess","nameDisplay":"Flying Dutchess","abv":"6","styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-13 18:32:06","updateDate":"2015-01-13 18:47:07","style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content. Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"GiUuhB","name":"People's Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"People's","description":"People make our beer great.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EHRB4SUDWI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"qpIAF8","name":"Blackrocks Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Blackrocks","description":"Brewing beer in Marquette, Michigan and having a blast doing it!\r\n\r\nWe love beer.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-12-14 21:09:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JS9DRET054","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JnVaX2","name":"Flying Unicorn Crotch Kick","nameDisplay":"Flying Unicorn Crotch Kick","description":"What started off as an inside joke about the manliness of unicorns, turned into one amazing beer!
