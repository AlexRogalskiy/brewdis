A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"BCPuYp","name":"Fat Head's Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Fat Head's","description":"Full-scale production brewery offering award-winning beers on tap, tasty grub, guided tours and live entertainment.","website":"http:\/\/www.fatheads.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:54:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ST92BCAJQ8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"M5VpZt","name":"Cleveland","streetAddress":"24581 Lorain Rd","locality":"North Olmsted","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44070","phone":"(440) 801-1001","website":"http:\/\/fatheads.com\/","latitude":41.426338,"longitude":-81.8942255,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-06-11 14:39:45","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dh7I4h","name":"Saloon","streetAddress":"1805 E Carson St","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15203","phone":"(412) 431-7433","website":"http:\/\/www.fatheadspittsburgh.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon -

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"Au2Cps","name":"Saints Row Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Saints Row","description":"Saints Row is a family-owned and operated nanobrewery just outside of downtown Rockville.
