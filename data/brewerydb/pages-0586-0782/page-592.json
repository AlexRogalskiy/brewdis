This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"ToWOJj","name":"8 Wired Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"8 Wired","description":"A microbrewing company based in Marlborough, New Zealand.\r\n\r\nTo produce mindblowing beers that will wow craftbeer lovers, excite fellow beer geeks and educate the mis-guided who still believe that","website":"http:\/\/www.8wired.co.nz\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ToWOJj\/upload_ouL1tE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ToWOJj\/upload_ouL1tE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ToWOJj\/upload_ouL1tE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ToWOJj\/upload_ouL1tE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ToWOJj\/upload_ouL1tE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"pdLPeS","name":"Main Brewery","extendedAddress":"PO Box 1184","locality":"Blenheim","postalCode":"7201","phone":"(21) 0329162","website":"http:\/\/www.8wired.co.nz\/","latitude":-41.5134425,"longitude":173.9612498,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-11-20 17:59:51","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9Ylplt","name":"Fistful of Hops","nameDisplay":"Fistful of Hops","abv":"6.2","availableId":2,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9Ylplt\/upload_kQ1OVq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9Ylplt\/upload_kQ1OVq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9Ylplt\/upload_kQ1OVq-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9Ylplt\/upload_kQ1OVq-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9Ylplt\/upload_kQ1OVq-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9Ylplt\/upload_kQ1OVq-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-05 11:47:55","updateDate":"2017-08-30 16:51:21","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home brew around that time and would share his batches with the Goulets and their friends. What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

Their primary goal is to serve the immediate local market with fresh flavoursome beer.\r\n\r\nThe brewery has been a long time in the making, stemming from a long passion for beer and many years of home brewing. Fitzy started out brewing his first beer back in 1987 as a 16 year old. It was a Muntons \u2013 English Mild that seeded the journey many moons ago\u2026 in an era where good ingredients and quality information were very hard to obtain \u2013 oh how different it is today.\r\n\r\nHaving become lost in the wilderness for several years, the passion for great beer and brewing was rekindled when working with some like minded individuals circa 2001 at Unisys in Wellington. They would knock off at 4.30pm and have regular Friday afternoon beer tasting sessions, blind critiquing whatever was brought in, including their own special brews. Needless to say there was a great deal of heated discussion regarding the qualities or faults of each particular beer.\r\n\r\nThe passion for great tasting beer grew to such an extent that when the Fitzpatrick family moved to Tauranga in 2003, a \u201cbrewery space\u201d was added to the new shed plans, for that \u2018one day dream\u2019. Ten years later, with the help of wife Catherine, that dream is a reality.","website":"http:\/\/fitzpatricksbrewing.co.nz","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:45:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MhuHRk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"19 Keenan Road","locality":"Pyes PA","region":"Tauranga","postalCode":"3173","phone":"037-648-5650","latitude":-37.7742129,"longitude":176.1140377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:48:40","updateDate":"2018-07-18 17:50:15","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"i4LDz4","name":"Fitzy\u2019s Stout","nameDisplay":"Fitzy\u2019s Stout","description":"A dry Irish Stout named for bike shop owner Scott Fiztgerald.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Just great hand-crafted beer brewed in West London with the best ingredients, knowledge, and respect for process, and a little insanity.\r\n\r\nBut why stop there? We don\u2019t believe in being stereotyped. We love upfront in-your-face hop focused beers, but are we only going to brew these? Hell no! We love beer, and we will brew whatever we want, whenever it suits us.\r\n\r\nAt Weird Beard we aim to continue making experimental, no-holds-barred beers that we feel excited about and we want to drink.\r\n\r\nInspired by the American and burgeoning British craft beer movement, along with great music, exquisite food, epic beards, and the outstanding beer community in our hometown of London, Weird Beard Brew Co will not compromise on anything to bring the best flavours to the beer, whether it is the roasted specialty grains in a stout or the newest hops in an IPA. We create beers that push the boundaries of style, forcing the consumer to stop and think about the drink in front of them, to confront the misconceptions of what ale and beer should or can be, and who drinks it? \r\n\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, Gregg and Bryan do sport some very impressive facial hair. Here at Weird Beard Brew Co we are all about the beards, but not so much the sandals. We are passionate about good beer, no matter where it comes from or how it is dispensed. You will find us in bottle shops, on cask in real ale pubs and in the best London beer bars on keg.\r\n\r\nWeird Beard Brew Co is a full on, no compromise brewery, brewing great tasting and genre-busting beers...hold on to your taste buds and come along for the ride!","website":"http:\/\/www.weirdbeardbrewco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 17:37:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"p0vg5z","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Boston Business Park","extendedAddress":"Unit 5","locality":"Hanwell","region":"London","postalCode":"W72QA","phone":"0203 645 2711","latitude":51.5000484,"longitude":-0.338234,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 17:59:01","updateDate":"2014-11-10 17:59:01","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
