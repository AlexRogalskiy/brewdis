Piloncillo Brown Ale","description":"This is our take on the American Brown Ale style, with a twist. This balanced Brown ale utilizes unrefined Mexican Piloncillo Sugar in the boil to add to the aroma, flavor, and body of the finished product. This is a full bodied, malt forward beer with strong notes of Caramel, Brown Sugar, Molasses, Chocolate, and Toffee. Traditional English hops like East Kent Golding are used to add just enough bitterness to balance out the malt sweetness. Hop Heads need not apply.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"22","glasswareId":8,"srmId":23,"availableId":1,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2014-09-10 18:40:50","updateDate":"2014-09-10 20:41:44","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":23,"name":"23","hex":"882300"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
