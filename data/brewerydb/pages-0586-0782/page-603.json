Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Since then, we\u2019ve proudly brewed all our beers here, crafting balanced and flavorful ales and lagers for thousands of happy locals and visitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year, hundreds of our beers can be found throughout the South Jersey and Philadelphia areas. We are proud to self-distribute our beers to hundreds of bars, restaurants, and liquor stores, ensuring premium freshness and excellent service. While the majority of our beers are only available on draft, we bottle several of our flagship brews as well as our recent, highly-acclaimed Barrel Aged Series.\r\n\r\nOur Tasting Room is the largest and most accessible in the state, with a spacious and sunny Beer Garden.

We aim to create elegant ales that are experimental and unique, balanced with complex flavors and aromas. From the recipes to the artwork on the labels, everything is designed by ourselves and our good friends.\r\n\r\nGypsy brewing means we are brewers without a permanent brewing home. We travel to other breweries, use their equipment to make something special, and bring the results back home to share. Think of Grimm Ales as a band, and the host brewery as a recording studio. We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).\r\n\r\nEach batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!\r\n\r\nExpect our first beers to pop up in New York in summer 2013. Some of our first batches might be a crisp, spicy rye abbey ale, a rich, golden Belgian tripel, and a hop-focused pale ale made with clean, slightly acidic champagne yeast.","website":"http:\/\/grimmales.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 13:04:26","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:12:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U8CLHEZ0RV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TIn5vy","name":"Main Office","extendedAddress":"PO Box 150472","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11215","phone":"(678) 895-1489","website":"http:\/\/grimmales.com\/","latitude":40.6681669,"longitude":-73.9800645,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 13:05:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TAa9kg","name":"Foo Town","nameDisplay":"Foo Town","description":"Foo Town is a smashable, 4% Aussie lager, with a touch of wheat.
