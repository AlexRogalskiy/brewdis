Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

If you come across our beer on tap, or in bottles at your local retailer, rest assured that we poured our passion for beer into every ounce.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackrabbitbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 16:14:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:49:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7YAUXLODRQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"tdu8Qi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1323 Terminal St.","locality":"West Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95691","latitude":38.5718525,"longitude":-121.5413488,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","updateDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-5:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"t0WpMp","name":"Grey Ghost IPA","nameDisplay":"Grey Ghost IPA","description":"Powerful American hopped IPA with citrus and grapefruit flavours.

The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ey972v","name":"Griffith J Griffith","nameDisplay":"Griffith J Griffith","description":"Imperial Stout with Ethiopian Yirga Cheffe Kore Kochore coffee from Trystero.

Overall, Highland Park Brewery has a fairly simple goal of making excellent beer and having a good time along the journey.","website":"http:\/\/www.thehermosillo.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 14:05:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:57:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"74UFX06QSE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"noV8kb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5125 York Blvd","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90042","phone":"(323) 739-6459","latitude":34.1211667,"longitude":-118.2037952,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 14:05:08","updateDate":"2015-11-18 21:19:31","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gTXILA","name":"Griffon Ale Rousse","nameDisplay":"Griffon Ale Rousse","abv":"4.5","ibu":"25","srmId":17,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2015-04-20 15:47:44","updateDate":"2015-04-20 16:33:22","srm":{"id":17,"name":"17","hex":"B04500"},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
