If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"21","abvMin":"5.6","abvMax":"8.6","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"hpK1X5","name":"O'so Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"O'so","description":"3028 Village Park Dr. Plover WI\r\n\r\nArtisan brewery specializing in barrel aged sour beers and all things incredibly hoppy","website":"http:\/\/www.osobrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:23:32","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4TGPEFX23J","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ILdv2n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3028 Village Park Drive","locality":"Plover","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54467","phone":"715-254-2163","website":"http:\/\/www.osobrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday -Saturday 9:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m.\r\nSunday 10 a.m. - 4 p.m.","latitude":44.452355,"longitude":-89.523162,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday -Saturday 9:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m.\r\nSunday 10 a.m. - 4 p.m.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"VVErmk","name":"Funk Factory Geuzeria","nameShortDisplay":"Funk Factory","website":"http:\/\/www.funkfactorygeuzeria.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-03 17:28:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:40:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2T5N3LR1C0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"jdQySZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1604 Gilson St.","locality":"Madison","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53715","latitude":43.049881,"longitude":-89.3920016,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-03 17:29:03","updateDate":"2015-09-03 17:29:03","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"E8LDSQ","name":"Franboise","nameDisplay":"Franboise","description":"A great raspberry hit leaves an incredible but not overpowering tartness on the palate.","abv":"3.6","styleId":66,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-09 17:01:39","updateDate":"2017-06-09 17:01:39","style":{"id":66,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Lambic","shortName":"Lambic","description":"Unblended, naturally and spontaneously fermented lambic is intensely estery, sour, and sometimes, but not necessarily, acetic flavored.

These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners.
