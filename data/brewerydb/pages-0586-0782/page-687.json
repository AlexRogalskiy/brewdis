Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Continuing the tradition of Michigan and Craft brewers before us, we will create unique hand crafted Ales and Lagers, that will challenge expectations and ideas of what great beer really is. With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.\r\n\r\nMade in Michigan and the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOne of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn\u2019t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s All About the Beer!\r\n\r\nWe are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried. We are also going to push the envelope and make beers with unique and far-out ingredients that will invite you to be different and maybe live a little on the edge. We already have over 20 recipes waiting for people to try and enjoy.","website":"http:\/\/www.fallingdownbeer.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"g3aigX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2270 East 10 Mile Road","locality":"Warren","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48091","phone":"586-799-BREW","website":"http:\/\/www.fallingdownbeer.com\/","latitude":42.4760128,"longitude":-83.0797993,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-05 11:54:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zN03Fl","name":"Green Tea IPA","nameDisplay":"Green Tea IPA","description":"Tawny-gold in color with wispy-white lacing, this IPA has a nose of sweet, pan-fired green tea that blends with an inviting hop aroma.

It is one of the last remaining authentic lambic breweries of Belgium and well known for its lambic beer brewed along traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nLambic matures up to three years in wooden barrels, whereupon it is blended to make Oude Geuze. Sour cherries undergo fermentation in lambic beer and after a second fermentation in the bottle Oude Kriek is born. This unique brewing process with spontaneous fermentation is possible in Belgium in the Pajottenland region, the Zenne Valley and in Brussels, because of the presence of a specific microflora.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of succession in the family business at the end of 2002, the traditional lambic beers of Oud Beersel were threatened to disappear. Shocked by the loss of this cultural and historical patrimony, the brewery was taken over in 2005 and business was restarted pursuing the principal aim to protect the time-honoured lambic beers, as well as the cultural and historical heritage of Oud Beersel for the coming generations.\r\n\r\nThis traditional brewery of lambic beers is nowadays managed in a modern way with respect for tradition and the m\u00e9tier. The traditional part of the production process of the lambic beers, in particular the spontaneous fermentation, the maturation of lambic in wooden barrels and the mixture of various lambic casks and vintages constitutes the core business of the company. The production process is completed in close collaboration with excellent partners who manage the industrial equipment. By the synergy between the m\u00e9tier and the industry, Oud Beersel offers authentic products of the highest quality.\r\n\r\nThanks to the success of the special Bersalis beers, i.e. the high fermentation beers of Oud Beersel, investments are continuously made to optimize the production process, to achieve the most demanding quality standards and to extend the infrastructure for the time-honoured lambic beers of Oud Beersel in order to meet the always growing demand.","website":"http:\/\/www.oudbeersel.com\/","established":"1882","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EFaa8I\/upload_ICWtsd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"6xIUOg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Laarheiestraat 230","locality":"Beersel","region":"Vlaams Brabant","latitude":50.7599724,"longitude":4.3047963,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"twdumh","name":"Green with Envy","nameDisplay":"Green with Envy","description":"Wavelengths of hazy Cashmere, Wakatu, Cascade, and Denali hops pass through through a supple malt prism to create a chromatic dispersion of flavor and aromas that harmonize with the colorful fabric of NOLA.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

We can't wait to share our beer with Charlotte and beyond and look forward welcoming everyone to our spacious tap room very soon.","website":"http:\/\/triplecbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:30:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:30:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TC5H0XLUBR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Qfcr4y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2900 Griffith St.","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28203","phone":"704-372-3212","website":"http:\/\/www.triplecbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"MONDAY - closed \r\nTUESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nTHURSDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nFRIDAY 4 - 9 pm\r\nSATURDAY 2 - 9 pm\r\nSUNDAY 1 - 6 pm","latitude":35.200972,"longitude":-80.869119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:32:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"MONDAY - closed \r\nTUESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nTHURSDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nFRIDAY 4 - 9 pm\r\nSATURDAY 2 - 9 pm\r\nSUNDAY 1 - 6 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0aDldM","name":"Greenwood Beach Blonde","nameDisplay":"Greenwood Beach Blonde","abv":"4","glasswareId":5,"availableId":6,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0aDldM\/upload_cgZh9U-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0aDldM\/upload_cgZh9U-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0aDldM\/upload_cgZh9U-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0aDldM\/upload_cgZh9U-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0aDldM\/upload_cgZh9U-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/0aDldM\/upload_cgZh9U-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-27 14:47:23","updateDate":"2015-12-17 13:49:10","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
