There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"DWjwcm","name":"Rivertown Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Rivertown","description":"Welcome to the Rivertown Brewing Company, We specialize in brewing traditional Handcrafted Lagers and Ales, using only the finest and freshest ingredients available.  use the buttons to the left to find out \"What Ales You\"!","website":"http:\/\/rivertownbrewery.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:54:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DX8G13SKPL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eKF3uv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"607 Shepherd Drive #6","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45215","phone":"513-827-9280","website":"http:\/\/rivertownbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:        4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu:         5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\t5:00 pm -10:00 pm\r\nSat:\t2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":39.236015,"longitude":-84.462885,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:        4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu:         5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\t5:00 pm -10:00 pm\r\nSat:\t2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mK9OkM","name":"Hop Box","nameDisplay":"Hop Box","description":"Hop Box is our tribute to Hops!

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.
