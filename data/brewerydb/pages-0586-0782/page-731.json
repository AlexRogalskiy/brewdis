For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"wox4DM","name":"Hofgut Dom\u00e4ne Hechingen","nameShortDisplay":"Hofgut Dom\u00e4ne Hechingen","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"LRCEhC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Brielhof 1","locality":"Hechingen","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","postalCode":"D-72379","latitude":48.33589,"longitude":8.95009,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:24","updateDate":"2017-08-28 14:37:23","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zNWPNh","name":"Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Hefeweizen","description":"\u201cHefe\u201d means yeast, and \u201cWeizen\u201d means wheat, so Hefeweizen is \u201cyeast wheat.\u201d  Perfect as a session beer\u2026definitely a must have if your a fan of German style brewing.","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-21 19:04:17","updateDate":"2015-10-21 19:04:17","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Located at the corner of Broadway and Ottawa Streets it is the oldest working commercial building in Toledo. Our Brew Masters bring excellence in brewing and culinary experience to our craft beers. We transfer the same strength, creativeness, size, uniqueness and complexity of the architecture of the Oliver House to the artistry of our craft beer. No other brewery in the country brews under such history. With additional holding tanks and a bottling line located directly across the street at 28 Broadway, MBBCo's process requires great attention to detail and is very labor intensive. This delicate care sets our final product apart from other mass-produced brewing competitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year we have 7 beers on tap at the Maumee Bay Brew Pub, including the historical Buckeye Beer. Additionally, our beers are available at all of the restaurants in the historic Oliver House. Come enjoy our craft beer paired with Toledo's best steak at Rockwell's or enjoy a pint with a pizza baked in our wood oven at the Pub. Enjoy a brewer's sample and some classic gaming at Mutz. It's simply a great place to be - in a whole lot of old and new ways!

Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"EkaYXg","name":"Three Mile Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Three Mile","description":"Three Mile Brewing is driven to create quality craft beers for Davis and the surrounding area.","website":"http:\/\/www.threemilebrewing.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EkaYXg\/upload_AGlYo7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EkaYXg\/upload_AGlYo7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EkaYXg\/upload_AGlYo7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EkaYXg\/upload_AGlYo7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EkaYXg\/upload_AGlYo7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-25 21:21:56","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:02:12","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LYVPHKNW2Z","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"ccnGTX","name":"Three Mile Brewing","streetAddress":"231 G St","extendedAddress":"Ste 2 & 3","locality":"Davis","region":"California","postalCode":"95616","phone":"(530) 564-4351","website":"http:\/\/www.threemilebrewing.com\/","latitude":38.5449252,"longitude":-121.739247,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-25 21:21:57","updateDate":"2016-08-22 19:08:08","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-8:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"e40kjr","name":"Three Mile Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"231 G St","extendedAddress":"Ste 4","locality":"Davis","region":"Ca","phone":"5305644351","website":"http:\/\/www.threemilebrewing.com","latitude":38.5445193,"longitude":-121.7395792,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-08-01 05:02:35","updateDate":"2016-08-22 19:08:20","forwardingId":"ccnGTX","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bQMj89","name":"Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Hefeweizen","description":"This summer favorite is brewed in the German style with imported German Wheat, Pilsner Malt and lightly hopped.
