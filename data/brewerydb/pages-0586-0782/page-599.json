So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Since opening in 1989, CBC has been the destination for diners with adventurous palates and a thirst for both authentic flavors and unique interpretations of classic beer styles. To satisfy these appetites, CBC\u2019s brewmaster and chef routinely collaborate on investigating beer-food pairings and ways in which beer\u2014even brewing ingredients\u2014can transform traditional dishes and inspire new ones. This eagerness to ask ourselves \u201cwhat if?\u201d has earned us a slew of accolades, a shelf full of awards and devoted customers who are always eager to try what CBC comes up with next.","website":"https:\/\/www.cambridgebrewingcompany.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2019-07-11 17:56:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HLIPT1ZMKW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EB3XVT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Kendall Square","extendedAddress":"Bldg 100","locality":"Cambridge","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02139","phone":"(617) 494-1994","website":"http:\/\/www.cambrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri: 11:30 am - 1:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":42.366468,"longitude":-71.0914549,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri: 11:30 am - 1:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9n4zw7","name":"Flower Child","nameDisplay":"Flower Child","description":"Pipeworks Flower Child is the groovy, free-spirited sister to the previous generations of berliner beauties.
