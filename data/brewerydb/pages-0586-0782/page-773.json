A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"QUtA29","name":"MobCraft Beer","nameShortDisplay":"MobCraft Beer","description":"At our Milwaukee taproom we offer our flagships, crowdsourced beers and a variety of taproom only releases.

All we have to say is that there is a whole lot of creativity in those vats of beer just dying to come out, and we never stop till we get it right.","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:20:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JPLOVRX46D","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"V8LP7a","name":"Bel Air","streetAddress":"16 A Bel Air South Parkway","locality":"Bel Air","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21015","phone":"410-515-3222","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","latitude":39.4976844,"longitude":-76.3312187,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2017-05-08 18:55:15","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"n2527g","name":"Arundel Mills","streetAddress":"7000 Arundel Mills Circle","extendedAddress":"Suite R4","locality":"Hanover","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21076","phone":"410-799-1166","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun & Mon:\r\nDining Room: 11:00am -

The oats not only add an unexpected sweetness, but also a heavier mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been developing the recipe for this I.P.A. for over two years now. Every time I brew this beer I get excited for the spicy, citrus aroma thats released when the hops are added to the brew kettle. It\u2019s almost overwhelming since there are around a pound and a half of hops per barrel. To round out all that hoppiness we use oats in the mash, it adds a little bit of sweetness but also creates a little bit of a heavier mouthfeel. Since there is so much interplay between the hops and the malt we didn\u2019t want any of it to get muddled up with the yeast and fermentation process so we went with a standard yeast strain on this brew. If you\u2019re looking to pair this beer up with something to eat, I recommend something on the spicier side.","abv":"7.7","ibu":"51","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KujcL4\/upload_Dy5Im7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KujcL4\/upload_Dy5Im7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KujcL4\/upload_Dy5Im7-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KujcL4\/upload_Dy5Im7-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KujcL4\/upload_Dy5Im7-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KujcL4\/upload_Dy5Im7-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.075","createDate":"2012-09-09 13:20:07","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:10:38","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character.

After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

These more delicate styles take incredible skill to brew well as there\u2019s nowhere to hide any miscalculations or mistakes throughout production. Launching to the almost extreme opposite, the realm of IIPAs, balance, surprisingly, is still a defining factor. Instead of delicacy in balance, it\u2019s now big flavour in balance. Simplistically, to achieve a big flavourful IIPA you need: Big Malt + Big Hops + Big Fermentation. It\u2019s a bit of complicated symbiosis between these three requirements and each of these three provide multiple elements. The malt provides the complex spectrum of sugars for fermentation as well as the main structure and body of the beer. The hops contribute bitterness to balance the malt sweetness as well as resinous piney flavours and juicy fruity-citrusy aromas. The fermentation provides us with a big hit of fun juice (ethanol) and the vast array of incredibly important characterful aroma and flavour compounds. Not sure if that was too far off track, anyway, what you needed to take away from that was: Pirate Life IIPA is a big beer with big delicious fresh flavours that we hope you will enjoy by sticking it in your big mouth.

Grinding it out everyday for a fee, wearing suits and kissing butt.\r\n\r\nThen this brewery chose us...she forced us to ask ourselves, \"Is this desk job really how I pictured my life?\"  We answered that questions by taking over River Horse in 2007 and have not looked back.  We may not end up as the greatest success story on earth, but at least we had the balls to try.  Sometimes, for better or worse, your dreams get the best of you.\r\n\r\nJust remember, it's a big world out there and cubicles don't have doors, so you can walk out anytime.
