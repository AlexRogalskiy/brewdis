A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Bentel lived at the northeast corner of Brewery and Grainery streets, where his house remains today, as upright as when Indiana's first brewer marched out to make his beer almost two centuries ago.\r\nThe German utopian communalists in New Harmony were Indiana's first significant brewers. Beginning in 1816, the Harmonists eventually brewed enough to sell all the way up to what is now West Virginia and down into lower Illinois. From the historical record, it appears the Harmonists brewed a porter-like dark beer.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness.

With micro-floral creatures such as Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Brettanomyces, it is the brewer\u2019s job to get these wild microorganisms to create flavors that are tart and crisp, tropical and wild, and downright funky. It is the ultimate way to truly express a sense of place in our beers, to create beers that form with you a lasting experience, that have the effect of taking you to our brewery, taproom and venue with every sip. At the end of the day, here in the brewery, it is all about our microscopic wild friends.","website":"http:\/\/www.artifactbeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 19:28:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:20:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PHUCQ9DFMY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hSB1eG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1660 Blue Rock St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45223","latitude":39.1604192,"longitude":-84.5423262,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-26 17:29:26","updateDate":"2015-05-26 17:31:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"1:30am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"1:30am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-12:00am,tue-4:00pm-12:00am,wed-4:00pm-12:00am,thu-4:00pm-12:00am,fri-4:00pm-1:30am,sat-12:00pm-1:30am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","tourInfo":"The brewers will be giving free tours through the brewery every Saturday and Sunday at 1:00pm and 3:00pm each day.
