The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"yyXPEU","name":"Side Project Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Side Project","description":"A 100% barrel-aged, mostly barrel fermented, gypsy brewing project.","website":"http:\/\/sideprojectbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-26 17:14:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:51:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"E5JN6IWK1C","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ymbt9C","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7458 Manchester Rd","locality":"Maplewood","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63143","website":"http:\/\/www.sideprojectbrewing.com","latitude":38.61188,"longitude":-90.321888,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-27 01:21:32","updateDate":"2017-12-11 18:41:56","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"TYlrtN","name":"Side Project Cellar","streetAddress":"7373 Marietta Ave","locality":"Maplewood","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63143","phone":"(314) 224-5211","website":"http:\/\/www.sideprojectbrewing.com\/tasting-room\/","latitude":38.611977,"longitude":-90.3198394,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-21 13:54:27","updateDate":"2015-07-21 13:54:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-3:00pm-10:00pm,wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-1:00pm-11:00pm,sat-1:00pm-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WR7hfZ","name":"Fuzzy Baby Ducks","nameDisplay":"Fuzzy Baby Ducks","description":"Yup... we're the ones who make this.

But his obvious passion for the brewing craft led him to the title assistant brewer and eventually head brewer in short three years. At that time he joined forces with former NHB colleague Blair Potts to run Quality Assured Brewing, a consulting service for microbreweries throughout the North East. 1996 saw Rob as the Brew Master for both the Manchester and Westport, CT locations in The John Harvard\u2019s Brew House chain. While there, Rob won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the German Altbier category. Southern Connecticut, especially Norwalk, took a liking to Rob and that was where he became the brewmaster and operations manager for New England Brewing. He learned the sales end of beer and when the owners wanted to get out of the brewery business, Rob immediately took the opportunity to acquire the name of the company and re-locate the whole business just down the street from the kitchen where he first started making beer.","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:35:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RJDXIHMVAT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jzO9Iv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7 Selden St","locality":"Woodbridge","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06525","phone":"203-387-2222","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.3389393,"longitude":-72.9816961,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"a5kXI5","name":"Fuzzy Bear","nameDisplay":"Fuzzy Bear","description":"Brewed with honey, peaches and pears.

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:49:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZVWX7SOR0P","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HtFqFO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"831 W Bonanza Rd","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89106","phone":"702-362-7335","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","latitude":36.176722,"longitude":-115.15317,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:35:55","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"T1bDFU","name":"Fuzzy Wuzzy","nameDisplay":"Fuzzy Wuzzy","description":"Fuzzy Wuzzy was a beer, Fuzzy Wuzzy was not\r\nclear.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
