Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Chocolate or roast malts can be used, but the percentage used should be minimal. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Ale-like fruity esters and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"16","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:37:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"2UZwM4","name":"Jasper Ridge Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jasper Ridge","description":"Established in 1996, the Jasper Ridge Brewery produces  beer made from all natural ingredients such as malts, hops, yeast, and water and creates beer that is bursting with individual flavor, color, and aroma.

At that time this hobby was quite unique. Jay knew then he would someday like to own a brewery and bring the beer industry back to Holyoke. In 1995 this dream came true. Jay, at this time, owned an old manufacturing warehouse on Cabot Street in Holyoke. He soon incorporated the Paper City Brewery, Co., Inc. From here the wheels were in motion, Jay spent most of his time in transforming the fifth floor of the warehouse into a functional, federally and state approved, micro-brewery. Under the supervision of head brewer Rick Quackenbush the brewery put out its first brew of Holyoke Dam Ale in November of 1996.\r\n\r\nToday, Paper City Brewery continues to grow with the addition of a new Head Brewer Ben Anhalt, Assistant Brewer, Jason Todd and an additional flagship beer, Ireland Parish Golden Ale.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"cjEAQa","name":"Field Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Field","description":"Brewpub Restaurant","website":"http:\/\/www.fieldbrewing.com","established":"2018","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cjEAQa\/upload_yamYoe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cjEAQa\/upload_yamYoe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cjEAQa\/upload_yamYoe-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cjEAQa\/upload_yamYoe-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cjEAQa\/upload_yamYoe-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-18 18:03:00","updateDate":"2019-06-23 19:09:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DVT0YEZQWF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"817RYW","name":"Field Brewing","streetAddress":"303 East Main Street","locality":"Westfield","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46074","phone":"5133041776","website":"https:\/\/www.fieldbrewing.com\/","latitude":40.0425583,"longitude":-86.1247725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-18 18:05:40","updateDate":"2019-06-19 14:29:55","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm,mon-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-11:00am-9:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jf09og","name":"Home From Home","nameDisplay":"Home From Home","description":"We originally brewed this beer at Reuben\u2019s in Seattle last year, it was such a success that we couldn\u2019t wait for Adam to come over and brew a UK version with us!
