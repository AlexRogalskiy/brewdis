If a more relaxing day is preferred, people can enjoy fishing, hiking, camping, sailing, antiquing, and bird watching or simply kicking back and taking in the spectacular views of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.","website":"http:\/\/www.kernriverbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:11:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PR104CN983","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"sIBGId","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"13415 Sierra Highway","locality":"Kernville","region":"California","postalCode":"93238","phone":"760-376-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.kernriverbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":35.757512,"longitude":-118.419213,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"y62THY","name":"Gravity Hill","nameDisplay":"Gravity Hill","description":"Gravity Hill is a full bodied tripel that mixes notes of clove, banana, and vanilla.

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused.

Thanks to this crazy new bar in Winnetka, CA and our buddy the bartender, we were introduced to new styles of beer that were much different than the commercial brands we were used to. After many conversations on the process of making beer and the brewing techniques of smaller breweries, we decided to take a chance at brewing our own malted, adult beverages! \r\n\r\nWe signed up for a Maltose Falcons class, bought a brewing kit and a turkey fryer and made a batch of beer on June 23, 2012. After this first batch, we were hooked! We invested more time in learning about the process, fabricated custom brewing equipment and experimented with new recipes while tweaking them to make them our own. \r\n\r\nAfter serving samples of our homemade brews and getting positive feedback, we began talking of doing it legit and opening up a brewery!  Given our Valley roots and the fact our beer was brewed out of a garage in Sylmar, CA, we decided 818 Brewing was the perfect name and we filed our paperwork in October 2014 for our new venture.\r\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ve enjoyed the most along our journey is the sense of community within the craft brew scene. Not many products can bring together men and women of different nationalities, age groups, religious beliefs, income levels, political views \u2013 and even fellow brewers! \u2013 And create a moment of common ground.  8 one 8 Brewing is proud to offer a product that brings us together to say cheers!","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home\/?age-verified=cd0a2fef44","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUEpGY\/upload_2tCAfE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:30:46","updateDate":"2019-07-02 19:08:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AH21G7RNY4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"GTwDJI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8951 De Soto Ave.","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-23 20:31:54","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\r\nTuesday  Closed\r\nWednesday  Closed\r\nThursday  5pm-12am\r\nFriday  5pm-12am\r\nSaturday  12pm-12am\r\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"73xdsm","name":"8one8 brewery","streetAddress":"8951 de soto ave","locality":"Canoga Park","region":"California","postalCode":"91304","phone":"(818) 835-2286","website":"http:\/\/818brewing.com\/home","hoursOfOperation":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","latitude":34.2334272,"longitude":-118.5889279,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-08-09 23:43:32","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:07:44","forwardingId":"GTwDJI","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday  Closed\nTuesday  Closed\nWednesday  Closed\nThursday  5pm-12am\nFriday  5pm-12am\nSaturday  12pm-12am\nSunday  12pm-8pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QAVAXu","name":"Gravity of Smile","nameDisplay":"Gravity of Smile","description":"Gravity of Smile is a hazy double IPA dry-hopped massively with Citra lupulin, Rakau, and Lemondrop.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Z5KemR","name":"Bottle Logic Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Bottle Logic","description":"Bottle Logic's mission is to brew the highest quality craft beer available, without compromise.

This historical perspective is maintained at the tavern where commerce is held equal to community. Both being Rapid City natives, Karl Koth and Sam Papendick are the owners and brewers at Hay Camp Brewing Company. After graduating from Stevens High School, Karl moved to Minneapolis to earn a degree in Physics and Sam moved to Fort Collins to earn a degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering (interesting how both locations are craft beer meccas). After receiving their bachelors degrees, they were reacquainted when pursuing graduate degrees from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.\r\nOne evening at a local Rapid City ale house, they began talking about beer and homebrewing. Sam had a great garage and Karl had nearly 10 years brewing experience, so they began brewing beer in Sam's garage almost weekly. Equipment was accumulated, techniques were shared, and plenty of free beer was available for their friends. Karl was finishing his M.S. in Geological Engineering and Sam was in the middle of his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering when they decided to go legitimate. The LLC was formed in August 2012 and they entered the Student Governors Giant Vision Award contest, where they placed third, winning $2500.\r\nIt took nearly a year to find a suitable location, but they finally settled on an unused and beat up garage at the Fairmont Creamery (current location). After six months of renovation, the tavern opened January 1, 2014. The beginning was modest, with a 1.5 bbl brewehouse, a 42 gal Blichman fermenter, and two 1.5 bbl single walled fermenters, but their limited time and production complemented their limited overhead.\r\nKarl received his Masters degree and began working at the US Geological Survey and Sam was still finishing his PhD, so the beer was brewed on the weekends and Friday was the only open night. In August 2014, two additional 3 BBL jacketed fermenters were installed, essentially tripling their production capacity. In January 2015, Hay Camp opened on Thursday nights, where they collaborate with Black Hills Vinyl for live music and bingo.\r\nThe patio opened spring 2015, which expanded seating capacity and overall fun. Patrons could play corn hole, country bucket, or just soak up the nice summer sun. In July 2015, they ordered a new 3 BBL brewhouse and expect the delivery late fall.\r\nLong term, Hay Camp Brewing Company will remain true to it's Rapid City roots. The current plan is to move toward a 10 BBL production brewery and begin distributing to local drafts. Growth is iterative, however, so stay tuned for adaptation post perturbation.","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 14:51:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:59:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GNOBI3ZCS7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Za6Nem","name":"Hay Camp Brewing Co","streetAddress":"201 Main St","locality":"Rapid City","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57701","phone":"(970) 215 9859","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","latitude":44.079643,"longitude":-103.2200919,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-24 18:07:31","updateDate":"2015-11-20 15:50:05","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2TZnTQ","name":"Gravy Maevey's Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Gravy Maevey's Pilsner","abv":"5","styleId":106,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-08 18:41:55","updateDate":"2015-04-27 13:04:23","style":{"id":106,"categoryId":10,"category":{"id":10,"name":"International Styles","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"International-Style Pilsener","shortName":"International Pilsener","description":"International Pilseners are straw\/golden in color and are well attenuated.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"OLmblj","name":"Lift Bridge Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Lift Bridge","description":"Welcome to Lift Bridge Beer Company.
