Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"c5A6lY","name":"Omnipollo","nameShortDisplay":"Omnipollo","website":"http:\/\/www.omnipollo.com\/beer\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/c5A6lY\/upload_V3O7I2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/c5A6lY\/upload_V3O7I2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/c5A6lY\/upload_V3O7I2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/c5A6lY\/upload_V3O7I2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/c5A6lY\/upload_V3O7I2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-24 02:42:39","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"3WyowO","name":"Omnipollo AB","streetAddress":"Tj\u00e4rhovsgatan 6 116 21","region":"Stockholm","latitude":59.3155278,"longitude":18.0783302,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-24 13:53:13","updateDate":"2014-09-24 13:54:03","timezoneId":"Europe\/Stockholm","country":{"isoCode":"SE","name":"SWEDEN","displayName":"Sweden","isoThree":"SWE","numberCode":752,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5XjKEv","name":"Hilsenbeck\u2019s Brunnenbier naturtr\u00fcb","nameDisplay":"Hilsenbeck\u2019s Brunnenbier naturtr\u00fcb","abv":"5.1","styleId":56,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5XjKEv\/upload_e1d9Qk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5XjKEv\/upload_e1d9Qk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5XjKEv\/upload_e1d9Qk-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5XjKEv\/upload_e1d9Qk-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5XjKEv\/upload_e1d9Qk-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5XjKEv\/upload_e1d9Qk-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:02:21","updateDate":"2015-12-16 17:22:00","style":{"id":56,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Kellerbier (Cellar beer) or Zwickelbier - Ale","shortName":"Kellerbier","description":"These beers are unfiltered German-style Altbier and K\u00f6lsch.

The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. Head retention may not be optimal.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance.

For every landlord this means a longer shelf life than beer from conditioning tanks. And for the real ale people it means better, fresher tasting beer.\r\n\r\nVisitors are always welcome to the brewery shop for offsales - from two pints to a firkin for that special occasion, party or wedding.

Flavor components should b e subtle and complex, with no one ingredient dominating the others. Malt sweetness is light to mild. Corn, rice, or other grain or sugar adjuncts are often used. Hop bitterness, flavor and aroma are negligible to very light. Light fruity esters are acceptable. Chill haze and diacetyl should be absent.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"13","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:39:26"},"breweries":[{"id":"4UcPMq","name":"Warped Wing Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Warped Wing","description":"Dayton based craft brewery committed to brewing proprietary beer styles and warped interpretations of existing styles.","website":"http:\/\/www.warpedwing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"info@warpedwing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4UcPMq\/upload_gN3iiV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4UcPMq\/upload_gN3iiV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4UcPMq\/upload_gN3iiV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4UcPMq\/upload_gN3iiV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4UcPMq\/upload_gN3iiV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-04 02:22:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:04:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8VKC0ZD3EI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Iw8VaQ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"26 Wyandot Street","locality":"Dayton","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45402","phone":"(937) 222-7003","website":"http:\/\/www.warpedwing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.75973,"longitude":-84.185402,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-04 02:25:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed - Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HRTNIg","name":"Hippies Use the Side Door","nameDisplay":"Hippies Use the Side Door","description":"Golden pale ale with gentle aromas of lavender supported by a hint of honey sweetness.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"V5iDoz","name":"Riverwatch Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Riverwatch","description":"Augusta, Georgia's first craft brewery - the first production brewery since Prohibition.
