The beer\u2019s grain bill consists of only one grain, 6-row barley pilsner malt, sourced from Riverbend Malt House in Riverbend, NC. Riverbend\u2019s mission is to provide craft brewers with locally-farmed, artisan malts that bring depth and character to their passion, while greatly lessening the local industry\u2019s impact on the planet. Their 6-row is slightly undermodified and kilned at a lower temperature than other malts, producing a grassy, grainy flavor perfect for this Helles-style lager.","abv":"4.8","styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-10-03 15:00:36","updateDate":"2019-10-03 15:00:36","style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 22 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"COZL0NR6V3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","timezoneId":"America\/Anchorage","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":21,"name":"Calypso","category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:28"},{"id":22,"name":"Cascade","description":"Cascade was created in the United States as an open-pollinated cross between Fuggle and Serebrianker.

We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?\r\n\r\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER?\r\n\r\nWe want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you. So the next time you have a pint of Heritage be sure to stop and think about all that is going into the beer in front of you.\r\n\r\nCome check out our taproom when your in northern Virginia or grab one of our beers on tap or in stores.","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:34:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:12:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"B5K20TQZ47","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"UNp9ot","name":"Heritage Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"9436 Center Point Lane","locality":"Manassas","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20110","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","latitude":38.752225,"longitude":-77.4895437,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:35:22","updateDate":"2015-10-13 19:23:55","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VOk6lr","name":"Heritage Honey Ale","nameDisplay":"Heritage Honey Ale","styleId":126,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-22 22:58:33","updateDate":"2015-07-22 22:58:33","style":{"id":126,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Honey Lager or Ale","shortName":"Honey Beer","description":"These beers are brewed using honey in addition to malted barley.

Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.
