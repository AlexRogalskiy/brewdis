The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"dc6ShA","name":"Steam Theory Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Steam Theory","description":"We are an elevated craft experience with an on-site 15BBL brewery, farm to table kitchen and full bar.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"G0ISPa","name":"Gnarly Barley","nameDisplay":"Gnarly Barley","abv":"6","ibu":"42","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-11 19:26:19","updateDate":"2015-11-11 19:26:20","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:27:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"QQpuA2","name":"Madhouse Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Madhouse","website":"http:\/\/www.madhousebeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QQpuA2\/upload_hlh538-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QQpuA2\/upload_hlh538-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QQpuA2\/upload_hlh538-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QQpuA2\/upload_hlh538-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QQpuA2\/upload_hlh538-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2019-03-05 16:02:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MR6VAX7GHW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Tuj2jj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"501 Scott Ave","locality":"Des Moines","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50309","phone":"515-988-5535","website":"http:\/\/www.madhousebeer.com\/","latitude":41.5810699,"longitude":-93.607701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2016-01-04 19:47:25","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mUKAI1","name":"Gnarmadillo","nameDisplay":"Gnarmadillo","description":"Strata, Mosaic and Galaxy.","abv":"6.9","styleId":172,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-21 18:28:43","updateDate":"2019-05-21 18:28:43","style":{"id":172,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Juicy or Hazy India Pale Ale","shortName":"Juicy or Hazy IPA","description":"Color: Straw to deep gold\r\n\r\nClarity: Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
