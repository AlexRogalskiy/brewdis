Tradition, craftsmanship, and the highest standards in beer and food are our passion. We believe in using only the finest ingredients in what we make, whether they are destined for your pint glass or your plate. Our original pub is in West Dundee and houses our copper-clad, seven barrel JV Northwest system. There, we produce about 600 barrels per year, including all of the company's barrel-aged and cask-conditioned ales. We opened Downers Grove in 2004 and brew on a 15 barrel Specific Mechanical system to make about 850 barrels per year. The 10 barrel DME system at Palatine is our newest brewery and is also the home of our bottle and draft packaging operations. Our beer can be found in chain and independent retail stores, bars, and restaurants throughout the Chicago-land area.","website":"http:\/\/www.emmettsbrewingco.com","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:21:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"70CEINUA3P","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"WCBdy2","name":"Emmett's Tavern & Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"128 West Main Street","locality":"West Dundee","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60118","phone":"847-428-4500","website":"http:\/\/www.emmettstavern.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday-Thursday: 11:30am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday\/Saturday: 11:30am - 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11:30am - 9:00pm","latitude":42.0982603,"longitude":-88.2784071,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:35:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday-Thursday: 11:30am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday\/Saturday: 11:30am - 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11:30am - 9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"jln1QS","name":"Emmett's Ale House","streetAddress":"5200 Main Street","locality":"Downers Grove","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60515","phone":"630-434-8500","website":"http:\/\/www.emmettstavern.com\/","latitude":41.7925318,"longitude":-88.0105302,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2016-04-29 15:24:05","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"T2KXDr","name":"Emmett's Tavern & Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"110 N.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"8iY0UW","name":"Brewery Ferment","nameShortDisplay":"Brewery Ferment","description":"Ferment is an inviting, casual, neighborhood brewery that is truly all about the beer.

Herman\u2019s desire to expand the market for the family\u2019s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair where it received high acclaim.

With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff\u2019s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.","website":"http:\/\/berghoffbeer.com\/","established":"1887","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:24:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kU9sBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3122 W.

So it\u2019s an ALE, but with the clean character of a typical lager, and without the slight sulfury notes some lager yeasts give. So where did we come up with the recipe? The Chandlers did not have any original recipe information, so we relied on descriptions from the time, plus some information on the recipe that Evansville Brewing used when the Chandlers introduced Gerst Amber back into Nashville in the 1990\u2019s. Most of the beers that the William Gerst Brewing Company would have made would have been lagers, likely in the German style, but they did produce some ales.

Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery.

The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"DV4Kpb","name":"Everybody's Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Everybody's","website":"http:\/\/www.everybodysbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:27:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"O07X4AZ2M8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"UsMdAB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"151 East Jewett Boulevard","extendedAddress":"PO Box 2457","locality":"White Salmon","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98672","phone":"509-637-2774","website":"http:\/\/www.everybodysbrewing.com\/","latitude":45.727373,"longitude":-121.4857113,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
