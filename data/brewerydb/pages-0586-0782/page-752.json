This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"0sr0Zy","name":"Commonwealth Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Commonwealth","description":"Local family owned, full production brewery housed inside a fully renovated, former fire and rescue station in Virginia Beach.","website":"http:\/\/www.commonwealthbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0sr0Zy\/upload_CpNvSj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0sr0Zy\/upload_CpNvSj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0sr0Zy\/upload_CpNvSj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0sr0Zy\/upload_CpNvSj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0sr0Zy\/upload_CpNvSj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-27 00:19:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:07:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TGU4R6QD7I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"4qK2zX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2444 Pleasure House Rd.","locality":"Virginia Beach","region":"Virginia","phone":"757.305.9652","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thur 3pm \u2013 10pm\r\n\r\nFri 3pm \u2013 12am\r\n\r\nSat 12pm \u2013 12am\r\n\r\nSun 12pm \u2013 9pm","latitude":36.913509,"longitude":-76.131936,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-29 20:47:44","updateDate":"2016-01-29 20:47:57","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon-Thur 3pm \u2013 10pm\r\n\r\nFri 3pm \u2013 12am\r\n\r\nSat 12pm \u2013 12am\r\n\r\nSun 12pm \u2013 9pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kg0FW6","name":"Hippotizing IPA","nameDisplay":"Hippotizing IPA","description":"Our American IPA is a cross between the West Coast and New England styles.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Yeast character, flavor and aroma are desirable, yet should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur containing compounds should be apparent in aroma and flavor, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally removed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. Head retention may not be optimal. The brewer must indicate the classic style on which the entry is based to allow for accurate judging.
