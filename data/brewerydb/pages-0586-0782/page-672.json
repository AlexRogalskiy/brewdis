Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive. To stand out amongst this group, you need to push the envelope and be out there to get to your niche and magic elixir.","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:39:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KY5HWFDR7B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lijo4X","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97225","phone":"503-296-0110","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","latitude":45.485627,"longitude":-122.753996,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"DnQkrw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"939 SE Belmont","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","latitude":45.5166668,"longitude":-122.6560412,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-04 05:03:47","updateDate":"2015-07-07 13:30:30","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qRr3lQ","name":"Gose","nameDisplay":"Gose","description":"Sea salt and citrus give Gose its refreshing, dry and lightly sour profile.

By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"5HWIkT","name":"Panther Island Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Panther Island","description":"Panther Island Brewing is located on the banks of the Trinity River in Fort Worth, TX.

The band of brewers spent three years crafting batch after batch of beer, and fine tuning their recipes. Hard work, persistence, and passion for brewing spawned a crazy journey that included getting funding to build a full scale brewery in a building that has housed some of Fort Worth\u2019s oldest breweries.

All we have to say is that there is a whole lot of creativity in those vats of beer just dying to come out, and we never stop till we get it right.","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:20:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JPLOVRX46D","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"V8LP7a","name":"Bel Air","streetAddress":"16 A Bel Air South Parkway","locality":"Bel Air","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21015","phone":"410-515-3222","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","latitude":39.4976844,"longitude":-76.3312187,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2017-05-08 18:55:15","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"n2527g","name":"Arundel Mills","streetAddress":"7000 Arundel Mills Circle","extendedAddress":"Suite R4","locality":"Hanover","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21076","phone":"410-799-1166","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun & Mon:\r\nDining Room: 11:00am -

Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"T40912","name":"Monocacy Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Monocacy","description":"At Monocacy Brewing Company we focus on crafting fresh, great tasting beer.
