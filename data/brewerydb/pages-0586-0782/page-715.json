Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:48:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"K240B5MRS1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":4,"name":"Amarillo","description":"Amarillo is a privately grown and registered hop variety; it was introduced recently but has been extremely popular with brewers seeking a Cascade-type hop with a distinctive American character.

In our Garage, you can find what drives us \u2014 quality craft beer.\r\n\r\n\u200bEstablished in 2013, we began brewing in what was once an eight bay garage at the end of Old Town Temecula. The brewpub and taproom was aptly named Garage Brewing Co, not only due to its previous life, but to show an appreciation to where the craft beer industry originated \u2014 in the garages of brewers. Here, we have created a family-friendly environment where our fast-fired, Kustom-built pizzas and quality, Kustom craft beers provide unlimited possibilities of flavor while bringing friends and family together. In 2016, we expanded our business and now also have an off-site, full production brewery in Murrieta, CA.\r\n\r\n\u200bFrom the beginning, we set out on a mission: to provide top-quality craft beer that tastes fantastic and appeals to a broad spectrum of beer lovers. We are committed to excellence and only use the finest ingredients, state-of-the art equipment, and top-notch coding processes.\r\n\r\n\u200bWe maintain six core, year-round styles while also regularly rotating in seasonal creations for a total of \u00b1 15 beers on tap at all times.  As an independent brewery, we are free to modify beer recipes and develop exciting and creative spins on standard styles to please all types of beer advocates.  We routinely offer new and interesting beers to bring our customers a truly unique experience. \r\n \r\nOur brewery equipment was manufacured in North America by a company that has built over 350 breweries and has over 25 years of experience in the craft brewing industry. This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"TMc6H2","name":"SweetWater Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sweetwater","description":"February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy's dog Badger.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.
