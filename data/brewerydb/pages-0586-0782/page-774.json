The brewery, located conveniently on Blue Star Highway in Douglas, Michigan, boasts two tasting rooms and outdoor patio dining. The Pub features 16 taps, hard cider, and wine along with a full food menu including everything from unique entrees to shareable appetizers. Free, live music increases the dining experience every Saturday at 6:00 pm, along with live music on the Patio every Thursday at 6:00 pm from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Along with the Pub, the Saugatuck Brewing Company recently added on a second tap room, which has been dubbed \"The Barrel Room,\" including 15 additional taps and a variety of munchies. The Barrel Room is a laid-back tasting room where customers can enjoy a pint while playing a round of one of the many games featured, like shuffleboard, bumper pool, pinball and more.\r\n\r\nSaugatuck Brewing Company is also proud to be the only location in the state of Michigan to offer a \"Brew On Premise\"  program, where customers can come in and brew their own beer on our 3.5 barrel Brew System located in the Pub. All of the beer offered at the Saugatuck Brewing Company is brewed on site on a 45 barrel Brew System in the 14,000 square foot Production Facility. Customers can tour the facility every Saturday at 2:00 pm for $7.50\/person. Each tour includes a complimentary tasting and their choice of a logo'd pint glass or growler to take home.\r\n\r\nThe Saugatuck Brewing Company bottles 7 styles year round, including everything from a crisp Blonde Ale to exciting flavored stouts. SBC also offers a variety of interesting styles throughout the year as bottled seasonals, specialty releases and draft only beers.

Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2019-07-22 17:20:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SZ1UAXE94G","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"eOm6Xk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"500 Linden Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"1-970-221-0524","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","latitude":40.593415,"longitude":-105.066874,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:48:39","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"m1a0ra","name":"Asheville","streetAddress":"155 Craven Street","locality":"Asheville","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28806","latitude":35.588358,"longitude":-82.573548,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-06 12:29:33","updateDate":"2016-05-09 20:38:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"aigcyU","name":"Hop Knife Harvest IPA","nameDisplay":"Hop Knife Harvest IPA","description":"Hop Knife recognizes the time-honored tradition of hand-harvesting hops at the peak of maturity.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MZ5jPl","name":"Hop Knot IPA","nameDisplay":"Hop Knot IPA","description":"Our Hop Knot IPA is made only from American malt and lots of American hops, which produce a big, broad-shouldered, hoppy beer backed up by a character as warm as, well, Mom and apple pie!\r\n\r\nHop Knot IPA get its peculiar name from the weaving of four different hops added at four separate times during the brewing process.
