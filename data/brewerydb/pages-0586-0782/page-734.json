Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today\u2019s market, but the goofy and \u201cjust OK\u201d beers that home brewers in the 90\u2019s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we\u2019ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity\u2019s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.\r\n\r\nChris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OdysseyBeerwerks\/app_100265896690345","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:24:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:41:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KFRB2G1TQ7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"I4hZZy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5535 W 56th Ave,","extendedAddress":"Suite 107","locality":"Arvada","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80002","phone":"(303) 421-0772","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","latitude":39.8007911,"longitude":-105.0589359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:42:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"65mPdm","name":"Heliopause","nameDisplay":"Heliopause","abv":"5.8","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-05 20:41:14","updateDate":"2016-10-05 20:41:14","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Before coming home to Ohio, the seed of what would become a 2,500BBL capacity brewing facility was planted in a tiny carriage-house apartment on the west-side of Chicago. To test the viability of what was then called Oval Brewing, we launched and successfully completed a Kickstarter Campaign in 2012, allowing us to tackle this thing right.

A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:02"},"breweries":[{"id":"wi2NVb","name":"Metropolitan Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Metropolitan","description":"From day one, every drop of Metro beer has been brewed and packaged by us, in our warehouse production brewery in the Ravenswood Industrial Corridor of Chicago.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
