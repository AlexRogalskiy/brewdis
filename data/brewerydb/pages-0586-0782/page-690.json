(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:20:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q8W2M631AI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":22,"name":"Cascade","description":"Cascade was created in the United States as an open-pollinated cross between Fuggle and Serebrianker.

However, we soon realized we were somewhat limited and constrained by which beers were actually available in the Miami market -due to distribution and other factors. And since we're all about unfettered drinking and out of the box thinking, the concept soon changed to: \"let's brew our own!\". This way we would be free to experiment with both well known and more obscure styles and experiment with flavor profiles and combinations. The possibilities, which once looked constrained, now appeared limitless.\r\n\r\nEnter Robert Tejon and Seth Hammond! After meeting and networking within Miami's local brewer community for the better part of a year, Diego met Robert and Seth. They decided to start making some test batches, which eventually led to making one-off pilot batches for nationally-renowned events (please see our \"events\" section). As momentum gathered, we realized that there was great potential in this concept and decided that the brewpub was definitely the way we wanted to go.\r\n\r\nAs Gravity Brew Lab, our mission is to bring you uncompromising, top quality beer. Our true purpose, though, is to give you a new experience every time you sit at one of our tables and ask for a glass of beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.gravitybrewlab.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-15 22:43:22","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"nOyUmq","name":"Brewery Restaurant","locality":"Miami","region":"Florida","postalCode":"33127","phone":"(786) 536-7085","website":"http:\/\/www.gravitybrewlab.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon 12pm - 12am\r\nTue 12pm - 12am\r\nWed 12pm - 12am\r\nThu 12pm - 12am\r\nFri 12pm - 4am\r\nSat 12pm - 4am\r\nSun 12pm - 4am","latitude":25.8105183,"longitude":-80.2042436,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-16 14:27:09","updateDate":"2015-09-16 16:19:29","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon 12pm - 12am\r\nTue 12pm - 12am\r\nWed 12pm - 12am\r\nThu 12pm - 12am\r\nFri 12pm - 4am\r\nSat 12pm - 4am\r\nSun 12pm - 4am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BtyIao","name":"Grodziskie","nameDisplay":"Grodziskie","description":"This is a Polish style of beer that is smoked and made entirely with wheat, yet it maintains an unclouded appearance.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"InYD5U","name":"Grosswald Brauerei-Bauer","nameShortDisplay":"Grosswald Brauerei-Bauer","website":"http:\/\/www.grosswald.de\/","established":"1860","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Q1JGCH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Grosswaldstra\u00dfe 132","locality":"Heusweiler-Eiweiler","region":"Saarland","postalCode":"66265","latitude":49.337755,"longitude":6.92892,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-13 00:16:39","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BaFf2n","name":"Grosswald Hofgut Pils","nameDisplay":"Grosswald Hofgut Pils","abv":"5.1","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:19:21","updateDate":"2015-05-05 17:38:57","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

They will most likely not be clear, and may appear slightly hazy to moderately cloudy. Yeast character, flavor and aroma are desirable, yet should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur containing compounds should be apparent in aroma and flavor, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally removed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. Head retention may not be optimal. The brewer must indicate the classic style on which the entry is based to allow for accurate judging.
