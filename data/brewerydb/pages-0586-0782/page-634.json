But his obvious passion for the brewing craft led him to the title assistant brewer and eventually head brewer in short three years. At that time he joined forces with former NHB colleague Blair Potts to run Quality Assured Brewing, a consulting service for microbreweries throughout the North East. 1996 saw Rob as the Brew Master for both the Manchester and Westport, CT locations in The John Harvard\u2019s Brew House chain. While there, Rob won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the German Altbier category. Southern Connecticut, especially Norwalk, took a liking to Rob and that was where he became the brewmaster and operations manager for New England Brewing. He learned the sales end of beer and when the owners wanted to get out of the brewery business, Rob immediately took the opportunity to acquire the name of the company and re-locate the whole business just down the street from the kitchen where he first started making beer.","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_InDN1r-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:35:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RJDXIHMVAT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jzO9Iv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7 Selden St","locality":"Woodbridge","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06525","phone":"203-387-2222","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.3389393,"longitude":-72.9816961,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"F2erz8","name":"G-Mac's","nameDisplay":"G-Mac's","description":"G-Mac\u2019s Celtic Style Pale Ale is a crisp ale with a citrusy bite and just a hint of sweetness for that perfect balance of flavors.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"qIqpZc","name":"Magic Hat Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Magic Hat","description":"The Saturnalian Saga of Magic Hat began in 1994 when our first batch of beer was brewed in a funky little space on Flynn Avenue, in Burlington, Vermont.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"N0HzAh","name":"Arbor Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Arbor","description":"Our love affair with beer began in 1991 with our first batch of homebrew.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.
