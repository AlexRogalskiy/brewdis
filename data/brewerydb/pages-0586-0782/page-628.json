The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"9HcWSd","name":"Dragonmead Microbrewery","nameShortDisplay":"Dragonmead Microbrewery","description":"We strive to offer 35-45 different styles of beer on tap in our pub, including nitrogen-dispensed beers and two cask ales.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"E6WUse","name":"Real Ale Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Real Ale","description":"Welcome to the Texas Hill Country - the home of Real Ale Brewing Company, where a dedicated team of brewers produces quality handcrafted ales.

You pretty much had two\r\nchoices: Regular or Light. In 1989, when we brewed our first batch of Full Sail Amber, not only was it the first Amber ale here in Beervana (aka Oregon) -- it was the first craft beer to go into a bottle. And two things became immediately apparent. It wasn\u2019t Regular and it sure as heck wasn\u2019t Light. Our Amber is a sweet, malty, medium-bodied ale with a spicy, floral hop finish.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah. There are now more than 12 thriving brew pubs in the state thanks to Schirf and the bill's sponsor, Senator Mike Demeitrick of Price, Utah.","website":"http:\/\/www.utahbeers.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"q3a5ty","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1763 South 300 West","locality":"Salt Lake City","region":"Utah","postalCode":"84115","phone":"801-466-8855","website":"http:\/\/www.utahbeers.com\/","latitude":40.7322287,"longitude":-111.8996689,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2Pxkyn","name":"Full Swing","nameDisplay":"Full Swing","description":"Our brewers knocked it out of the park with this special edition IPA made from Mosaic, Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy, and Magnum hops.

The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/mailing-list","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SY2b6E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"525 East Madison Street","extendedAddress":"PO Box 776","locality":"Spring Green","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53588","phone":"608-588-3300","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","latitude":43.1754057,"longitude":-90.0616834,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2016-09-16 13:26:18","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"t61RV4","name":"Full Throttle","nameDisplay":"Full Throttle","description":"Big juicy American hops burst from this unfiltered deep amber ale.
