By the early 1980s, the last one had shuttered its doors. So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:25:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F0UN19LIE6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8dIvZw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1947 West 28th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484295,"longitude":-81.705375,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xSmsLL","name":"Great Lakes Brewpub","streetAddress":"2516 Market Avenue","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/brewpub\/around-the-brewpub","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484446,"longitude":-81.704436,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-10 17:48:32","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"383mpK","name":"Grand Madame Barleywine","nameDisplay":"Grand Madame Barleywine","abv":"11.5","styleId":17,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-19 00:51:40","updateDate":"2018-10-22 11:04:05","style":{"id":17,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"British Barleywine","description":"British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qUHHDa","name":"Grand Pumpkin","nameDisplay":"Grand Pumpkin","availableId":3,"styleId":121,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qUHHDa\/upload_Je9Lhk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qUHHDa\/upload_Je9Lhk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qUHHDa\/upload_Je9Lhk-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qUHHDa\/upload_Je9Lhk-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qUHHDa\/upload_Je9Lhk-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qUHHDa\/upload_Je9Lhk-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 13:54:18","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":121,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pumpkin Beer","shortName":"Pumpkin Beer","description":"Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.

That's why we put our beers in light-blocking brown bottles and take extra caution to keep them out of the way of direct sunlight.","website":"http:\/\/schmohz.com\/","established":"2004","mailingListUrl":"list.schmohz.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AVEsqU\/upload_uRmLOu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AVEsqU\/upload_uRmLOu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AVEsqU\/upload_uRmLOu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AVEsqU\/upload_uRmLOu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AVEsqU\/upload_uRmLOu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:08:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8QNJCDL5ZS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"A2qo35","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2600 Patterson SE","extendedAddress":"Suite A","locality":"Grand Rapids","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49546","phone":"616-949-0860","website":"http:\/\/schmohz.com\/","latitude":42.915996,"longitude":-85.548533,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"dm87SE","name":"B.O.B.'s House Of Brews","nameShortDisplay":"B.O.B.'s House Of Brews","description":"B.O.B.'s Brewery is heading in a fresh direction with a new Brewmaster and attitude.

The site was chosen by Grand Ridge for its exceptional water quality for beer making, given its position on the top of the mountains in the Strzelecki ranges. After extensive product testing to achieve the highest standards in pure beer, Grand Ridge commenced brewing in June 1989.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrand Ridge is at the top of the list in high quality beers. All the beers are produced to exceptionally high standards of flavour and purity, with no added chemicals or preservatives.  This typically results in a far less severe hangover, if any at all.\r\n\r\nAt Grand Ridge the quality of the beer is never compromised. The mission at Grand Ridge is always to make the best beer in the world. Grand Ridge is a 100% Australian, family owned company.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the Grand Ridge beers has been recognized with over 160 Australian and International beer awards. In 2002 at the Australian and International beer Awards Grand Ridge won 29 medals. This was more than any other brewery in the world including all 19 countries represented.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Grand Ridge won 21 medals including 6 best of class winners (double any other brewery in the world).

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_JF7uqw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:25:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F0UN19LIE6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8dIvZw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1947 West 28th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484295,"longitude":-81.705375,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xSmsLL","name":"Great Lakes Brewpub","streetAddress":"2516 Market Avenue","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/brewpub\/around-the-brewpub","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484446,"longitude":-81.704436,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-10 17:48:32","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yG2qM0","name":"Grandeur Peak - Ruby Red Grapefruit","nameDisplay":"Grandeur Peak - Ruby Red Grapefruit","description":"Clean, crisp and crafted with adventure in mind, our Spiked Sparkling Water goes poolside to mountainside with classic and invigorating flavors.

Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"nHLlnK","name":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Sierra Nevada","description":"The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company was established in 1980 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi.
