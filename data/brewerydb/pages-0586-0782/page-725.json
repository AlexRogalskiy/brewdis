If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling\/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QCBEW7618T","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-10:00am-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GApBby","name":"Hearthstone Chocolate Coffee","nameDisplay":"Hearthstone Chocolate Coffee","abv":"7","ibu":"47","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-29 13:52:04","updateDate":"2014-07-29 13:52:04","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

But perhaps best of all, everyone in the Allagash family loves working here.","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:08:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"59XEKZTHLU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"hP5LHZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"50 Industrial Way","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04103","phone":"800-330-5385","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","latitude":43.703215,"longitude":-70.317677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:17:35","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"b51A8U","name":"Heartwork","nameDisplay":"Heartwork","description":"In collaboration with Woodland Farm Brewery, we've made a young, unfiltered lager with an expressive vienna and munich malt character, subtle noble hop character and a bright orange hue.","abv":"5.4","ibu":"17","styleId":56,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-10-16 10:11:10","updateDate":"2019-10-16 10:11:10","style":{"id":56,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Kellerbier (Cellar beer) or Zwickelbier - Ale","shortName":"Kellerbier","description":"These beers are unfiltered German-style Altbier and K\u00f6lsch.

Inspired by some of the other small Irish brewers, they eventually decided to try and help do something about it.\r\n\r\nBusiness plans were written, torn up, and written again. Locations were scouted, breweries were visited, and - of course - various different beers were sampled to ensure they were researching the correct product portfolio. Dirty job, but someone\u2019s gotta do it.\r\n\r\nGr\u00e1inne called time on her I.T. career in Jan 2011 to focus full-time on establishing the brewery, while Tim did the honourable thing and stayed put at the day-job to pay the bills. They started brewing their beer at a brewery in Templemore (White Gypsy) while planning the construction of their own brewery in Waterford. Their first beer, Metalman Pale Ale, went on sale in the first week of March 2011, and has been very well received. The brewery took somewhat longer than expected to get up and running, but production eventually moved to Waterford in May 2012.\r\n\r\nThe name of the brewery is inspired by a navigational aid on the Waterford coast. The figure of the Metal Man was erected in 1823 after a military transport ship called the Sea Horse was wrecked off the Tramore coast, resulting in a significant loss of life. The Metal Man stands on one of three pillars overlooking the bay, his purpose to guide seafarers, and keep them on their true course.

This eagerness to ask ourselves \u201cwhat if?\u201d has earned us a slew of accolades, a shelf full of awards and devoted customers who are always eager to try what CBC comes up with next.","website":"https:\/\/www.cambridgebrewingcompany.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nvfMg1\/upload_mcniin-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2019-07-11 17:56:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HLIPT1ZMKW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EB3XVT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Kendall Square","extendedAddress":"Bldg 100","locality":"Cambridge","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02139","phone":"(617) 494-1994","website":"http:\/\/www.cambrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri: 11:30 am - 1:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":42.366468,"longitude":-71.0914549,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nTue - Thu: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri: 11:30 am - 1:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fi7Kat","name":"Heather Ale","nameDisplay":"Heather Ale","description":"2003 Silver medal winner herb and spice catagory Great American Beer Fest, made without hops, 100% heather flowers giving it a flowery aroma, subtle sweetness, and crisp, clean finish.","abv":"5.4","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fi7Kat\/upload_Tjlcdx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fi7Kat\/upload_Tjlcdx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fi7Kat\/upload_Tjlcdx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fi7Kat\/upload_Tjlcdx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fi7Kat\/upload_Tjlcdx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fi7Kat\/upload_Tjlcdx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:21","updateDate":"2015-12-16 03:51:13","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Spalt Select was reportedly chosen by Anheuser-Busch to replace Spalt Spalter and Tettnang Tettnanger hops in some of their recipes. Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau. Some growers are currently growing Spalt Select as an organic hop.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMin":2.5,"betaAcidMax":6.2,"humuleneMin":10,"humuleneMax":36,"caryophylleneMin":4,"caryophylleneMax":13,"cohumuloneMin":20,"cohumuloneMax":27,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":50,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":22,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:36","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}},{"id":"hiZjIX","name":"Heaven","nameDisplay":"Heaven","description":"Heaven golden strong ale will lift your spirits with a rich body and brilliant honey color, featuring a blend of Belgian esters, sweet orange peel and graceful notes of Tahitian vanilla beans.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"x81WXS","name":"Heaven's Helles","nameDisplay":"Heaven's Helles","description":"A German style pale lager with a golden straw color.

IPA","description":"Heaven, Hell or Hoboken walks a fine line between an IPA and Double IPA.  Coming in at 68 IBUs and 6.5% ABV, the Nugget hops really come through on the back end.  Cascade hops were added late in the boil and impart a flowery, slightly citrus smell.  The dark, amber color and slight sweetness can be attributed to the 120L specialty grains that we use.  Well balanced, hop heavy, and pretty delicious. We hope you have much fun drinking it as we did making it!","abv":"6.5","ibu":"68","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-21 21:11:47","updateDate":"2015-05-08 14:26:33","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
