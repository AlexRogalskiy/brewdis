The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EJN168","name":"Golden Hour","nameDisplay":"Golden Hour","description":"GOLDEN HOUR is the light at the end of the tunnel.

A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level. We serve local bars, restaurants, and retail outlets and have five and fifteen-gallon kegs and 22-ounce bottles available for weddings, caterers, as well as for thirsty individuals that happen to come our way. We\u2019ve now opened a new brewery in beautiful downtown Carpinteria and hope you\u2019ll stop by to visit soon.","website":"http:\/\/www.islandbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rJLqpi\/upload_JikvIB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-09 19:06:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"X5T30MZ4IU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"3A5MHE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5049 Sixth Street","locality":"Carpinteria","region":"California","postalCode":"93013","phone":"1-805-745-8272","website":"http:\/\/www.islandbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":34.3960285,"longitude":-119.5210401,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LeII8L","name":"Golden Knot","nameDisplay":"Golden Knot","styleId":113,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LeII8L\/upload_6dQnPT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LeII8L\/upload_6dQnPT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LeII8L\/upload_6dQnPT-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LeII8L\/upload_6dQnPT-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LeII8L\/upload_6dQnPT-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LeII8L\/upload_6dQnPT-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-14 14:18:14","updateDate":"2015-12-17 01:03:51","style":{"id":113,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager without Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

We were busy creating the same kind of crisp,refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage.

He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point.

The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base.

This beer has won many awards, with the most prestigious being Gold at the World Beer Cup in 2010.The Golden Pilsner is available year round at our brewery.","abv":"5.1","ibu":"35","styleId":76,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-18 18:15:22","updateDate":"2014-07-19 10:48:46","style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

We often brew hybrid styles, combining the features we like from established categories to create new, Island-Of-Doctor-Moreau-style mash-ups.\r\n\r\nFortunate Islands combines the mildly nutty malt body of a wheat beer with the intensely bright, citrusy hoppiness of a righteous IPA. Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches.
