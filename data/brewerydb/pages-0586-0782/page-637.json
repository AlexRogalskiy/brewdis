Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.","website":"http:\/\/skullcoastales.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kXV5lc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"802 Somerton Drive","locality":"Fort Mill","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29715","phone":"803-619-9295","latitude":35.011366,"longitude":-80.956275,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-08-25 14:13:48","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"TjzLgu","name":"Hickory Location","streetAddress":"883 Highland Ave SE","locality":"Hickory","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28602","latitude":35.735156,"longitude":-81.325672,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-20 18:52:08","updateDate":"2016-08-25 14:13:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sN8EcK","name":"Gallus 612 - Old Style Ale","nameDisplay":"Gallus 612 - Old Style Ale","description":"Ein Bier, wie es auch Gallus gemundet h\u00e4tte.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:40:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M8ICS1LEDY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wbpj5b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3912 W McLean Ave","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60647","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.9180876,"longitude":-87.7260612,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-06-16 17:16:46","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7Oqome","name":"Game of Thrones - Mother of Dragons","nameDisplay":"Game of Thrones - Mother of Dragons","description":"Brewed and blended for a leader who takes what is hers with fire and blood, Mother of Dragons is a blend of a smoked porter and a Belgian kriek, representing the smoke and fire that Daenerys has unleashed on her opponents.","abv":"6.6","styleId":38,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Oqome\/upload_36p2dW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Oqome\/upload_36p2dW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Oqome\/upload_36p2dW-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Oqome\/upload_36p2dW-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Oqome\/upload_36p2dW-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7Oqome\/upload_36p2dW-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-19 13:44:00","updateDate":"2018-10-19 13:44:26","style":{"id":38,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Smoke Porter","shortName":"Smoke Porter","description":"Smoke porters are chestnut brown to black in color.

Through its first three seasons, the critically acclaimed drama has become the biggest show on HBO. Take the Black Stout follows the highly coveted Iron Throne Blonde Ale, which flew off of shelves earlier this year. To satisfy the appetite of Game of Thrones fans, production of Take the Black Stout will more than double the final volumes of Iron Throne Blonde Ale. \r\n\r\nInspired by the brotherhood of the Night\u2019s Watch, Take the Black Stout was made to be deep, dark and complex like those who have sworn the oath to defend Westeros against threats from the north. The label depicts the Weirwood tree where Jon Snow recited the oath before joining the Night\u2019s Watch. \r\n\r\nThe beer pours black with a good amount of tan head (though the kegs were pouring a bit foamy). Aroma has a rich chocolate malt with a good amount of red fruit. The mouthfeel has an average carbonation with a medium body. The flavor starts on a rich red fruit flavor, reminiscent of plum, that moves to a roasty malt with hints of chocolate and molasses that finishes on a subtle licorice bite. The aftertaste has a slightly dry, chalky mouthfeel possessing a lingering licorice flavor with a slight bitterness. As you drink it a slight warming develops in the back of the palate\r\n\r\nIn time for the holidays, Take the Black Stout makes for the perfect gift. Shipping to distributors in September 2013, the beer is available in 750 ML bottles and 1\/6 barrel kegs.","abv":"7","availableId":4,"styleId":64,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NNLqJ4\/upload_fWxTND-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NNLqJ4\/upload_fWxTND-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NNLqJ4\/upload_fWxTND-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NNLqJ4\/upload_fWxTND-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NNLqJ4\/upload_fWxTND-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NNLqJ4\/upload_fWxTND-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-04 17:15:07","updateDate":"2016-07-07 19:27:35","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":64,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Dark Strong","description":"Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"bv8S0U","name":"Barrel Culture","nameShortDisplay":"Barrel Culture","description":"Durham, NC Brewery producing 100% Oak fermented, rustic fruit driven, wild artisanal style ales that marry local terroir and aggressive flavor profiles.","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bv8S0U\/upload_ITWRYU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bv8S0U\/upload_ITWRYU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bv8S0U\/upload_ITWRYU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bv8S0U\/upload_ITWRYU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bv8S0U\/upload_ITWRYU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-10 17:14:57","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:19:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5FUGW7MNEX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"w1ndc4","name":"Barrel Culture","streetAddress":"4913 S Alston Ave","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27713","phone":"(919) 908-9659","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BarrelCulture\/","hoursOfOperation":"Closed Monday, Tuesday, Sunday","latitude":35.893296,"longitude":-78.888539,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-12 20:06:30","updateDate":"2018-04-12 20:06:55","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-3:00pm-8:00pm,fri-3:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm,wed-3:00pm-8:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Closed Monday, Tuesday, Sunday","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NJVYHO","name":"Game Over Man","nameDisplay":"Game Over Man","description":"Crisp and refreshing, brewed in the classic Kolsch style, Game Over Man is perfect for summer nights in the wilderness when you can't figure out what to do next.

One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home brew around that time and would share his batches with the Goulets and their friends. What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"QxHEpY","name":"Packinghouse Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Packinghouse","description":"More than a century ago the California citrus industry was born in our own city of Riverside.
