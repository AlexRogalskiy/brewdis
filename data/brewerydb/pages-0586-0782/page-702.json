We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fVgk4H","name":"Hallertauer Hop Ale","nameDisplay":"Hallertauer Hop Ale","abv":"5.4","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 12:33:49","updateDate":"2015-06-12 15:09:16","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"gaVq6l","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.7440738,"longitude":10.2044564,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-11-20 18:30:48","timezoneId":"Europe\/Oslo","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6amO3A","name":"Hallo Ich Bin Berliner Weisse (Apricot)","nameDisplay":"Hallo Ich Bin Berliner Weisse (Apricot)","abv":"3.7","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6amO3A\/upload_QNV7Ha-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6amO3A\/upload_QNV7Ha-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6amO3A\/upload_QNV7Ha-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6amO3A\/upload_QNV7Ha-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6amO3A\/upload_QNV7Ha-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6amO3A\/upload_QNV7Ha-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-02 19:34:29","updateDate":"2017-08-02 19:35:16","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.

William, pictured here with his mother, went on to marry Priscilla Needham in 1899 and became Chairman of Frederic Robinson Limited in 1920.\r\nFast forward to the early decades of the 20th century and Frederic\u2019s grandchildren, sons of William, joined the family business. After Frederic\u2019s passing, his widow Emma owned the business in entirety and it was shortly prior to her death that she instigated the formation of Frederic Robinson Limited. 4th generation Robinsons, Frederic, John and Cecil joined the board and continued to build the company alongside their father William.\r\n\r\nWith bottling commencing from a new building in 1908, new offices in 1913 and a new brewhouse in 1929, by William\u2019s death in 1933, despite the countries difficult economic climate, Robinsons was strongly positioned for further growth. Over the following years, the estate grew by acquisition, new buildings and extending the geographical area. The first Welsh house \u2013 The Black Lion was bought in 1943. William Robinson, would have been proud to hear John, his great grandchild, was honoured with a knighthood in 1958 for political and public services in Cheshire- 120 years after William purchased the Unicorn Inn. The early 1950\u2019s saw 5th generation Robinsons, Peter, Dennis and David, starting to join the business.\r\n\r\nOver the past 6 decades Robinsons has continued to grow. 15th October 1975 saw the first bottling at a newly built packaging centre in Bredbury- ongoing development at UPC (Unicorn Packaging Centre) means all our beers are now transferred from Unicorn Brewery to Bredbury for packaging and distribution once fermentation is complete. Robinsons\u2019 bottled ales such as Old Tom and Unicorn are distributed worldwide. The sixth generation strive to build further upon the family legacy. Neil, Veronica, Paul, Oliver and William were elected to the board in September 2003, followed three years later by Sara, who is now Company Secretary and John in May 2009.\r\n\r\nOur eyes are firmly on the future as we develop brewery, brands and pubs at pace. With over \u00a35 million investment in a new Brew House (including the World\u2019s largest hopnik, which strains hops to maximise aroma and flavour), Training Centre for excellence and Visitors Centre, there is much to look forward to.","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","established":"1838","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_eVt4LU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_eVt4LU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_eVt4LU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_eVt4LU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_eVt4LU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lxWkzT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unicorn Brewery","locality":"Stockport","region":"Cheshire","postalCode":"SK11JJ","phone":"44-(0161)-480-6571","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","latitude":53.4101496,"longitude":-2.1551029,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"1838","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Opal8e","name":"Halloween Ale","nameDisplay":"Halloween Ale","description":"Every fall marks the return of our legendary Extra Special Bitter for the season, Halloween Ale \u2013 the beer so good, it's scary!

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.
