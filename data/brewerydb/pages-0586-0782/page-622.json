But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....\r\n \r\nJosh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.\r\nJosh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   \r\nFast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  \r\n\r\nMany weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  \r\n\r\nGoodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, \"I'm coming over to your house.\"  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  \"Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.\" \r\n\r\nJosh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. \r\n\r\nOne week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was\r\na hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!\r\n \r\nNow that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours. No matter what the occasion, visiting The Public House Brewery is always an extraordinary experience.  \r\n \r\nThe team at Public House looks forward to welcoming you!","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-12-18 19:07:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5SH064IZ1R","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"e0v4NA","name":"Rolla Brewpub","streetAddress":"600 North Rolla Street","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Rolla","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65401","phone":"573-426-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","latitude":37.9489305,"longitude":-91.7721244,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:44:16","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Dch3p7","name":"Public House Brewing Company","streetAddress":"551 State Route B","locality":"St. James","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65559","phone":"573-261-3333","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com","latitude":38.009672,"longitude":-91.6072769,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-27 16:11:23","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:05:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-7:00pm,mon-11:00am-7:00pm,tue-11:00am-7:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gbZx1Y","name":"Friends in the Wild #4","nameDisplay":"Friends in the Wild #4","description":"A series of mixed ferment pale sour beers showcasing a rotating lineup of fruit + hop combos.

Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"pzWq1r","name":"Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Jolly Pumpkin","description":"Welcome to a land of open fermentation, oak barrel aging, and bottle conditioning.

From hopped up American IPAs to Belgian-Style Ales, we're brewing the kind of beer that we love to drink, and we're looking forward to sharing it with everbody who's willing to join us.","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-13 17:12:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:27:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CR4JG12LNA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"VAj3CW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8700 W. 47th St.","locality":"Lyons","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60534","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com\/brewery\/","latitude":41.8060004,"longitude":-87.8370967,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 18:28:06","updateDate":"2015-01-14 20:24:00","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-12:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"g76Kk6","name":"Fritzie's Lager","nameDisplay":"Fritzie's Lager","abv":"4.9","styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-22 15:04:21","updateDate":"2015-09-22 15:04:21","style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:54:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8tHhXL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Fugleb\u00e6kvej 2 C","region":"Kastrup","postalCode":"2770","phone":"+45 32 50 62 00 \u200e","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","latitude":55.624252,"longitude":12.595661,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DK","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:55:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DK","name":"DENMARK","displayName":"Denmark","isoThree":"DNK","numberCode":208,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qc4OgJ","name":"From Away IPA","nameDisplay":"From Away IPA","description":"A heavily hopped ipa brewed to favor flavor and aroma over bitterness and emphasizing pine, peach, tropical fruit, and citrus hop flavors with a biscuit malt foundation.","abv":"7","ibu":"81","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-25 13:21:51","updateDate":"2018-03-25 13:21:51","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
