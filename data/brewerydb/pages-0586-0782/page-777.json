This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:49:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZVWX7SOR0P","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HtFqFO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"831 W Bonanza Rd","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89106","phone":"702-362-7335","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","latitude":36.176722,"longitude":-115.15317,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:35:55","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"w3DiBa","name":"Hop Riot","nameDisplay":"Hop Riot","description":"A one-time release of an Imperial IPA.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"txhujB","name":"Jekyll Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Jekyll","description":"Produce the highest quality beer with passion.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
