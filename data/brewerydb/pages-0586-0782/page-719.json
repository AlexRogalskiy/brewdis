We don\u2019t shy away from paying a bit more for exactly what we want, like the Mosaic hop in the Lightning Tree IPA.  Asa ferments the beer using a variety of different yeast strains to keep each beer tasting unique, and he filters all the ales except the Witbier.  Our custom built stainless steel glycol-jacketed brewery helps Asa get the results that he wants.
