This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.","website":"http:\/\/www.abita.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-09 19:06:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4IH367RVQ0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"d8IJKF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"PO Box 1510","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"800-737-2311","latitude":30.4785257,"longitude":-90.0375755,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:14","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"PdSE1h","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21084 Louisiana 36","locality":"Covington","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70433","phone":"9858933143","latitude":30.482138,"longitude":-90.055185,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:34:50","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:30","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1xB2B8","name":"Brewpub","streetAddress":"72011 Holly Street","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"(985) 892-5837","website":"http:\/\/www.abitabrewpub.com\/","latitude":30.4787911,"longitude":-90.0392975,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:36:40","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:14:30","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rpGpNI","name":"Golden","nameDisplay":"Golden","abv":"4.5","glasswareId":5,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rpGpNI\/upload_KcVCqH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rpGpNI\/upload_KcVCqH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rpGpNI\/upload_KcVCqH-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rpGpNI\/upload_KcVCqH-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rpGpNI\/upload_KcVCqH-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rpGpNI\/upload_KcVCqH-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-19 18:24:19","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:47:18","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

The year was 2008, we decided that we would not tolerate living in a beer desert any more.

Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness.

It was a modest beginning with some obstacles, but enthusiasm prevailed and thanks to the support of our loyal customers, it was a success! Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District. The Railyard area is a busy arts and entertainment district, where you can find a different show, market or exhibit every day of the week. Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility. Our goal in this taproom is to bring together the spirit of Second Street and our new neighborhood; An ever changing rotation of our unique beers, featured beer from other New Mexico breweries, unique food, friendly service, and curated live music featuring local and national artists.  \r\n\r\nIn 2018 we started packaging and distributing Second Street beer statewide. You can now enjoy Santa Fe\u2019s favorite beer on draft in restaurants and bars, and purchase it in cans to bring home and to your next gathering. We look forward to expanding our can options to include seasonal and special edition brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2019-06-12 17:42:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HYMUDNW6KP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HlrMmv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1814 Second Street","locality":"Santa Fe","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87505","phone":"1-505-982-3030","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","latitude":35.6633395,"longitude":-105.9659469,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9eVz7n","name":"Railyard","streetAddress":"1607 Paseo De Peralta","extendedAddress":"#10","locality":"Santa Fe","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87501","phone":"(505) 989-3278","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","latitude":35.6821338,"longitude":-105.9490908,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-10-30 11:44:38","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5X00GY","name":"Golden Ale","nameDisplay":"Golden Ale","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5X00GY\/upload_B5ETll-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5X00GY\/upload_B5ETll-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5X00GY\/upload_B5ETll-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5X00GY\/upload_B5ETll-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5X00GY\/upload_B5ETll-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5X00GY\/upload_B5ETll-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-20 14:00:45","updateDate":"2015-12-17 10:27:44","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

This pub was originally built as there were few inner city pubs that would let anything but generic brands on tap, so the pub decided to build a microbrewery on-site to brew its own beers. It has since then become renowned as the home of great craft beers in not only Western Australia, but across the country.\r\n\r\nOur Sail & Anchor craft beer range has been named in honour of this special craft beer pub in the Port of Fremantle, Western Australia. Taking inspiration from Fremantle\u2019s iconic Sail & Anchor Hotel, the Sail & Anchor craft beer range is made just a few clicks east of the pub. The range includes a refreshing Pale Ale, crisp Golden Ale, thirst-quenching Amber Ale and flavoursome IPA best enjoyed simply by opening the bottle.","website":"http:\/\/www.sailandanchorbeer.com.au","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-18 19:26:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MiO4CS","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Port of Fremantle","region":"Western Austrailia","latitude":-32.0541798,"longitude":115.7340351,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-18 19:28:06","updateDate":"2017-08-23 17:57:29","timezoneId":"Australia\/Perth","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xwiqoF","name":"Golden Ale","nameDisplay":"Golden Ale","description":"Built for the warmer months (of which Florida has plenty), Cigar City Brewing\u2019s Golden Ale is brewed with American Willamette hops and pale wheat malt to create a low-alcohol American Golden Ale that balances bread-like malt flavors with herbaceous hops and a vibrant carbonation.","abv":"4.5","ibu":"28","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xwiqoF\/upload_3ZCdL6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xwiqoF\/upload_3ZCdL6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xwiqoF\/upload_3ZCdL6-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xwiqoF\/upload_3ZCdL6-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xwiqoF\/upload_3ZCdL6-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xwiqoF\/upload_3ZCdL6-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-10-15 16:20:36","updateDate":"2019-10-15 16:21:10","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Belgium. Boy on bike. (OK, make that a young man of 32). As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement.

A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jt43j7\/upload_vl6lJv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2019-07-22 17:20:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SZ1UAXE94G","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"eOm6Xk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"500 Linden Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"1-970-221-0524","website":"http:\/\/www.newbelgium.com\/","latitude":40.593415,"longitude":-105.066874,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:48:39","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"m1a0ra","name":"Asheville","streetAddress":"155 Craven Street","locality":"Asheville","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28806","latitude":35.588358,"longitude":-82.573548,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-06 12:29:33","updateDate":"2016-05-09 20:38:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ell5tX","name":"Golden Ale","nameDisplay":"Golden Ale","description":"Pale and crisp light bodied ale, fruity with a restrained hoppy dryness created by our own Hallertauer & Tettnanger hop flowers.
