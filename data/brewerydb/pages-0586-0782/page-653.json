It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

These pale beers are brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Diacetyl should be absent.

These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional gueuze lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.

Some are convinced that the ginseng root also contains aphrodisiac properties. Whether or not that last part is true, as dedicated beer drinkers, we can seriously get behind each of these potential health enhancers!\r\n\r\nPrimarily cultivated in Asia and the United States, wild ginseng can be harvested up and down the East Coast, where it occurs naturally from Georgia to Maine. When Legion\u2019s Brew Staff decided to incorporate this power-packed root into one of our brews, Associate Brewer, Scott Griffin reached out to a friend from his youth who forages for wild ginseng in the mountains of Virginia.\r\nAs it turns out, Legion Brewing\u2019s roots in Virginia run deep. Co-founder and Brewmaster, Phil Buchy grew up in Roanoke, VA, attending college at Virginia Tech. Taproom Manager and Media Maven, Brittany Smith spent the first part of her life in Franklin County, VA, prior to settling in Charlotte in 2006.\r\n\r\nGinseng in hand, our brewers dropped finely-shaved flecks into a kettle-soured brew alongside lemongrass, coriander and salt. The result? A thirst-quenching Gose like no other! With a nod to its most unique ingredient, we\u2019re calling this beer \u201cGinseng is for Lovers.\u201d (Gose, 5.4% ABV, 5 IBUs).\r\n\r\nA highly-carbonated, tart and fruity wheat ale, Ginseng is for Lovers is a very refreshing beer with a restrained coriander and salt character. In the absence of bitterness, expect bright flavors and high attenuation with this brew. Ginseng is for Lovers also offers a lemon tartness that finds support from subtle notes of pepper and spice.\r\n\r\nAccording to Scott, \u201cThe ginseng we added contributes notes of black pepper and ginger, which are really unique components that would not be considered part of a traditional gose. The perfect beer for warm afternoons, Ginseng is for Lovers has quickly become my favorite beer on Legion\u2019s draught list.\u201d\r\n\r\nHead Brewer, Alexa Long adds, \u201cNow that 80 degree days are upon us, our staff decided it was time to offer our customers some refreshing, crushable brews. With Ginseng is for Lovers, lemongrass and coriander contribute a heavy citrus characteristic, reminiscent of a personal favorite of mine, Lemonheads candies. These citrus notes balance and complement elements of spice derived from the ginseng.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether you grab this gose for the medicinal qualities of the ginseng root (or perhaps because you are a fan of Lemonheads), we think you\u2019ll love this brew. And if \u2018Ginseng for Lovers\u2019 enhances your love life in any way, perhaps this beer is just what the doctor ordered\u2026","abv":"5.4","ibu":"5","styleId":165,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-05-09 13:50:06","updateDate":"2017-05-09 13:50:06","style":{"id":165,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Contemporary Gose","shortName":"Contemporary Gose","description":"Contemporary Goses are straw to medium amber, or, may take on the hue of added fruits or other ingredients if present.

Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"A4kfNJ","name":"Legion Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Legion","description":"Legion Brewing Company was born from the ethos that sharing good beer with friends is one of life\u2019s great pleasures.
