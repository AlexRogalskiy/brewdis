A minimum 51% of the fermentable carbohydrates must be derived from malted grains. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used and creativity should be considered. Beers such as garden (vegetable), fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:02"},"breweries":[{"id":"ScZdj3","name":"Magnolia Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Magnolia","description":"Brewery and gastropub in San Francisco's Haight Ashbury District with a new production brewery and BBQ restaurant, Smokestack,now open in the Dogpatch neighborhood.","website":"http:\/\/www.magnoliabrewing.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/magnoliapub.com\/brewsletter.html","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ScZdj3\/upload_ORlyR5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ScZdj3\/upload_ORlyR5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ScZdj3\/upload_ORlyR5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ScZdj3\/upload_ORlyR5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ScZdj3\/upload_ORlyR5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"o8mhnm","name":"Magnolia Pub & Brewery","streetAddress":"1398 Haight Street","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94117","phone":"(415) 864-7468","website":"http:\/\/www.magnoliapub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 1:00am\r\nSat:  10:00am - 1:00am\r\nSun:  10:00am - 11:00pm","latitude":37.7703879,"longitude":-122.4451741,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-07-24 13:50:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 1:00am\r\nSat:  10:00am - 1:00am\r\nSun:  10:00am - 11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vgZmk5","name":"Smokestack BBQ\/Magnolia Dogpatch","streetAddress":"2505 3rd Street","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94107","phone":"415-864-7468","website":"http:\/\/www.magnoliasmokestack.com","latitude":37.7577292,"longitude":-122.3881371,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 18:06:24","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:25:04","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"2:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"2:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"2:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-4:00pm-12:00am,mon-4:00pm-12:00am,tue-4:00pm-12:00am,wed-4:00pm-12:00am,thu-4:00pm-2:00am,fri-4:00pm-2:00am,sat-4:00pm-2:00am","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fkGj8m","name":"Golden Treasure","nameDisplay":"Golden Treasure","description":"For those who enjoy a clean, crisp, refreshing beer this medium copper colored brew is perfect.

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WtMfgN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","latitude":40.2795364,"longitude":-75.2143123,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:09:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uV6ou7","name":"Golden Triangle Triple","nameDisplay":"Golden Triangle Triple","abv":"8.5","styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:17","updateDate":"2015-05-27 16:49:44","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"OR1ggJ","name":"Beaus All Natural Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Beaus All Natural","description":"Beaus is located inside an old tannery in an industrial park, and makes some of the best craft brews in Canada, showing ingenuity in their craft, but also in marketing and distribution.

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.

Slight yeast haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"Gnjzbl","name":"Evil Czech Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Evil Czech","description":"Evil Czech has been operating since 2011 and opened it's doors to a new 20 barrel facility in 2014.\r\n\r\n... sometimes for beer to be good, it has to get evil.","website":"http:\/\/www.evilczechbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gnjzbl\/upload_YpxuGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gnjzbl\/upload_YpxuGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gnjzbl\/upload_YpxuGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gnjzbl\/upload_YpxuGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gnjzbl\/upload_YpxuGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-11 11:39:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:00:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7IXAPLS8ZT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"1yMrDb","name":"Evil Czech Brewery Culver","streetAddress":"530 S.
