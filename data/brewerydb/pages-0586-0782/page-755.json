My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5R2O1T6ZQL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5R4Akp","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1837 North Avenue","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53083","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.773281,"longitude":-87.730762,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2017-04-20 18:09:30","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-10:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm,wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Tboysq","name":"Hoedown Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Hoedown Brown Ale","description":"Just what you're looking for in this beer.

The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"e4GHxW","name":"Brouwerij Hoegaarden","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij Hoegaarden","website":"http:\/\/www.hoegaarden.com\/","established":"1966","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/e4GHxW\/upload_NFi79h-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/e4GHxW\/upload_NFi79h-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/e4GHxW\/upload_NFi79h-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/e4GHxW\/upload_NFi79h-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/e4GHxW\/upload_NFi79h-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"95h0NL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Stoopkensstraat 46","locality":"Hoegaarden","region":"Vlaams Brabant","phone":"32-016-76-98-11","latitude":50.7778218,"longitude":4.8877546,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2017-08-29 13:35:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
