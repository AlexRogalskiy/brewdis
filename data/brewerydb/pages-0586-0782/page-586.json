And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"7aAj1F","name":"Braindead Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Braindead","description":"Where the inmates run the asylum.\r\n\r\n32 house and guest beers on draft, badass food and a sweet bottle list.","website":"http:\/\/braindeadbrewing.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7aAj1F\/upload_CzS2FA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7aAj1F\/upload_CzS2FA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7aAj1F\/upload_CzS2FA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7aAj1F\/upload_CzS2FA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7aAj1F\/upload_CzS2FA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-10 14:28:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:26:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"47YT0QKEZ6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"UlCPEl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2625 Main St.","locality":"Dallas","region":"Texas","latitude":32.783817,"longitude":-96.785386,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 19:01:18","updateDate":"2015-06-15 19:01:18","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ViFmTR","name":"Fill the Void","nameDisplay":"Fill the Void","description":"The long days of summer in the 904 beckon for a beer that is perfect on a warm and sunny afternoon spent in the company of good friends.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

We like to experiment with unique processes, wacky microbes, and local ingredients among other things. The brewery is comprised of four partners: Bob Kunz, Ross Stephenson, Michael Blackman and Dustin Lancaster, with Bob primarily guiding the beer along its path. Overall, Highland Park Brewery has a fairly simple goal of making excellent beer and having a good time along the journey.","website":"http:\/\/www.thehermosillo.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 14:05:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:57:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"74UFX06QSE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"noV8kb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5125 York Blvd","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90042","phone":"(323) 739-6459","latitude":34.1211667,"longitude":-118.2037952,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 14:05:08","updateDate":"2015-11-18 21:19:31","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
