Two of my favorite things to do was chasing fireflies with a mason jar and indulging in the sweet nectar of the honeysuckle flower, which grew wild throughout my neighborhood. My favorite time of the year is when I see fireflies for the first time and it takes me back to that period in my life. This light, crisp, refreshing summer ale with the sweet, fruity, floral flavors of delicious honeysuckle pays homage to those warm summer evenings when life was so simple. And of course, it must be served in a mason jar!

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"LU3fWq","name":"Bad Weather Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Bad Weather","description":"Bad Weather knows the beer-lover's calendar is one that changes with seasons.

From its early days St Louis was a major source of brick making, and the rivers carried those bricks in every direction building communities throughout our region.  Those bricks remind us that we are all connected, and we continue that tradition today bringing the fruits of the region back to the city, and crafting authentic hard ciders to celebrate with our friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe story of connections flowing back and forth with St Louis and the wider region has repeated again and again across countless families and generations.  Brick River founder Russ John\u2019s family got its start in America when his great grandfather Theodore enlisted in the Union Cavalry in 1862 at Jefferson Barracks, St Louis.  In 1869 Theodore established a homestead farm and orchards in southeast Nebraska, and the John family has been growing apples in the Midwest ever since.  Today his great grandson is proud to bring a family tradition of hard cider back to St Louis with the city\u2019s first dedicated ciderworks.\r\n\r\nBrick River Cider Company\u2019s mission is to work with regional fruit growers to craft authentic hard cider using only fresh pressed fruit juices.  Our ciders range from classic and traditional to bold and innovative, but whatever the style they are all 100% gluten free from fresh pressed regional fruit, never concentrate.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"NXRM7y","name":"Lord Hobo Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Lord Hobo","description":"Hoppy Ales from the Hills of Woburn","website":"http:\/\/lordhobobrewing.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NXRM7y\/upload_jinHQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NXRM7y\/upload_jinHQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NXRM7y\/upload_jinHQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NXRM7y\/upload_jinHQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/NXRM7y\/upload_jinHQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 18:33:47","updateDate":"2019-06-10 11:28:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"I801LER672","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"pUVZvr","name":"Lord Hobo Brewing Company","streetAddress":"5 Draper St","locality":"Woburn","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01801","phone":"7812810809","website":"http:\/\/lordhobobrewing.com","latitude":42.47621,"longitude":-71.128878,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 18:41:30","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:36:05","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-9:00pm,tue-4:00pm-9:00pm,wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"etFipC","name":"Fireside","nameDisplay":"Fireside","description":"Smooth dark amber malty brew with a warm ginger aroma and a sweet bitter & spicy finish., the perfect beer for the cold winter nights.","abv":"4.7","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/etFipC\/upload_ZUiWgs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/etFipC\/upload_ZUiWgs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/etFipC\/upload_ZUiWgs-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/etFipC\/upload_ZUiWgs-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/etFipC\/upload_ZUiWgs-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/etFipC\/upload_ZUiWgs-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-27 15:02:15","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:28:40","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

The lead beers of the blend are Bravo, a lean and oak-forward imperial brown ale and Stickee Monkee, a huge brown sugar infused barley wine. These beers are beautiful on their own but together they bring rich molasses drenched oak flavors and cinnamon glazed almond aromas lifted by high alcohol. In the middle of the blend are our two favorite stouts, Parabola and Velvet Merkin, working in concert to provide a dusty cocoa mocha aroma and bitter dark chocolate flavors. Somehow together in this blend I am reminded of Bourbon-soaked chocolate chip cookie dough! Double DBA makes the blend again this year, bringing its signature vanilla-infused cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e flavor. Helldorado, our blonde barley wine, helps to bring balance with its honey notes and light leather nuances. Like last year, a dash of Wookey Jack made the cut bringing with it some fresh hop notes derived from bold Citra and Amarillo creating even more interesting complexity. All together I find XVII to be full of soft chocolate and warm spice perfectly balanced by toasted coconut, bourbon barrel notes and smooth creamy malt mellowness. The finished blend is unfiltered and unfined, so there will be a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  XVII is best enjoyed poured carefully into a half-filled brandy snifter or red wine glass.  Allow it to warm to 55F to fully enjoy the pleasing and complex aromas.  It takes a while, but as this beer sits and breathes in the glass, more rich chocolate and spice character is revealed as the ethereal spirit characters dissipate - so take your time. If you wait to open your bottle later, store it in a cool dark place. I suspect that this beer will age well and change favorably for years to come. It was an absolute pleasure in the making and I truly hope you enjoy our eighth oak-aged blend. The journey continues and it\u2019s just as fun and exciting now as it was back in 1996.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"qghrkC","name":"Firestone Walker Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Firestone Walker","description":"Founded in 1996 by Adam Firestone (aka the Bear) & David Walker (aka the Lion), Firestone Walker Brewing Company began as a small brewery with roots in wine country on California\u2019s Central Coast.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
