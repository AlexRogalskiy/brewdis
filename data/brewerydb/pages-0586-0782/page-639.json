Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"BVG7Ls","name":"Abandon Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Abandon","description":"Overlooking beautiful Keuka Lake, we brew many different Belgian and Farmstyle craft beers for the Penn Yan and surrounding Finger Lakes areas.","website":"http:\/\/www.abandonbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_Q0UI0y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_Q0UI0y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_Q0UI0y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_Q0UI0y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_Q0UI0y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:36:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:24:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6HJMAFW9N5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WLxlVR","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"2994 Merritt Hill Rd","locality":"Penn Yan","region":"New York","postalCode":"14527-8938","phone":"(585) 209-3276","website":"http:\/\/www.abandonbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.631829,"longitude":-77.104915,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:37:40","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:05:14","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ovaAkL","name":"Garrido","nameDisplay":"Garrido","abv":"12","styleId":140,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-30 00:14:31","updateDate":"2018-05-24 18:03:37","style":{"id":140,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Dry Mead","shortName":"Dry Mead","description":"Similar in balance, body, finish and flavor intensity to a dry white wine, with a pleasant mixture of subtle honey character, soft fruity esters, and clean alcohol.

This exploration of crafting his own fermented beverages brought him to his discovery of mead which took his creativity and passion by storm.\r\nToday, he has become a notable award-winning mead maker who's products have wowed even the most discerning and educated of palates. He also serves on the board of directors for the American Mead Makers Assosication and is the owner of the fastest growing meadery in the country.\r\nMelovino Meadery's gauge of success is not based on the number of awards we have won, although those are nice.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"TeUjYf","name":"Libertine Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Libertine","description":"Brewpub and small batch wild blends on the Central Coast of California.
