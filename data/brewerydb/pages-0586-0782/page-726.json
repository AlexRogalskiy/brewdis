Allay your fears my friends because I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.","abv":"4.5","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:21","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:02","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us. Thank you for keeping our dream alive.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.brotherscraftbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/R4fiI1\/upload_GjoLOp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/R4fiI1\/upload_GjoLOp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/R4fiI1\/upload_GjoLOp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/R4fiI1\/upload_GjoLOp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/R4fiI1\/upload_GjoLOp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:39:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:54:38","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9DG5S30Z6U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8n537L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"800 North Main St.","locality":"Harrisonburg","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22802","phone":"(540) 435-6008","website":"https:\/\/brotherscraftbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.4576002,"longitude":-78.8612002,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:40:25","updateDate":"2016-09-14 13:02:49","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8clHlO","name":"Heaven\u2019s Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Heaven\u2019s Hefeweizen","description":"Northwest wheat and two row barley.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lGZyoB","name":"Heavy Iron Works","nameDisplay":"Heavy Iron Works","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lGZyoB\/upload_4haBfu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lGZyoB\/upload_4haBfu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lGZyoB\/upload_4haBfu-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lGZyoB\/upload_4haBfu-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lGZyoB\/upload_4haBfu-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lGZyoB\/upload_4haBfu-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:21","updateDate":"2018-11-02 15:50:03","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

To achieve this vision, we stand our craft beers on the shoulders of native ingredients and artisan practices, balancing them with modern-day expertise.","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@trilliumbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:53:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"452A9H071U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0vUBsZ","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Brookline","region":"Massachusetts","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.333473,"longitude":-71.120476,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Vy6jKr","name":"Trillium Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"369 Congress St","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"(617) 453-8745","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":42.3498417,"longitude":-71.0480154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-23 17:57:40","updateDate":"2015-08-17 16:26:05","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xrLwng","name":"Canton Tasting Room","streetAddress":"110 Shawmut Rd.","locality":"Canton","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02021","phone":"781-562-0073","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1844198,"longitude":-71.1524525,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-03 20:17:35","updateDate":"2016-06-09 15:27:13","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-12:00pm-7:30pm,tue-12:00pm-7:30pm,wed-12:00pm-7:30pm,thu-12:00pm-7:30pm,fri-12:00pm-7:30pm,sat-12:00pm-7:30pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":4,"name":"Amarillo","description":"Amarillo is a privately grown and registered hop variety; it was introduced recently but has been extremely popular with brewers seeking a Cascade-type hop with a distinctive American character.

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"AEIXNf","name":"Apocalypse Ale Works","nameShortDisplay":"Apocalypse Ale Works","description":"Apocalypse Ale Works is the first brewery in Forest, Virginia since Thomas Jefferson brewed in the 1800's at Poplar Forest.
