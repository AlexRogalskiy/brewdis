These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches.

Approximately 10% of Ayinger beers are exported, mainly to Italy, the United States, and the rest of Europe. Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchener Str. 21, 85653, Germany","region":"Aying","postalCode":"85653","phone":"49080958890","latitude":47.972169,"longitude":11.773846,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2017-08-23 12:59:17","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","tourInfo":"Regular guided tours of the brewery in German\r\n(not including food):\r\nTuesdays at 11 a.m.\r\nThursdays at 6 p.m.\r\nSaturdays at 10 a.m.\r\nGroup tours required in other languages than German: by arrangement.\r\n\r\nBeer Culture Experience for corporate groups, \r\nassociations and clubs:\r\nGuided tour of the brewery with beer tasting and a typical\r\nBavarian delicacy. \r\nWe are always happy to provide any \r\nadditional information you may require.","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"v2QaKb","name":"Radler","nameDisplay":"Radler","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-10 19:01:09","updateDate":"2016-08-22 16:05:27","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

However, they quickly realized their love of baseball was more than equaled by their love of a good drink. Despite the desolate landscape of college get-togethers where there was a strong emphasis on a drink's quantity over quality, Wilson and Tommy were able to find a shared interest in the craft beer industry. When they started an alcoholic beverage company, their adventurous attitudes translated into a desire to create a product that was truly new and exciting. The result was T.W. Pitchers\u2019 Snake Bite\u00ae.\r\n\r\nWhile in college, Wilson lived in Europe and discovered that generations of British pub-goers have enjoyed blending lager and hard apple cider. He was astonished to learn the popular concoction had only sparingly made its way across the pond to the United States. Ready to undo this injustice, he returned from his trip and founded W.G. Barr Beverage Company. Tommy was brought on board, and the dynamic duo got to work bringing Snake Bite \u2013 a bottled blend of lager and cider - to the thirsty people of America. T.W. Pitchers\u2019, which stands for \"Two Williams Pitchers\u2019,\" or \"Tommy and Wilson, Pitchers,\" was immediately settled on as the brand name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of hard work and many late nights spent taste testing, Wilson and Tommy launched T.W. Pitchers\u2019 Snake Bite in San Francisco. Armed with their Airstream office, a little bit of know-how, and a whole lot of gumption, Wilson and Tommy are committed to quenching your thirst, one bottle of Snake Bite at a time.
