Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.","website":"http:\/\/www.fountainsquarebrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_o62zrw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_o62zrw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_o62zrw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_o62zrw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_o62zrw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-16 19:49:52","updateDate":"2019-06-20 18:06:57","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SD7ZRWK280","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N1ToDA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1301 Barth Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46203","phone":"317.493.1410","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday - 4pm to 9pm\r\nFriday - 4pm to 10pm\r\nSaturday - 2pm to 10pm\r\nSunday - Noon - 6pm","latitude":39.749645,"longitude":-86.140794,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-16 19:54:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday - 4pm to 9pm\r\nFriday - 4pm to 10pm\r\nSaturday - 2pm to 10pm\r\nSunday - Noon - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2JLArv","name":"Saison D\u2019\u00c9crevisses (Crawfish Season)","nameDisplay":"Saison D\u2019\u00c9crevisses (Crawfish Season)","description":"Brewing and tweaking five gallon test batches on the antiquated propane rig our brewery uses for weekend crawfish boils for inspiration, our brewmaster Gar Hatcher has crafted a biere to complement the spicy epitome of Cajun cuisine.

Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"PMzfJa","name":"Brasserie Dunham","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie Dunham","website":"http:\/\/www.brasseriedunham.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-03 15:47:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"tlmOdt","name":"Brasserie Dunham","streetAddress":"3809, rue Principale","extendedAddress":"local 104","locality":"Dunham","region":"Qu\u00e9bec","postalCode":"j0e1m0","phone":"1-450-295-1500","website":"http:\/\/www.brasseriedunham.com\/","latitude":45.1298136,"longitude":-72.8007162,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-03 15:48:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"phNNpx","name":"Saison Fran\u00e7ais \/ Belges","nameDisplay":"Saison Fran\u00e7ais \/ Belges","description":"A classic Saison fermented in two fermenters, one with French Saison yeast and one with Belgian Saison yeast.

We love beer, we love working with each other, we continually push the limits of beer and ourselves, and we grow as a profitable and sustainable company (and as individuals), without compromising our values or purpose. This passion has helped us push Allagash to the forefront of the growing Belgian beer category. We\u2019ve won countless awards for our beer (11 medals including 4 gold since 2002 at The Great American Beer Festival & 10 medals including gold & silver in 2012 since 1998 at the bi-annual World Beer Cup), and received acclaim in the press (Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Men\u2019s Journal, GQ, The Wall Street Journal and Saveur). But perhaps best of all, everyone in the Allagash family loves working here.","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:08:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"59XEKZTHLU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"hP5LHZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"50 Industrial Way","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04103","phone":"800-330-5385","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","latitude":43.703215,"longitude":-70.317677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:17:35","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mEDZEd","name":"Saison Grisette","nameDisplay":"Saison Grisette","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:08","updateDate":"2015-05-15 16:31:47","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Saison is a style that was born in the Belgian and French countryside, traditionally consumed by field laborers. We believe saisons should be dry, relatively low in alcohol, highly carbonated, and thirst quenching.    \r\nOur saisons take inspiration from Old World traditions, but also incorporate American and other New World fruit and hops. We emphasize the use of oak and fermentation with yeast and bacteria outside of traditional brewer\u2019s yeast. We use Midwestern ingredients when possible. \r\nOur individual beers are based on concepts and, like wine, will vary from batch to batch; our production is entirely manual without any automation. We believe in subtlety of flavor and that saisons are often, though not always, enhanced by a bit of lemonade or wine-like tartness, though not by outright acidity. We plan to create beers that we enjoy, and hope that our community will embrace them too.","website":"https:\/\/afterthoughtbrewing.com\/","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-31 22:04:34","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:15:45","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JO831DHQP9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8KvDqz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"844 N Ridge Ave","locality":"Lombard","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60148","latitude":41.9059189,"longitude":-88.0223174,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-11 13:10:57","updateDate":"2019-02-15 21:09:43","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IRirL7","name":"Saison Memoir","nameDisplay":"Saison Memoir","description":"This light ale is very dry, and is blended with our barrel-aged, wild-yeast fermented Saison.
