Although the farm was fully operational and proving to be a success, the goods produced were sold on mainly a wholesale level to a Grand Rapids area packing house. Beginning in, 2010, we decided to expand our business and our dream. This is where the 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation of Sietsema Orchards & Cider Mill hope to thrive and grow. We are committed to providing quality produce, and by opening our doors to the public, providing a family farm experience that we hope you enjoy here in West Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.sietsemaorchards.com\/","established":"1954","mailingListUrl":"info@sietsemaorchards.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:23:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"G9QOj4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8540 2 Mile Rd NE","locality":"Ada","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49301","hoursOfOperation":"September Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday 10am-6pm\r\nSaturday 9am-6pm\r\n\r\nOctober Hours:\r\nTuesday-Friday\r\n10am-6pm\r\nSaturday\r\n9am-6pm\r\n\r\nNovember Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday:\r\n10am-6pm\r\n\r\nSaturday:\r\n9-6","latitude":42.997611,"longitude":-85.459116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","updateDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","hoursOfOperationNotes":"September Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday 10am-6pm\r\nSaturday 9am-6pm\r\n\r\nOctober Hours:\r\nTuesday-Friday\r\n10am-6pm\r\nSaturday\r\n9am-6pm\r\n\r\nNovember Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday:\r\n10am-6pm\r\n\r\nSaturday:\r\n9-6","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Q07R9o","name":"Red Lady Ale","nameDisplay":"Red Lady Ale","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:04","updateDate":"2015-08-04 20:31:03","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"2QH9GI","name":"Carrollwood Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Carrollwood","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-30 12:55:49","updateDate":"2019-07-18 19:08:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8DVUB4TM2H","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"fYZSaX","name":"The Brass Tap","streetAddress":"10047 N.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.
