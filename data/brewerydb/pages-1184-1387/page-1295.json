These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"pzWq1r","name":"Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Jolly Pumpkin","description":"Welcome to a land of open fermentation, oak barrel aging, and bottle conditioning.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:11:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:08:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0YH75KD3FB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Zhydrx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2545 Progress Street","extendedAddress":"Suite D","locality":"Vista","region":"California","postalCode":"92081","phone":"(760) 295-0217","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","latitude":33.148172,"longitude":-117.218047,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:13:42","updateDate":"2015-08-26 16:23:19","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jnD5zy","name":"Ramble on Red","nameDisplay":"Ramble on Red","description":"A red ale with character, Ramble On Red uses the unique combination of rye malt and Belgian Special B with Challenger hops.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rKxbZ3","name":"Rambler's Red","nameDisplay":"Rambler's Red","abv":"0","ibu":"0","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-08 01:01:56","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:23:47","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"L5iqbY","name":"Rampage Imperial IPA","nameDisplay":"Rampage Imperial IPA","description":"A massive brew that is enormously aromatic with huge hop flavors wonderfully structured with a great malt body.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"RxmG5e","name":"Modern Times Beer","nameShortDisplay":"Modern Times Beer","description":"We focus (non-monogamously) on aroma-driven, complex, flavorful, sessionish beers.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.

Along the way, we\u2019ve made lots of friends and drank our unfair share of good beer, all while trying to do good in our communities and do well as a craft brewery.","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","established":"1998","mailingListUrl":"info@uplandbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:53:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8TCB25H9G6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"esM0Nc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"350 West 11th Street","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812-336-2337","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","latitude":39.1732971,"longitude":-86.5368625,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2017-10-12 13:33:14","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"E3tJa3","name":"Westside Beer Bar","streetAddress":"4060 Profile Pkwy","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812.336.2337","latitude":39.172339,"longitude":-86.586343,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","updateDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-2:00pm-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qNc7jU","name":"Carmel Tap House","streetAddress":"820 E. 116th St.","locality":"Carmel","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46032","phone":"1.317.564.3400","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/locations\/carmel-tap-house\/","latitude":39.9568182,"longitude":-86.1431514,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:10:54","updateDate":"2016-03-01 19:30:44","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ShKvsv","name":"Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"4842 North College Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46205","phone":"1.317.602.3931","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm -
