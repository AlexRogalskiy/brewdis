There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Not many examples of the style are available, especially locally, which is why we chose to brew it.  Consistent with our basic brewing philosophy, the mission for the Prime Minister is to provide north Texas with an exceptional example of the style, which may not be too familiar.  Prime Minister appears dark orange with complex fruity esters contributing to the aroma.  Its medium bodied with a malty\/caramelly sweetness.  Hop flavor is present and bitterness is light, but evident and balanced with the malt flavors present.  Fruity-ester flavors add to the character of this rich, somewhat sweet and complex beer.\r\nAs with many of our beers, this one\u2019s name comes with history.  Naming a beer isn\u2019t easy.  Iron Lady seemed the perfect  fit for an English strong due to the Margaret Thatcher reference.  However, our friends in Fort Worth, Martin House and Rahr, brew Iron Joe\/Thistle and Salty Lady, and Iron Lady seemed too close for comfort.  We settled on The Governor earlier in the year, but as the release date grew closer, we continued to conjure up hundreds of potential names.  The brewers dubbed it Large Marge (a nod to Margaret Thatcher, the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge, and PW\u2019s Big Adventure), but the strong Prime Minister ultimately won out.  The beer has one last super secret alias, but you\u2019ll have to ask Grayson about that one.\r\nWe released Prime Minister at our brewery on September 22, 2016.  Proper Baking Co. joined us and served up traditional English fare.

Two of Austin's own homebrews, Chip McElroy and Brian Peters, literally hand-built the brewery and were the two main brewers, keg washers, delivery persons, and proselytizers. Live Oak has grown since then, but we are still just as passionate about providing delicious old-world style beers that are rarely commercially available. Our special beers are brewed in limited quantities in a small east Austin brewery and are available in fine pubs and restaurants in Austin, Dallas, Houston, Alpine, Marathon, San Marcos and San Antonio.","website":"http:\/\/www.liveoakbrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZX0hI5\/upload_UFfNRk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZX0hI5\/upload_UFfNRk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZX0hI5\/upload_UFfNRk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZX0hI5\/upload_UFfNRk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZX0hI5\/upload_UFfNRk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:31:28","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WB2SZC0LXA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"AButIj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1615 Crozier Lane","locality":"Del Valle","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78617","phone":"1-512-385-2299","website":"http:\/\/www.liveoakbrewing.com\/","latitude":30.219951,"longitude":-97.6608198,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2016-07-28 19:23:32","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"it6PJh","name":"Prince","nameDisplay":"Prince","description":"Belgian Blonde.
