As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.  We also offer a large selection of canned and bottled beer, ciders and mead, along with wine and liquor.","website":"http:\/\/www.cloudsbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-06 13:38:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:37:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SBMZWF10QE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"c2Ifvu","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"126 N.

Tom\u2019s California beer-drinking youth provided him with a strong affinity for the pioneers of micro-brewing, back when Sierra Nevada, Pete\u2019s Wicked, and Mendocino Brewing were small craft brewers. Decades of drinking beer \u2013 and specifically micro-brews \u2013 have contributed to Tom\u2019s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.)

One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home brew around that time and would share his batches with the Goulets and their friends. What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:10:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PI7THDWZB4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qo6LCf","name":"Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom","streetAddress":"1621 Moore St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-827-6025","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","latitude":39.1137948,"longitude":-84.5150108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1853","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:45:48","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"X0HMO8","name":"Christian Moerlein Lager House","streetAddress":"115 Joe Nuxhall Way","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-421-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.moerleinlagerhouse.com\/","latitude":39.0963619,"longitude":-84.5087017,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:10:31","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:46:10","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-1:00pm-8:00pm,mon-11:00am-11:00pm,tue-1:00pm-8:00pm,tue-11:00am-11:00pm,wed-1:00pm-8:00pm,wed-11:00am-11:00pm,thu-1:00pm-8:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00am,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Op37K6","name":"Premium Bavaricum","nameDisplay":"Premium Bavaricum","abv":"5.1","styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-29 20:00:43","updateDate":"2016-06-02 17:30:44","style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.
