There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"ra2f4s","name":"Broken Bow Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Broken Bow","description":"At Broken Bow Brewery, Our passion towards offering our very best is deeply personal.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

An American Brewers Guild graduate in 2014, Mill House Brewing Company continually strives to create better beer, with in-house lab testing, water recipes, and house yeast strain cultivation.  They are true masters of their craft, brewing 25 uniquely different beers to date, with many more on the way!\r\nMill House Brewing Company has enjoyed much success since 2013.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"qDMDRN","name":"Picaroons Traditional Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Picaroons Traditional Ales","description":"Located in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, Picaroons Traditional Ales, brews traditional British-style ales using malted barley, hops, our signature Hampshire yeast and water.","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qDMDRN\/upload_jj1bw4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qDMDRN\/upload_jj1bw4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qDMDRN\/upload_jj1bw4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qDMDRN\/upload_jj1bw4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qDMDRN\/upload_jj1bw4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-10 16:04:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"j6zdn3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"422 Queen St.","locality":"Fredericton","region":"New Brunswick","postalCode":"E3B1B6","latitude":45.9627731,"longitude":-66.6425881,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-10 16:17:17","updateDate":"2014-10-10 16:17:17","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-10:00am-10:00pm,tue-10:00am-10:00pm,wed-10:00am-10:00pm,thu-10:00am-11:00pm,fri-10:00am-11:00pm,sat-9:00am-11:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Halifax","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
