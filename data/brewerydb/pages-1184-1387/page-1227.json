Seven different malts are employed with toasted flaked rye and rye malt standing at the forefront. Those malts provide a spicy, earthy, and decidedly biscuity flavor that is balanced against chocolate malt, midnight wheat and crisp citrus hop notes.\r\n\r\n\u201cPillar to post\u201d is an old English idiom that essentially describes an unnecessarily difficult and at-times frustrating process.

Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]\u2014 the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go. So I said, call me Trim Tab.\u201d \r\n\u2013 Buckminster Fuller (Playboy, February 1972)\r\n\r\nSmall actions - Huge positive impact.

At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.
