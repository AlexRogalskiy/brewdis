If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

The grapes are sorted and destemmed before undergoing cold maceration up to one full day. Fermentation lasts up to seven days at a carefully controlled 62.6\u00b0F, which preserves its fruity aromas. As is traditional in the C\u00f4tes de Provence, each variety is vinified separately and is then blended for ideal balance and character. Grenache lends subtle red fruit, fullness and intensity while Cinsault contributes freshness and balance to the blend.\r\n\r\nBeautiful light rose-salmon color with aromas of ripe tropical fruit, revealing accents of tangerine and hints of ginger.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

In addition, there is always at least one seasonal beer on tap to fit the mood of the season and one selection served on nitrogen.","website":"http:\/\/www.alamedabrewhouse.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"16OBTZXNR9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WDrFlD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4765 NE Fremont St","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97213","phone":"503-460-9025","website":"http:\/\/www.alamedabrewhouse.com\/","latitude":45.5484823,"longitude":-122.613645,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:05","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OTPKlF","name":"Rose City Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Rose City Red Ale","description":"Named for New Boswell's hometown, this red ale has deep red tones and a lightly floral hops aroma.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive.

The color reflects the choice of fruit. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners.

It is, however, more difficult to determine when the Framboise-Lambic appeared in the Brussels pubs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the beer certainly was available in the beginning of the 20th century. Paul Cantillon mentions a higher number of bottles of Framboise than of Kriek in his inventory for 1909-1910. During the First World War, the fruit beers disappear from the inventory. From 1922 on, the Kriek will be produced again on a regular basis. As for the Framboise, it was produced for a short time in the thirties and disappeared from the inventory afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, a friend of mine, Willy Gigounon, delivered 150 kgs of raspberries at the brewery. The production of raspberry beers started again 40 years later.\r\n\r\nI was preparing a barrel of raspberry beer. The beer coming out of the small hole in the middle of the stave was marvelous.\r\n\r\n\"It has the colour of onion skin\", said a voice behind me.\r\nIt was Raymond Coumans.\r\nHe was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), \"Raspberry-Lambic\" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a ros\u00e9, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.\r\n\r\nThe process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Ros\u00e9 de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.","abv":"5","styleId":68,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:06","updateDate":"2017-01-10 22:00:27","style":{"id":68,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","shortName":"Fruit Lambic","description":"These beers, also known by the names framboise, kriek, peche, cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit flavors and aromas.
