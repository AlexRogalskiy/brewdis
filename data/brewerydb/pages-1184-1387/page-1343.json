The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds.

Signature Brew brings them both together. Music provides the drive for making beers that are challenging, engaging and refreshing.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost we want to make beers, inspired by music, that we are proud of and love drinking. That is the beginning and end, of why we run Signature Brew, but let\u2019s fill you in on the inbetween...\r\n\r\nSignature Brew began life as a three man (Dave, Tom & Sam) crusade against the monotonous nature of the beer at all the gigs we had played, and been to, over the years. When the music on stage was a labor of love and art, we didn\u2019t want to enjoy it with passionless, uninspiring and insipid lagers.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 we began trying to change this. We spoke to a few bands we knew to see if they\u2019d be interested in brewing with us (they were), and so we set about taking our home brewing to a commercial level.\r\n\r\nThe new \u2018Signature Brew : Originals\u2019 range launched in 2014, crossing musical and beer boundaries. Taking creative control for ourselves and using our experience from the last 3 years to make beers that everyone will enjoy and appreciate.","website":"http:\/\/www.signaturebrew.co.uk\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/signaturebrew.us5.list-manage.com\/subscribe\/post?u=bd9eb29df5db1ee7ef7fe5b3b&amp;id=9ccdbc66df","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_FzGKIk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_FzGKIk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_FzGKIk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_FzGKIk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_FzGKIk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-21 13:53:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qKkgtq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Leyton Business Centre","extendedAddress":"Unit 25","locality":"London","postalCode":"E10 7BT","phone":"442076844664","latitude":51.564384,"longitude":-0.022241,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 15:37:16","updateDate":"2017-08-24 18:54:38","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"g7533U","name":"Roadie Grapefruit Radler","nameDisplay":"Roadie Grapefruit Radler","description":"ROADIE GRAPEFRUIT RADLER was named both for the road biking cyclist (roadie) and the German word for cycling (radler) and inspired by Great Divide\u2019s roots in the cycling community.

From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc\u2026) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult. \r\n\r\nOur roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.  We want to create a place to showpiece our beers, invite your friends and families, and for you all to have a great time.\r\n\r\nThe Salish Sea Brewing Company is the real deal!\r\n\r\nWe have three 10bbl fermenters in place, the 10bbl bright tank, kettle, and mash up and running!  Please join us for a beer soon.","website":"http:\/\/salishbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 04:28:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:03:26","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"FJB2P0Z8DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"RDG0mx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"518 Dayton Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 104","locality":"Edmonds","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98020","phone":"425-582-8474","hoursOfOperation":"Closed on Mondays.","latitude":47.8096929,"longitude":-122.3767578,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","updateDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-12:00pm-8:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Closed on Mondays.","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OhvSlu","name":"Roasted American","nameDisplay":"Roasted American","description":"An American Amber Ale with a pleasant roast flavor balanced by citrus from American-grown Cascade hops.","abv":"5.8","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 16:43:26","updateDate":"2014-10-03 15:57:20","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"n2527g","name":"Reuben's Brews","nameShortDisplay":"Reuben's Brews","description":"We are a small family ran brewery in the Ballard district of Seattle, crafting tasty small batch brews.\r\n\r\nOur story by grace!\r\n\r\nAlthough only a month old at the time, our clever, thoughtful son, Reuben, came up with the idea of giving Adam a homebrewing kit for his birthday.

Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"4aLH28","name":"Noon Whistle Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Noon Whistle","description":"There was a time when life was less hectic and things moved a bit slower.   Many small towns used a town whistle to let people know it was mid-day and time for a break, the whistle could be heard throughout the town. Today At Noon Whistle, we want you to take a break and enjoy yourself. \r\n\r\nMany towns still blow a Noon Whistle today. In fact, the Noon Whistle guys  grew up going on vacation to towns where that Noon Whistle sounds off. \r\n\r\nMarquette, Wisconsin is the town that  inspired the name for Paul, and the Noon Whistle  signifies tradition in his family. Not only does it symbolize  the annual trek his family takes to get away and spend time together, but It also sets the schedule  for the first  beer - no beer before the Noon Whistle. You  can hear two things happen at Noon: the Noon Whistle and the  opening of a fresh beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.noonwhistlebrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4aLH28\/upload_ovqJiK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-24 15:11:25","updateDate":"2019-06-18 18:14:50","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PQSKYM9A3N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S4gwnP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"800 E Roosevelt Rd","locality":"Lombard","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60148","website":"http:\/\/www.noonwhistlebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm","latitude":41.8621611,"longitude":-88.0006379,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-24 15:11:25","updateDate":"2017-08-22 17:20:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
