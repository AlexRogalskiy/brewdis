Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5R2O1T6ZQL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5R4Akp","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1837 North Avenue","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53083","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.773281,"longitude":-87.730762,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2017-04-20 18:09:30","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-10:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm,wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IpqiPy","name":"Roll Wit It","nameDisplay":"Roll Wit It","description":"Our twist on a traditional Belgian which features cracked coriander and fresh lemon zest.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"13","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.05","createDate":"2017-06-20 15:53:49","updateDate":"2017-06-22 17:52:08","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

We make beer because we like to drink and we like to smile.","website":"http:\/\/www.finbackbrewery.com\/","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/finbackbrewery.com\/mailinglist.html","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:09:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MQC1VWPABU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"zwemPe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7801 77th Ave.","locality":"Glendale","region":"New York","postalCode":"11385","website":"http:\/\/www.finbackbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.7065426,"longitude":-73.8731778,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-04-20 15:20:51","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yhF66w","name":"Rolling Pils","nameDisplay":"Rolling Pils","description":"Citra, Mosaic Pilsner","abv":"6","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"srmId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":174,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"very_cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Very Cold - (0-4C\/32-39F)","originalGravity":"1.058","createDate":"2019-07-07 21:37:04","updateDate":"2019-07-09 13:22:07","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":174,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Contemporary American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Contemporary American Pilsener","description":"Color: Straw to gold\r\n\r\nClarity: Appearance should be bright; chill haze should not be present\r\n\r\nPerceived Malt Aroma & Flavor: Medium-low to medium\r\n\r\nPerceived Hop Aroma & Flavor: Hop aroma and \ufb02avor is medium to high.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:12:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZUNFMATLEY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SofYHY","name":"Rolo Tony Brown Town","nameDisplay":"Rolo Tony Brown Town","abv":"10","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-12 18:18:56","updateDate":"2015-11-12 18:18:56","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

Grinding it out everyday for a fee, wearing suits and kissing butt.\r\n\r\nThen this brewery chose us...she forced us to ask ourselves, \"Is this desk job really how I pictured my life?\"  We answered that questions by taking over River Horse in 2007 and have not looked back.  We may not end up as the greatest success story on earth, but at least we had the balls to try.  Sometimes, for better or worse, your dreams get the best of you.\r\n\r\nJust remember, it's a big world out there and cubicles don't have doors, so you can walk out anytime.
