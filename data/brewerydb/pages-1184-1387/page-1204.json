Some time much further down the track they talked about starting a business together. This discussion almost certainly occurred over a beer. Doing what? The answer was right in front of them.\r\n\r\nAndy (Andrew Larsen) had already spent fourteen years in the beer industry. As a brewer and brewing consultant, his business Breowan Systems is a leading player in everything to do with brewing, and Andy works with fellow brewers all around the globe. But what Andy wanted more than anything else, more than a drive in a rally car, more than a Stratocaster, was a brewery in his hometown. Somewhere he could cruise down to on a Sunday with his daughter Katherine, lay a brew down, and listen to some Bailterspace, turned up loud.\r\n\r\nAnt (Anthony Browne) was a suit and tie wearer until 2010. As a beer drinker and lover of all good things in life, he was inevitably drawn to craft beer. After a year and a half of bumming around, some travel and a bit of study, in May 2012 Andy convinced Ant to join him for a week in Melbourne. Good Beer Week to be precise. Not much convincing was necessary. Andy showed Ant what his work in the Aussie beer industry made clear.\r\n\r\nThat restaurant menus need not be a let-down when you get to the beer list. That pubs can serve beers from little breweries, not just the big guys. And that there is a growing number of people that want more than golden lagers and brown ales. Trips to Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington followed, after which Ant was forced to admit that his beloved home-town of Auckland was missing out.\r\n\r\nSo what to do then? A brewery, certainly. But we also wanted to stock beers from all over the world, to keep discovering. And we wanted to offer the flexibility to have a beer at our place, or take some home. Preferably both :-)\r\n\r\nAfter three months planning, constructing and creating, on the 5th of December we opened the Retail Store and Beer Tasting Lounge.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 we outgrew our little brewery and opened up Juke Joint, our new mothership in Mt Eden. Home to our BBQ smokehouse and new, expanded brewery. We started bottling our beer and got it out to the best restaurants, cafes, bars and bottle shops all over Auckland.\r\n\r\nSince then we've broadened our horizons to our Barrel Room out in Orakei where we're serving up gourmet burgers and our signature range of world class beers to the good people of the Eastern Bays. Who knows what's next?","website":"http:\/\/brothersbeer.co.nz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Many Springdale beers are fermented with classic ale yeast strains, rather than our parent brewery\u2019s lager yeasts. These yeasts express themselves in our beers with spicy, fruity characteristics that are classic in many styles that we have have long loved, such as saison.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the ideal that beer needs to remain fun.

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor from yeast can be typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clovelike characteristics should not be perceived. Body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Brewer may indicate on the bottle whether the yeast should be intentionally roused or if they prefer that the entry be poured as quietly as possible.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:43:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"FLoT3g","name":"Empire Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Empire","description":"Empire Brewing Company began as a contemporary Microbrewery & Restaurant in Syracuse, New York.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"0dM1NH","name":"Almanac Beer Co","nameShortDisplay":"Almanac Beer Co","description":"Our artisanal ales are brewed in collaboration with select Northern California sustainable farms.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

The bottles are now available at both pubs and in liquor stores around the state.","website":"http:\/\/www.pubdog.net\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jPbb33\/upload_sgUoN6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jPbb33\/upload_sgUoN6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jPbb33\/upload_sgUoN6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jPbb33\/upload_sgUoN6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jPbb33\/upload_sgUoN6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:26:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VZX31O2HQS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kWJGj9","name":"Production Facility","streetAddress":"1203 New Windsor Rd","locality":"Westminster","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21158","phone":"410-848-3993","website":"http:\/\/www.pubdog.net\/","latitude":39.556366,"longitude":-77.040959,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qPlWHN","name":"Federal Hill","streetAddress":"20 East Cross Street","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21230","phone":"410-727-6077","website":"http:\/\/www.pubdog.net\/federal_hill.html","hoursOfOperation":"Daily 5:00pm - 2:00am","latitude":39.276927,"longitude":-76.613478,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 16:25:20","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Daily 5:00pm - 2:00am","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"SjUKQo","name":"Columbia","streetAddress":"8865 Stanford Boulevard","locality":"Columbia","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21045","phone":"410-872-0364","website":"http:\/\/www.pubdog.net\/columbia.html","hoursOfOperation":"Daily 11:00am - 2:00am","latitude":39.191673,"longitude":-76.817143,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 16:26:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Daily 11:00am - 2:00am","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
