We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JCKFOG","name":"Rebel Zlat\u00fd","nameDisplay":"Rebel Zlat\u00fd","abv":"4.7","styleId":76,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-17 23:18:50","updateDate":"2014-07-17 23:18:50","style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color.

That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.\r\nThanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA.

I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.

So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H05RKIPET3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
