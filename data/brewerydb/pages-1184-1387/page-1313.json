The name Gentle Ben\u2019s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington. Martha was a mean bear by people standards and had to be kept chained to a stake. The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben\u2019s Brewing Company of Tucson\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

These will just be a few of the ales we will be offering as we expand into seasonal batches, plus we just started our PRO-AM line of brews where home brewers can compete to have their recipe produced at our brewery(with the help of the creators if they desire). The winning entry will also be entered into the GABF. \r\n\r\nThanks to the help of our five distributors, we are able to get our brews to a variety of locations(including grocery stores, beverage shops, pubs and restaurants) throughout Texas and a few other states including Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and South Carolina. Unfortunately due to laws in Texas we can't tell you where you can buy our beers, but we are working at trying to get them to as many of your favorite craft beer establishments as possible.","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:26:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Z3WG95PJN1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Yr1UcD","name":"Southern Star Brewing Company","streetAddress":"3525 N Frazier","locality":"Conroe","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77303","phone":"936-441-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","latitude":30.3585757,"longitude":-95.4741966,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:45:56","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XuX9r0","name":"Red Collar","nameDisplay":"Red Collar","description":"Red Collar is a seasonal beer for the people and by the people that celebrates working Hoosiers and encourages everyone to continue writing their own story one pint at a time.","abv":"8","ibu":"73","availableId":4,"styleId":33,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XuX9r0\/upload_OrAURc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XuX9r0\/upload_OrAURc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XuX9r0\/upload_OrAURc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XuX9r0\/upload_OrAURc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XuX9r0\/upload_OrAURc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XuX9r0\/upload_OrAURc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 15:09:54","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:07:17","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":33,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial Red Ale","shortName":"Imperial Red","description":"Imperial Red Ales are deep amber to dark copper\/reddish brown.

As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves.

These flavors marry seamlessly with the apricot and peach notes from the Amarillo hops.\r\n\r\nAmber ales are a purely American creation that grew out of the craft beer renaissance that began in the early 1980s. Ambers are a beautiful balance between American pale ale-style citrusy hops and the caramelly sweetness from the addition of Crystal malts. The malts also contribute to this beer\u2019s signature amber hue.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"33","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DQyVaG\/upload_aCKU0d-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DQyVaG\/upload_aCKU0d-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DQyVaG\/upload_aCKU0d-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DQyVaG\/upload_aCKU0d-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DQyVaG\/upload_aCKU0d-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DQyVaG\/upload_aCKU0d-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"This food-friendly and versatile beer pairs well with just about anything you can cook up but is especially nice with hearty or spicy dishes.

The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.

The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

We were busy creating the same kind of crisp,refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment.
