The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:55:26","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:50:32","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"R5B3V71CJG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"EfLTd6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qz4HmX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3uZ2Ch","name":"Red","nameDisplay":"Red","description":"Do you like caramel?

In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and caf\u00e9s with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family \u2013 thus the name The 3 Brewers \u2013 \u201cthree\u201d for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare \u00e0 Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes \u2013 all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-24 14:45:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Ste-Catherine","streetAddress":"732 Ste-Catherine St. W.","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","phone":"514.788.6333","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.ca\/eng\/ste_catherine.php","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:30 -

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"wOiNxq","name":"Labatt Ontario Breweries","nameShortDisplay":"Labatt Ontario Breweries","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wOiNxq\/upload_Mzcc4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FTCwW9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Simcoe Street","locality":"London","region":"Ontario","phone":"1-519-663-5050","latitude":42.9776,"longitude":-81.248,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2017-08-29 13:39:30","timezoneId":"America\/Toronto","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PNPb0S","name":"Red","nameDisplay":"Red","description":"A hybrid of several \u201cRed\u201d beer styles, this is a malt forward beer that is crimson in color and full flavored.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.
