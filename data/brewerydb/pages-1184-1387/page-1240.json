Wine making was forever implanted into his life and who he has become today.\r\nAs an adult, he began making wine at home himself, as well as brewing his own beer and other fermented creations. This exploration of crafting his own fermented beverages brought him to his discovery of mead which took his creativity and passion by storm.\r\nToday, he has become a notable award-winning mead maker who's products have wowed even the most discerning and educated of palates. He also serves on the board of directors for the American Mead Makers Assosication and is the owner of the fastest growing meadery in the country.\r\nMelovino Meadery's gauge of success is not based on the number of awards we have won, although those are nice.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4pVaGi","name":"Pistachio Piper","nameDisplay":"Pistachio Piper","abv":"4.8","styleId":8,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 19:47:33","updateDate":"2018-06-21 14:35:30","style":{"id":8,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Heavy Ale","shortName":"Scottish Heavy","description":"Scottish heavy ale is moderate in strength and dominated by a smooth, sweet maltiness balanced with low, but perceptible, hop bitterness.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Lbf6pk","name":"Pitch Black","nameDisplay":"Pitch Black","description":"Pitch black is designed as a dark beer that any beer drinker can enjoy.

You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2\/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer. We are small but hungry\u2026we mean thirsty.","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_fZo0CC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:26:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6EMUTIVHSQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1irs0u","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"234 Carpenter Street","locality":"Greenport","region":"New York","postalCode":"11944","phone":"631-477-6681","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open for Tastings\/Growlers\/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","latitude":41.1024718,"longitude":-72.3589459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Open for Tastings\/Growlers\/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
