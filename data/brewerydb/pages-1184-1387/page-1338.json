Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"DxgfA3","name":"Bluestone Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Bluestone","website":"http:\/\/www.bluestonebrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DxgfA3\/upload_k6z0wm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DxgfA3\/upload_k6z0wm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DxgfA3\/upload_k6z0wm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DxgfA3\/upload_k6z0wm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DxgfA3\/upload_k6z0wm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-09 17:45:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:17:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KGJ1DCI2TL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eHbscK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"18 Pitney Street","locality":"Sayre","region":"Pennsylvania","latitude":41.9920953,"longitude":-76.5454947,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-09 17:45:20","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:39:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2TYVmo","name":"Rio Grande Desert Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Rio Grande Desert Pilsner","description":"A German Style Pilsner with German Yeast, German Noble Hops and 100% German Durst Malt.

Slight yeast haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"28","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"4.5","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:23:38"},"breweries":[{"id":"yrciWj","name":"Eskes Brew Pub","nameShortDisplay":"Eskes Brew Pub","website":"http:\/\/www.eskesbrewpub.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:21:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DTEHC5M2WU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"my1mFZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"106 Des Georges Lane","locality":"Taos","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87571","phone":"575-758-1517","website":"http:\/\/www.eskesbrewpub.com\/","latitude":36.4064502,"longitude":-105.5731614,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cOwbNP","name":"Rio Reserva","nameDisplay":"Rio Reserva","abv":"10.5","styleId":132,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cOwbNP\/upload_u25xtv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cOwbNP\/upload_u25xtv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cOwbNP\/upload_u25xtv-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cOwbNP\/upload_u25xtv-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cOwbNP\/upload_u25xtv-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cOwbNP\/upload_u25xtv-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-11 17:01:42","updateDate":"2017-08-30 21:39:55","style":{"id":132,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"bjwFtZ","name":"De Struise Brouwers","nameShortDisplay":"De Struise","description":"De Struise Brouwers (DSB) is a small beer company currently located in Oostvleteren, Belgium. In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-03-14 13:33:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Yz80MR","name":"Rio's Rompin' Rye Ale","nameDisplay":"Rio's Rompin' Rye Ale","description":"Think freshly baked rye bread in a bottle with just a hint of lemon and spices from the hops and yeast.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

Lift Off IPA quickly grew to become one of the best selling craft beers across Indianapolis and Indiana.

To expand we purchased a 2.0-acre site in the Speedway neighborhood of Indianapolis in February 2014.\r\n \r\nWe relocated all of our operations to the new location in May 2015. While we are most known for our flagship Lift Off IPA since relocating to the new brewery we also now distribute year round on draft and in cans our Vacation K\u00f6lsch, Muse Belgian Golden Ale, and Rip Cord Double IPA and we have a quarterly special release program with a focus on traditional German-style lagers, American IPAs and flavorful ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.daredevilbeer.com\/","established":"2012","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/daredevilbeer.us6.list-manage2.com\/subscribe\/post?u=f4573ffc5ec7c2f3411dd02df&id=57df9f998b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-24 16:17:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:51:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5E71K03ZL4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"ENh5sW","name":"Daredevil Brewing Co","streetAddress":"1151 N Main Street","locality":"Speedway","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46224","website":"http:\/\/www.daredevilbeer.com\/","latitude":39.7823784,"longitude":-86.2405797,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-24 16:18:06","updateDate":"2019-07-11 19:08:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Yxge6J","name":"Daredevil Hall","streetAddress":"2721 E 86th Street, Suite 180","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46240","phone":"317.757.2888","website":"www.daredevilbeer.com\/thehall","latitude":39.9119906,"longitude":-86.1177247,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2019","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-11 19:03:45","updateDate":"2019-07-11 19:29:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5ajrrA","name":"Rip Current","nameDisplay":"Rip Current","description":"English style IPA infused with Riptide Coffee out of Charleston SC","abv":"6.8","styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-05 20:19:09","updateDate":"2018-06-06 14:51:02","style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":4.1,"betaAcidMin":4.7,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":55.1,"humuleneMax":55.1,"caryophylleneMin":14.5,"caryophylleneMax":14.6,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":26,"myrceneMin":15.5,"myrceneMax":17.5,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":0.1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:31","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":34,"name":"Saaz (Czech)","description":"Saaz, now known as Zatec, is the name of a city noted for its hop production.

In brewing, Saaz usually refers to the hop cultivar traditionally associated with Saaz and Bohemian Pilsner.

Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American).

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-03-14 13:33:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"E5ltDf","name":"Rippa Dipa","nameDisplay":"Rippa Dipa","abv":"7.1","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E5ltDf\/upload_DfonHK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E5ltDf\/upload_DfonHK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E5ltDf\/upload_DfonHK-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E5ltDf\/upload_DfonHK-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E5ltDf\/upload_DfonHK-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/E5ltDf\/upload_DfonHK-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-20 12:48:35","updateDate":"2015-12-17 12:25:50","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

We first began experimenting with Nelson when we were brewing single hop beers for the 1st annual \u201d Wolf Among The Seas,\u201d our educational hop experience.  We really enjoyed the subtle flavors of gooseberries and sauvignon blanc grapes that characterize this hop, but because the flavors are delicate and require large amounts of hops, we thought the lighter malt bill of a session ale provided the best base on which to build this beer. Maintaining body in such a low ABV beer was very important to us, so we added a large amount of low crystals and flaked oats to our base of Pilsner malt. Nelson is a unique hop, but to avoid a finished product that was one dimensional, we rounded out the hop flavor with a small amount of Simcoe for bittering and added Amarillo and Citra to the finish and dry hop.

Can be used in any beer calling for a noble hop. Because of the poor growing characteristics of this hop, Spalt Select, a hop claimed to have similar flavor and aroma but better growing characteristics, was released by the German hop breeding program at H?ll in the 1980s, and is now grown extensively both in Spalt and in the the Hallertau.
