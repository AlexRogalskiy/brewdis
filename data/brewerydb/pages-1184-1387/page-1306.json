One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma.

Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage flavor characteristics. Their flavor is primarily derived from added flavoring rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. However,  flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers. Their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages \u2013\u00a0in the range of 4-6% alcohol by volume.","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6","createDate":"2014-07-10 14:15:20","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:43"},"breweries":[{"id":"BznahA","name":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","nameShortDisplay":"Anheuser-Busch InBev","description":"Anheuser-Busch operates 12 breweries in the United States, 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.

It didn't take long before the act, the ideas, and the processes of brewing began to take over our lives. Shortly thereafter we dubbed ourselves Black Pond Brews, after a pond where we had some fun and memorable times in Woodstock, CT. Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success. Spurred by this success and by the constant clamoring of our friends and family to make more beer, we really began to ask ourselves: how do we turn this passion for producing beer into a commercial reality?\r\n \r\nOur project is not only valuable to us, but to the community in which we will operate.  Our beautiful, quiet town of Danielson, CT will become a destination for anyone who loves beer, be they local or travellers.  Who doesn't love beer?  Further, who doesn't love MORE beer to try?!\r\n \r\nWhat inspires us?\r\nThe ability to write or create something unique, something revolutionary. Clara Barton once said \u201cI defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past\". Such a philosophy is inherent in the way we approach brewing. Breweries often spend much of their time and effort looking back to past recipes- often times as far back as the inception of brewing itself- but what of the future? What new ideas and flavors can we explore? We are always pushing the envelope against the grain- but our guiding star will always be uncompromising flavor of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackpondbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:28:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5ZRH7TLIX4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"t8ecnf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21A Furnace St","locality":"Danielson","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06239","phone":"860-207-5295","website":"http:\/\/BlackPondBrews.com","hoursOfOperation":"We are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","latitude":41.804121,"longitude":-71.883942,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:38:21","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-5:00pm-8:00pm,fri-5:00pm-8:00pm,sat-3:00pm-8:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"We are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"D9pCH0","name":"Razor Wit","nameDisplay":"Razor Wit","description":"This Belgian-style Wit, or \u201cwhite\u201d ale, is an unfiltered wheat beer brewed with traditional ingredients and a Highland twist.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category.

Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t. No matter, as you\u2019re drinking some of the best fuckin\u2019 beer made in the great state of Michigan.
