He started home brewing in 1994 after a year abroad studying Linguistics at The Braunschweig Technical University in Germany.  He actually caught the bug 5 years earlier on one of his high school exchange trips to Clauthal-Zellerfeld in Germany.  While on an excursion with the group to London, the father of the family he was staying with served him his homebrewed John Bull.  He would never forget it, but would wait to brew his own until the legal age of 21.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from the University of Oklahoma with degrees in International Business, German and Management Information Systems, he started a 16 year career in the Information Technology business that was very successful.  Many lasting relationships were formed during this time.  Many of his biggest supporters come from this IT family as well as his extended Soccer family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000 he and his wife moved to Tulsa into a home in the Renaissance neighborhood.  They quickly fell in love with its charm, character, neighbors, surrounding shops, accessibility and walkability.  He served as the neighborhood president for 4 years from 2006 through 2010 and ever since as Treasurer on the board.  There are so many things that they liked about living in this part of Midtown Tulsa that when they had kids they renovated their house versus moving to another part of town.\r\n\r\nGlenn continued to dream of becoming a professional brewer someday and was always looking to further his education in the brewing field.  In 2008 while taking a tour of a brewery in Hood River, Oregon he decided to start taking the necessary steps to make this dream a reality.  He began to read anything and everything beer related and of course brewed and brewed.  In October of 2011 the Hall\u2019s founded the Renaissance Brewing Company and purchased a dilapidated commercial property in their neighborhood at 12th and Lewis where they wanted to build the brewery building.  Tulsa\u2019s antiquated zoning laws, however, only allowed breweries in Industrial areas so they had to apply for a zoning variance.  Although this was a delay of over a year, Glenn never lost track of his vision.\r\n\r\nHe completed the Concise Course in Brewing Technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago, Ill. as well as the esteemed International Diploma Program from the World Brewing Academy which is a partnership between the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago and the Doemens Institute in Munich, Germany.  Glenn also successfully completed the Colorado Boy Brewery and Pub Immersion Course with the famous Tom Hennessy in Ridgway Colorado.  Tom will always be his mentor as well as all the other breweries that have helped along the way.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long journey and a long road still to tread, so Prost!","website":"http:\/\/www.renaissancebeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P07215MSRB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"orNo5d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1147 S Lewis Ave.","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74104","website":"www.renaissancebeer.com","latitude":36.1462265,"longitude":-95.9580406,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:52","updateDate":"2018-01-15 21:29:50","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EbGw4N","name":"Perfectly Great Amber (PGA)","nameDisplay":"Perfectly Great Amber (PGA)","description":"A marvelous, low alcohol \u201csession\u201d beer that\u2019s easy to drink with medium body and just a touch of sweetness for perfect balance.

He spent his first two years, from 1986-1988, as a brewer at McMenamins\u2019 breweries; his next four were at Deschutes, where he created the recipes for Mirror Pond, Black Butte Porter and Obsidian Stout; and John spent the next 20 years of his illustrious career as a brewmaster at Full Sail. He is now starting the next chapter with the creation of Ecliptic Brewing.","website":"http:\/\/www.eclipticbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 17:06:40","updateDate":"2019-04-25 14:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"3UI2LECMO1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"x9Ssna","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"825 N Cook Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","website":"http:\/\/eclipticbrewing.com","latitude":45.5473404,"longitude":-122.6750989,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 17:07:19","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UTC3pS","name":"Perikles","nameDisplay":"Perikles","description":"Lager brewed with oats and unmalted wheat for our bar Omnipollos hatt.","abv":"4.3","styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UTC3pS\/upload_jVYPVK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UTC3pS\/upload_jVYPVK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UTC3pS\/upload_jVYPVK-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UTC3pS\/upload_jVYPVK-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UTC3pS\/upload_jVYPVK-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/UTC3pS\/upload_jVYPVK-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-06 17:05:48","updateDate":"2019-05-06 17:06:22","style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style.

Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"osLNb3","name":"Pizza Boy Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Pizza Boy","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaboybrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 18:39:41","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:16:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYVNK0BFWM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QBZAUO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2240 Millenium Way","locality":"Enola","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17025","phone":"717-728-3840","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaboybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Wed 11 am - 10 pm\r\nThurs - Sat 11 am - 11 pm","latitude":40.2887287,"longitude":-76.9698583,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 18:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Wed 11 am - 10 pm\r\nThurs - Sat 11 am - 11 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
