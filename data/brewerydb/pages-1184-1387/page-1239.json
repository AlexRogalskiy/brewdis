The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"9","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.5","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"17","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:41"},"breweries":[{"id":"1d90Lc","name":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Ballast Point","description":"Ballast Point Brewing Company is one of San Diego's Premiere Breweries. We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"https:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:25:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TN7GC9UK6M","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sj5PSg","name":"Pippins","nameDisplay":"Pippins","description":"Juicy, expressive, and playful on the tongue, Pippins reveals why cider was North America\u2019s favourite drink before Prohibition. This aromatic off-dry cider is as robust as our pioneers and the Pippin apple trees that flourished on our frontier. Raise a glass of Sea Cider and let our apples tease your senses!\r\n\r\nThe Story: Pippins is a tribute to the pioneers that homesteaded on Vancouver Island and across North America. A \u201cpippin\u201d is an apple tree that grew from an errant seed (unlike most apple trees, which are propagated by grafting). Pippins cider reflects the story of how apple varieties developed during North America\u2019s pioneering age, when many of the Old World varieties failed to thrive, but their seeds produced a generation of new varieties. The Yellow Newton Pippin is one such apple, and the main varietal in Sea Cider\u2019s Pippins. This apple is high in both acid and sugar (important features in traditional North American cider varieties).  Pippins cider is made in the New England pre-Prohibition style, which means sharply acidic, but balanced with subtle sweetness, and high in alcohol thanks to chapitalization. Fermentation is undertaken at cool temperatures to preserve fruity aromas and to maintain the acidity. A dosage of organic cane sugar is added during fermentation to raise the level of alcohol (this was traditionally important to improve the shelf life of cider during the pioneering days).\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:\r\nAppearance: Effervescent, warm straw in colour, clear, bright.\r\nAromas, flavours: Citrus, apple, pear, lemongrass, pineapple, confectionary.\r\nAcid\/sweetness: Intense acidity, balanced by slight residual sweetness.\r\nMouthfeel: Crisp, sharp to the tongue.","abv":"9.5","styleId":154,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Truth be told, Pippins pairs well with pretty much everything!

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"VrC2d6","name":"Saugatuck Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Saugatuck","description":"The Saugatuck Brewing Company (SBC) has been a leading producer in the Michigan Craft Beer Industry since brewing its first beer in 2005.

To this day, Widmer Brothers continues to create handcrafted beers with a unique and unconventional twist on traditional styles that are award winning and please a wide range of craft beer lovers.\r\n\r\nRedhook began in a Seattle transmission shop in 1981, and those colorful roots are reflected in the brand\u2019s personality to this day. As one of the country\u2019s first craft breweries, Redhook continues to offer sessionable craft beers to consumers across the country.\r\n\r\nKona Brewing was founded in 1994 by the father and son team of Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who dreamed of crafting fresh, local island brews with spirit, passion and quality. As the largest craft brewery in Hawaii, Kona personifies the laid-back, passionate lifestyle and environmental respect of the people and culture of Hawaii.","website":"http:\/\/craftbrew.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NqX68g","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-331-7270","website":"http:\/\/craftbrewers.com\/","latitude":45.541038,"longitude":-122.6765558,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"buuCTR","name":"Cataqua Public House","streetAddress":"35 Corporate Dr","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"(603) 430-8600","website":"http:\/\/redhook.com\/","latitude":43.0861206,"longitude":-70.8044708,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-20 18:42:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"bPegqO","name":"Redhook Brewery","streetAddress":"14300 NE 145th Street","locality":"Woodinville","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98072","phone":"(425) 483-3232","website":"http:\/\/www.redhook.com","latitude":47.7348275,"longitude":-122.1488713,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-03 15:21:29","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JVtm9g","name":"Pirata","nameDisplay":"Pirata","description":"Authentic \"Deutsches Reinheitsgebot\".

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.","website":"http:\/\/skullcoastales.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_HuVGg7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kXV5lc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"802 Somerton Drive","locality":"Fort Mill","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29715","phone":"803-619-9295","latitude":35.011366,"longitude":-80.956275,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-08-25 14:13:48","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"TjzLgu","name":"Hickory Location","streetAddress":"883 Highland Ave SE","locality":"Hickory","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28602","latitude":35.735156,"longitude":-81.325672,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-20 18:52:08","updateDate":"2016-08-25 14:13:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"stlFRf","name":"Pirate Life Golden Era","nameDisplay":"Pirate Life Golden Era","description":"If it\u2019s not hops, it\u2019s hip hop.

Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.
