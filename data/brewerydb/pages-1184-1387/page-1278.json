It was a Westvleteren 12, a beer brewed by Belgian Monks. I had no idea that beer could have such complex flavors. The experience instantly changed my life and set me off on an adventure around the world in pursuit of deeper insight into global brewing cultures and techniques.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 and 2011, I worked with breweries in England, Japan and Denmark, picked hops in West Kent, and befriended brewers from around the globe. The experiences and trade secrets I picked up inspired me to start a brewery where I could bring new and innovative beers back home to the U.S. Together with my partners Brian Berge, Kevin Hilliard, and Eric Schmidt, we\u2019ve made that dream come true with Insight Brewing Company.","website":"http:\/\/www.insightbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 21:35:12","updateDate":"2019-06-25 18:41:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"36H4BQP70I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"elfZCu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2821 East Hennepin Avenue","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55413","phone":"(612) 722-7222","latitude":44.991933,"longitude":-93.21295,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 21:36:04","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:36:58","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EKKabY","name":"Pumpkin Barleywine","nameDisplay":"Pumpkin Barleywine","availableId":4,"styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-05 00:58:50","updateDate":"2013-05-05 13:39:53","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"86c3gl","name":"Willow Rock Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Willow Rock","description":"New microbrewery in Syracuse NY specializing in American style ale.","website":"http:\/\/www.willowrockbrew.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/86c3gl\/upload_XTGLUX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/86c3gl\/upload_XTGLUX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/86c3gl\/upload_XTGLUX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/86c3gl\/upload_XTGLUX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/86c3gl\/upload_XTGLUX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-22 20:42:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:57:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DZRCU30SFW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SpvENr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Game Rd.","locality":"Syracuse","region":"New York","postalCode":"13210","phone":"(315) 928-6948","latitude":43.012523,"longitude":-76.1318,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-01 18:21:46","updateDate":"2016-03-01 18:21:46","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FG321A","name":"Pumpkin Chai","nameDisplay":"Pumpkin Chai","description":"Our new fall seasonal beer; an ale brewed with herbal chai tea and pumpkin.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.
