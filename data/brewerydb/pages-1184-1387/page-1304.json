This beer is a tribute to the beer perhaps most precious ingredient, and it is a tribute to all the 'hopheads' who knows how to enjoy it. Again we have gone berserk and emptied hop room at the brewery. Amager Rated XX 2009 contains a unique composition of no less than 23 hops: Centennial, Hallertau Mittelfr\u00fch, Brewers Gold, Crystal, Simcoe, Pearl, Mt. Hood, Hersbrucker, Challenger, Fuggles, Liberty, Styrian Goldings, Columbus, Chinook, Amarillo, Bramling Cross, East Kent Goldings, Willamette, Palisade, Saaz, First Gold, Pacific Gem and Northern Brewer. Yep, we admit it outright, it's a hop-orgy that will separate the wheat from the chaff among beer lovers - even among those who have believed that their taste buds could easily cope with a violent Double IPA. When it comes to bitterness, then we have given up trying to figure it out, because it is quite impossible. But we're pretty sure that Amager Rated XX 2009, one of the world's most bitter beer.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5R2O1T6ZQL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5R4Akp","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1837 North Avenue","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53083","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.773281,"longitude":-87.730762,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2017-04-20 18:09:30","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-10:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm,wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xk99V2","name":"Rattlesnake","nameDisplay":"Rattlesnake","abv":"6.1","ibu":"100","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 14:57:26","updateDate":"2015-06-09 14:57:26","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

We feel our European style beers (hence the name Pf\u00e4lzerbr\u00e4u; \u201cBrew from the Pfalz\u201d) work very well as a premier fit in complimenting the region.\r\n\r\nTaproom Hours:\r\nMon-Wed; Closed\r\nThu-Fri; 3pm-8pm\r\nSat; 12pm-8pm\r\nSun; 1pm-6pm","website":"http:\/\/www.newpaltzbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KRPFir\/upload_fr1D8X-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KRPFir\/upload_fr1D8X-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KRPFir\/upload_fr1D8X-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KRPFir\/upload_fr1D8X-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KRPFir\/upload_fr1D8X-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-24 23:11:15","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:03:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"3UDOH0XPGT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"V7NpcA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7174 Route 209","locality":"Wawarsing","region":"New York","postalCode":"12489","website":"http:\/\/www.newpaltzbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.7511909,"longitude":-74.3629431,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-24 23:11:16","updateDate":"2017-08-22 17:19:40","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hVhvOR","name":"Rauchbier","nameDisplay":"Rauchbier","description":"A dark brown German style beer with a medium\/strong smoked malt flavor.","abv":"5.9","styleId":129,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-08 21:09:08","updateDate":"2015-04-08 21:09:08","style":{"id":129,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Smoke Beer (Lager or Ale)","shortName":"Smoke Beer","description":"Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style's character and the smoky properties.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"g6S9WB","name":"Square One Brewery & Distillery","nameShortDisplay":"Square One Brewery & Distillery","description":"The Square One Brewery & Distillery began operations as a brewery \/restaurant in February of 2006.
