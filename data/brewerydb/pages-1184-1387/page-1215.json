In the day, if you ordered an 'ale' in a British pub you got pale ale. It was preferred by the upper classes over porters, which were a distinctly working-class style. Pale ale, as well as lighter beers in general, are notoriously difficult to get 'just right' because the lighter body will show off any issues with flavors or balance.\r\n\r\nLike the musical scale, Pentatonic Pale is brewed with just five grains; wheat, oats, rye, pale malt barley, and crystal malt barley.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"cb7egM","name":"Broken Trail Brewery & Distillery","nameShortDisplay":"Broken Trail Brewery & Distillery","description":"Broken Trail - previously Distillery 365 - manufacturer of Holy Ghost Vodka, Horsethief Rum, Lone Pine Pilsner and more!","website":"http:\/\/www.brokentrailspirits.com\/","mailingListUrl":"info@distillery365.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cb7egM\/upload_bAslpQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cb7egM\/upload_bAslpQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cb7egM\/upload_bAslpQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cb7egM\/upload_bAslpQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cb7egM\/upload_bAslpQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-18 14:03:11","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:10:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P8A0C95XHR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jOAEmv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2921 Stanford Dr NE","locality":"Albuquerque","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87107","phone":"(505) 221-6281","website":"http:\/\/brokentrailspirits.com\/","latitude":35.114095,"longitude":-106.617792,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-18 14:09:34","updateDate":"2017-01-18 14:09:34","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-3:00pm-9:00pm,wed-3:00pm-9:00pm,thu-3:00pm-9:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-3:00pm-10:00pm,sun-11:00am-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GyfMoP","name":"Pepin \u201cThe Short\u201d Porter","nameDisplay":"Pepin \u201cThe Short\u201d Porter","description":"Our porter is also styled as a British style porter with a strong roasted flavor.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"ygt1Tu","name":"Paradox Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Paradox","description":"Modern brewing processes collide, headlong, into ancient beer.

Yeastgenerated fruity esters (especially banana) are appropriate at low levels. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Often bottle conditioned a slight yeast haze and flavor may be evident.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"6.25","abvMax":"7.5","srmMin":"16","srmMax":"36","ogMin":"1.06","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"Lcdy1m","name":"Three Phase Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Three Phase","description":"Three Phase Brewing Company is a start up craft brewery.

Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"Xt8My6","name":"Monkless Belgian Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Monkless Belgian Ales","description":"Our classic Belgian-style ales are crafted to be accessible, refined and smooth.
