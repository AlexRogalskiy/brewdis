Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SLrXnH","name":"Pumpkineater","nameDisplay":"Pumpkineater","description":"A high gravity pumpkin ale brewed with barley, fresh roasted pumpkin, hops, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, water and yeast, it is one of the local seasonal favorites.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
