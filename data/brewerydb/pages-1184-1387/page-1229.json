My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5R2O1T6ZQL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5R4Akp","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1837 North Avenue","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53083","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.773281,"longitude":-87.730762,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2017-04-20 18:09:30","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-10:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm,wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dNXlJH","name":"Pils","nameDisplay":"Pils","description":"This is our take of the renowned Bohemian-style pale lager that you might find in Bavaria or the Czech Republic.

Due to market demand we reached capacity at our original production-only brewery on the southeast side of Indianapolis in mid-2013. To expand we purchased a 2.0-acre site in the Speedway neighborhood of Indianapolis in February 2014.\r\n \r\nWe relocated all of our operations to the new location in May 2015. While we are most known for our flagship Lift Off IPA since relocating to the new brewery we also now distribute year round on draft and in cans our Vacation K\u00f6lsch, Muse Belgian Golden Ale, and Rip Cord Double IPA and we have a quarterly special release program with a focus on traditional German-style lagers, American IPAs and flavorful ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.daredevilbeer.com\/","established":"2012","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/daredevilbeer.us6.list-manage2.com\/subscribe\/post?u=f4573ffc5ec7c2f3411dd02df&id=57df9f998b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-24 16:17:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:51:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5E71K03ZL4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"ENh5sW","name":"Daredevil Brewing Co","streetAddress":"1151 N Main Street","locality":"Speedway","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46224","website":"http:\/\/www.daredevilbeer.com\/","latitude":39.7823784,"longitude":-86.2405797,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-24 16:18:06","updateDate":"2019-07-11 19:08:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Yxge6J","name":"Daredevil Hall","streetAddress":"2721 E 86th Street, Suite 180","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46240","phone":"317.757.2888","website":"www.daredevilbeer.com\/thehall","latitude":39.9119906,"longitude":-86.1177247,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2019","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-11 19:03:45","updateDate":"2019-07-11 19:29:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9ESz26","name":"Pils","nameDisplay":"Pils","description":"A Northern German style Pilsner, which translates to a dry, crisp beer with a strong floral bitterness.","abv":"5","availableId":1,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-28 17:44:41","updateDate":"2015-02-28 17:58:38","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
