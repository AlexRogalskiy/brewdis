If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery.

The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:40:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M8ICS1LEDY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wbpj5b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3912 W McLean Ave","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60647","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.9180876,"longitude":-87.7260612,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-06-16 17:16:46","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EIeyoN","name":"Saison Sauvin","nameDisplay":"Saison Sauvin","description":"Saisons have been around for ages. Traditionally brewed by Belgian and French farmers to provide refreshment during harvest. I'm guessing that flavour wasn't a main concern back then; the priority was to provide a beverage that was safe to drink, because water usually wasn't. Never the less, over time they developed a beverage chrarissed by beer geeks of the modern world. The alcohol content was low, so the workers could consume enough to keep hydrated and still perform their job: To load the barn with enough barley for next years brewing season. I bet these hardworking, humble farmers never imagined, that centuries later, their style of brewing would inspire brewers from all over the world. As all our beers, this is a very modern, you might say new world, interpretation of this style. Based on the tradition we have used a French Saison yeast, which provides a plethora of funky, earthy, very \"Belgian\" flavours. From there we have upped the ante a fair bit by doubling the amount of malt, and thereby the alcohol, and loaded the kettle with punchy Nelson Sauvin hops. Unlike the original, this is not a beer meant to be drunk by the gallon. Moderation is the key for full enjoyment of all great beers.","abv":"7","ibu":"50","glasswareId":5,"srmId":6,"availableId":1,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-17 21:46:48","updateDate":"2018-05-01 12:33:21","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
