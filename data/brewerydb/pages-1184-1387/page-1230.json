You see, this was the day that the first three beers brewed on site flowed. We know we are biased, but in our minds the beer had never tasted as good as it did that day. Our brew master is the \u201cBig German\u201d Uwe Boer that we all know and love. He works magic in his craft and the passion that he shows for brewing fills the glasses as his award winning beer dispenses from our taps. We now boast our own regular taps but his innovation in our seasonal ales and distinct brewing style is what keeps our bar stools full and the place hopping. We can hardly keep his cask conditioned ale on tap as our customers are known to consume the kegs in record time.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat Beer, Great Food and Great Service\u201d became our motto as we plugged through the first few years and now the slogan is what we live by. Our fantastic customers and great staff are what makes us who we are and how we stand out in the sea of new restaurants that pop up daily. It is our great customers that made it so easy to push forward into brewing and our loyal staff that helped to smooth over the transition. We continue to grow and change over time just as any business wants to do but it is remembering the little things that have gotten us to where we are today. After all in today\u2019s crazy hectic world it is the little things in life that make it all worth it.","website":"http:\/\/sunup.beer\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:32","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"XMNU2SAIBK","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"nnn6Sq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"322 East Camelback Road","locality":"Phoenix","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"85012","phone":"(602) 279-8909","website":"http:\/\/www.sunupbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday 11:00am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday and Saturday to Midnight\r\nHappy Hour: 3:00 - 6:00 PM Daily","latitude":33.509286,"longitude":-112.068897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday 11:00am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday and Saturday to Midnight\r\nHappy Hour: 3:00 - 6:00 PM Daily","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hjo7iE","name":"Pilsener","nameDisplay":"Pilsener","description":"A Bohemian Style Pilsener loaded with the noble flavor of Czech Saaz hops.

According to German criteria for a true pilsener, however, the vast majority of them would be unrecognizable as such. By this definition, a pilsener is a lager beer with a light golden color (5-8 color units by European Brewers' Convention standards), a specific gravity in the 11.5-12.5% Plato range, and a hops content of at least 28 EBUs (European Bitter Units). Most so-called domestic \"pilseners\" fall far short in these categories; Bayern Pilsener easily meets all three (6 color units, 12% Plato, 34 EBUs).\r\n\r\n What does all this technical jargon mean? It means you have purchased one of the very few authenic pilseners brewed in America. Reward yourself by enjoying this beer the way it was meant to be served: pour your cold Bayern Pilsener, in two or three slow steps, into the center of your glass (a fluted or \"tulip\" glass works best). The thick creamy head (the German term for this is \"crown\") and you have just created the mark of a classic Bavarian pilsener. It is functional, too - the crown holds finely distributed natural carbonation inside the glass and acts as a shelter for this beer's distintive, hoppy flavor.","abv":"5","ibu":"32","srmId":6,"availableId":1,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.048","createDate":"2015-05-20 18:48:07","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:16:03","srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:57:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2T1Q06HRXP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qYXUw8","name":"Pilsener","nameDisplay":"Pilsener","abv":"5.1","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-08 21:03:29","updateDate":"2015-04-08 21:03:29","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-09 19:06:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TJCONK5EHD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5tw2Iw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"216 S Alameda St","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90013","phone":"310-329-8881","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","latitude":34.0466054,"longitude":-118.2378181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1KzY9i","name":"Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Pilsner","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:21:32","updateDate":"2017-09-06 15:51:25","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.
