Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"qlwwem","name":"Spiteful Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Spiteful","description":"We are a Chicago nanobrewery committed to brewing proper beer and delivering it to Chicagoans one case at a time.

Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"E3BHII","name":"Reformation Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Reformation","description":"We believe beer is a good gift and should be free from fear, noise, and neglect. #setbeerfree","website":"http:\/\/www.reformationbrewery.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E3BHII\/upload_AnQQZt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E3BHII\/upload_AnQQZt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E3BHII\/upload_AnQQZt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E3BHII\/upload_AnQQZt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E3BHII\/upload_AnQQZt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:00:40","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SXYTE62P39","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"OsDwRF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"500 Arnold Mill Way","extendedAddress":"Ste A","locality":"Woodstock","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30188","phone":"678-341-0828","website":"http:\/\/www.reformationbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.1019841,"longitude":-84.5054434,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2017-06-14 15:32:51","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1Q0NXF","name":"Providence","nameDisplay":"Providence","description":"This is a dry, spicy thirst quenching brew.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....\r\n \r\nJosh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.\r\nJosh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   \r\nFast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  \r\n\r\nMany weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  \r\n\r\nGoodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, \"I'm coming over to your house.\"  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  \"Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.\" \r\n\r\nJosh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. \r\n\r\nOne week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was\r\na hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!\r\n \r\nNow that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours. No matter what the occasion, visiting The Public House Brewery is always an extraordinary experience.  \r\n \r\nThe team at Public House looks forward to welcoming you!","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-12-18 19:07:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5SH064IZ1R","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"e0v4NA","name":"Rolla Brewpub","streetAddress":"600 North Rolla Street","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Rolla","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65401","phone":"573-426-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","latitude":37.9489305,"longitude":-91.7721244,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:44:16","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Dch3p7","name":"Public House Brewing Company","streetAddress":"551 State Route B","locality":"St. James","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65559","phone":"573-261-3333","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com","latitude":38.009672,"longitude":-91.6072769,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-27 16:11:23","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:05:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-7:00pm,mon-11:00am-7:00pm,tue-11:00am-7:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3f4300","name":"Provo Girl","nameDisplay":"Provo Girl","description":"She's hung up the lederhosen, but Provo Girl is still the spaetzle to our schnitzel.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"j2NSPm","name":"Psychedelic Lines","nameDisplay":"Psychedelic Lines","abv":"7.5","styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-13 13:44:39","updateDate":"2017-06-13 13:44:39","style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"zMORP4","name":"Odyssey Beerwerks","nameShortDisplay":"Odyssey Beerwerks","description":"Back when the world was a much different place, filled with grunge music, loose fitting clothes, and Wayne\u2019s World movies, two shady characters fell in together and started doing various sketch and wonderful things. One of these was brewing . . . beer. Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today\u2019s market, but the goofy and \u201cjust OK\u201d beers that home brewers in the 90\u2019s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we\u2019ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity\u2019s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.\r\n\r\nChris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OdysseyBeerwerks\/app_100265896690345","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:24:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:41:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KFRB2G1TQ7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"I4hZZy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5535 W 56th Ave,","extendedAddress":"Suite 107","locality":"Arvada","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80002","phone":"(303) 421-0772","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","latitude":39.8007911,"longitude":-105.0589359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:42:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dk97NY","name":"Psychokinesis","nameDisplay":"Psychokinesis","description":"Hazy golden wild farmhouse ale, dry hopped with Mosaic, El Dorado, and Jarrylo.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"laNl6e","name":"Grimm Artisanal Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Grimm Artisanal Ales","description":"Our beers are artisanal and often Belgian-inspired. We aim to create elegant ales that are experimental and unique, balanced with complex flavors and aromas. From the recipes to the artwork on the labels, everything is designed by ourselves and our good friends.\r\n\r\nGypsy brewing means we are brewers without a permanent brewing home. We travel to other breweries, use their equipment to make something special, and bring the results back home to share. Think of Grimm Ales as a band, and the host brewery as a recording studio. We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).\r\n\r\nEach batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!\r\n\r\nExpect our first beers to pop up in New York in summer 2013. Some of our first batches might be a crisp, spicy rye abbey ale, a rich, golden Belgian tripel, and a hop-focused pale ale made with clean, slightly acidic champagne yeast.","website":"http:\/\/grimmales.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/laNl6e\/upload_46Qm25-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 13:04:26","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:12:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U8CLHEZ0RV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TIn5vy","name":"Main Office","extendedAddress":"PO Box 150472","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11215","phone":"(678) 895-1489","website":"http:\/\/grimmales.com\/","latitude":40.6681669,"longitude":-73.9800645,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 13:05:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
