Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:27:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"1pIlxx","name":"Generations Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Generations","description":"We can't thank everyone enough for the amazing support over the last few months and are so excited to see what's to come!

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-12-14 21:09:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JS9DRET054","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vcD8aT","name":"Pride & Joy","nameDisplay":"Pride & Joy","description":"Our Pride & Joy is pale, crisp, very hoppy and aromatic.

It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put up\" a dozen people from \"the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.\r\n\r\nGrandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.","website":"http:\/\/www.cooperstownbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_cV0QXa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2019-03-15 19:06:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PTODAYWX16","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hG1G1v","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"110 River Street","extendedAddress":"P.O.

IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing. This brewery celebrates determination, knowledge, and the humble pride we wave like a battle flag.","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonBrewingCompany\/app_100265896690345?ref=page_internal","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:09:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:36:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"G851P7EZKA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"JZyJiP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 W. 7th","locality":"Covington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41011","phone":"859-261-5600","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","latitude":39.0829077,"longitude":-84.5109181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 17:33:55","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:29:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LgDR9B","name":"Braxton Labs","streetAddress":"95 Riviera Dr.","locality":"Bellevue","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41073","phone":"859-291-0036","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonLabs\/","latitude":39.1001948,"longitude":-84.4877355,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","updateDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bzPxPe","name":"Priebe Porter","nameDisplay":"Priebe Porter","description":"To The Wizard of Water, The Master of Mash, The Baron of Barley, and Kingpin of Craft.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"1WSZAu","name":"Brauhaus Zwickau","nameShortDisplay":"Brauhaus Zwickau","website":"http:\/\/www.brauhaus-zwickau.de\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1D8Zd9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Peter-Breuer-stra\u00dfe 12","locality":"Zwickau","region":"Sachsen","postalCode":"08056","latitude":50.717146,"longitude":12.4945919,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:20","updateDate":"2017-08-28 14:34:31","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ic5C4I","name":"Priester Hell","nameDisplay":"Priester Hell","abv":"5.4","styleId":79,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:21:11","updateDate":"2012-08-19 13:41:39","style":{"id":79,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Dortmunder \/ European-Style Export","shortName":"Dortmunder","description":"Dortmunder has medium hop bitterness.
