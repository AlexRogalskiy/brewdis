Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style export ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style export ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style export ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"9FwufS","name":"Port City Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Port City","description":"The historic port city of Alexandria, VA has a proud tradition of brewing beer for the region that dates back to the 19th century. \r\n\r\nPort City Brewing Company is proud to revive, celebrate and continue this rich brewing history in our modern artisanal brewery right outside of our Nation\u2019s Capital.  \r\n\r\nNamed Small Brewery of the Year at the 2015 Great American Beer Festival, we proudly brew world class quality beers for the DC and Mid Atlantic market..\r\nOur mission is to be a reliable and innovative regional brewer of top quality beers that are delicious and well balanced, made from the finest ingredients available, and which celebrate their raw materials.","website":"http:\/\/www.portcitybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.portcitybrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9FwufS\/upload_NLWZS5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9FwufS\/upload_NLWZS5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9FwufS\/upload_NLWZS5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9FwufS\/upload_NLWZS5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9FwufS\/upload_NLWZS5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:32:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"38FTG792PZ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"imxbxX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3950 Wheeler Avenue","locality":"Alexandria","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22304","phone":"703-797-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.portcitybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday 5\u20138p.m.\r\nThursday 5\u20138p.m.\r\nFriday 3\u20139p.m. TOURS AT 6:30PM\r\nSaturday 12\u20139 p.m. TOURS AT 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 5:00 & 6:00 PM\r\nSunday 12\u20136p.m. TOURS AT 2:00 & 3:00 PM","latitude":38.808003,"longitude":-77.101365,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wednesday 5\u20138p.m.\r\nThursday 5\u20138p.m.\r\nFriday 3\u20139p.m. TOURS AT 6:30PM\r\nSaturday 12\u20139 p.m. TOURS AT 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 5:00 & 6:00 PM\r\nSunday 12\u20136p.m. TOURS AT 2:00 & 3:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jln1QS","name":"Port Clinton Porter","nameDisplay":"Port Clinton Porter","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:59","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:51","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
