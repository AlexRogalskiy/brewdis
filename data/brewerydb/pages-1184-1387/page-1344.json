Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"1hCGDj","name":"Claremont Craft Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Claremont Craft Ales","description":"Located in eastern Los Angeles County in a picturesque college town, Claremont Craft Ales is dedicated to bringing premium hand-crafted ales to the local community.

There, we produce about 600 barrels per year, including all of the company's barrel-aged and cask-conditioned ales. We opened Downers Grove in 2004 and brew on a 15 barrel Specific Mechanical system to make about 850 barrels per year. The 10 barrel DME system at Palatine is our newest brewery and is also the home of our bottle and draft packaging operations. Our beer can be found in chain and independent retail stores, bars, and restaurants throughout the Chicago-land area.","website":"http:\/\/www.emmettsbrewingco.com","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/13MS5k\/upload_iDSSYH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:21:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"70CEINUA3P","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"WCBdy2","name":"Emmett's Tavern & Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"128 West Main Street","locality":"West Dundee","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60118","phone":"847-428-4500","website":"http:\/\/www.emmettstavern.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday-Thursday: 11:30am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday\/Saturday: 11:30am - 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11:30am - 9:00pm","latitude":42.0982603,"longitude":-88.2784071,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:35:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday-Thursday: 11:30am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday\/Saturday: 11:30am - 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11:30am - 9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"jln1QS","name":"Emmett's Ale House","streetAddress":"5200 Main Street","locality":"Downers Grove","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60515","phone":"630-434-8500","website":"http:\/\/www.emmettstavern.com\/","latitude":41.7925318,"longitude":-88.0105302,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2016-04-29 15:24:05","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"T2KXDr","name":"Emmett's Tavern & Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"110 N.
