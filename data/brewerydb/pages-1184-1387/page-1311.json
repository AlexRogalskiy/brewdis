It was founded on the idea that great beer doesn\u2019t have to be complicated and good beer should be enjoyable. We are also focused on bringing sessionable craft beer to everyone. The biggest trend, and subsequent impediment, in craft\/micro brewing is the almost obsessive need to make the biggest, hoppiest, strangest beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\r\n\r\nAnother of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open. So, with this in mind, we will share as many of our \u201csecrets\u201d as possible with everyone so that they too can make great beer at home.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.","website":"http:\/\/www.nwpeaksbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"PG4ybp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4912 17th Avenue Northwest","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"206-853-0525","latitude":47.664834,"longitude":-122.378656,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zwcD2Q","name":"Red Alt","nameDisplay":"Red Alt","description":"Our take on a German style alt bier.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.
