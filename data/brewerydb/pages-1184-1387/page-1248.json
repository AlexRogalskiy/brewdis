Not this time around.\r\n \r\nA brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family\u2019s, employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery\u2026Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.\r\n \r\nCan true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man\u2019s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to\u2026A madman\u2019s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.\r\n \r\nTrue patrons know how to accept the obscure humor.

Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ll00zf","name":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jackie O's","description":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery prides itself in creating neo-traditional handcrafted artisan ales.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

After entering and winning their first formal homebrewing contest in 2012, the group continued to refine their recipes and hired its first full-time brewmaster in 2014. In 2015 a vacant Rock Hill, SC car dealership was purchased and converted into a craft brewery and brewpub.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"igHAmp","name":"Central State Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Central State","description":"Central State explores the delicate art of yeast interaction and cultivation in an experimental process as a third wave brewery dedicating themselves to 100% Brett brewing.\r\n\r\nFounded by a technically-minded team with an experienced brewer, Central State aims to contribute to the innovation and knowledge-sharing culture that has defined this new generation of American brewing through experimentation, collaboration, and artisanal gypsy brewing.\r\n\r\nCentral State Brewing Co. is part of a renaissance of craft-minded producers helping revitalize small and mid-size cities across the midwest, sharing their inventiveness with small pockets of like-minded drinkers across the country who are looking for unique flavors and textures in their beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.centralstatebrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igHAmp\/upload_DXpIvE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igHAmp\/upload_DXpIvE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igHAmp\/upload_DXpIvE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igHAmp\/upload_DXpIvE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igHAmp\/upload_DXpIvE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-05 12:13:18","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:14:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RSZDKU07TB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"15GJPy","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Indiana","website":"http:\/\/www.centralstatebrewing.com\/","latitude":40.2671941,"longitude":-86.1349019,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-05 12:13:51","updateDate":"2014-09-05 12:13:51","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lR1ZG7","name":"Polypin Best Bitter","nameDisplay":"Polypin Best Bitter","description":"Having a wedding, party or celebration?

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"l726np","name":"Short Fuse Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Short Fuse","description":"Located in the Village of Schiller Park, Illinois, Short Fuse Brewing Company is a production brewery and taproom with a full kitchen.

We strive to bring an authentic and pleasant experience to all of our customers through our unique ales and lagers.","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","established":"1985","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ORN90Y51W8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"NnffJ2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8938 Krum Ave.","locality":"Galesburg","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49053","phone":"269-382-2338","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","latitude":42.2843486,"longitude":-85.4538497,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1985","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-25 20:15:04","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"uCUre7","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E Kalamazoo Ave","locality":"Kalamazoo","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49007","website":"http:\/\/bellsbeer.com\/eccentric-cafe\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","latitude":42.2949613,"longitude":-85.5789817,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-26 11:44:59","updateDate":"2015-05-06 15:19:37","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Y0IatW","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E.
