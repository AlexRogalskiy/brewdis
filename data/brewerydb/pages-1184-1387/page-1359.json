The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"3vJdrg","name":"Witch's Hat Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Witch's Hat","description":"Our little family started at the Witch's Hat in South Lyon in 2007 when we said \"I do\".

(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.

To mark these events we have brewed a 'right royal brew', Theakston Royal Salute.

It is hop-forward with a balance towards late hop additions and bitterness, yet this medium-bodied brew maintains an ample malt foundation on the way to a smooth, refreshing finish.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"36","glasswareId":5,"styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/58gT1s\/upload_rOdxvg-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pale ales are great beers to pair with a wide variety of foods.

The Peace Tree is a historic grand sycamore tree that was located near the town of Red Rock under what is now Lake Red Rock. Supposedly the old sycamore was a place where Indians met for generations, then became a meeting place for fur traders. Indian treaties were negotiated here and there is some speculation that it marks the Red Rock Line.","website":"http:\/\/www.peacetreebrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zOXpwx\/upload_J6M9GC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zOXpwx\/upload_J6M9GC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zOXpwx\/upload_J6M9GC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zOXpwx\/upload_J6M9GC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zOXpwx\/upload_J6M9GC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:32:57","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1S0AZ9R5TX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"h9obbv","name":"Knoxville Taproom","streetAddress":"107 W Main Street","locality":"Knoxville","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50138","phone":"641-842-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.peacetreebrewing.com\/","latitude":41.3189315,"longitude":-93.098861,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-03-31 14:25:31","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"UYn6Ol","name":"Des Moines Branch","streetAddress":"317 E.

Many worth sharing over a beer. Most involving beer. Some even worth sharing on a beer label. The original story finds these three forming an ad hoc craft beer revolution coalition in 2003 called Brewers United for Freedom of Flavor (BUFF), which eventually leads to the first release of this hellaciously herbaceous beer in 2010. The breweries are still taking turns brewing it, but this Berlin-brewed version is different. While we wouldn\u2019t abandon our standards of using locally sourced herbs, and dry-hopping the beer with Citra hops to complement those botanical flavors and aromas, this time we imperialized the recipe to make it even more worthy of an epic, fine feast.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

When The Royale of South City fame contacted us about brewing up a batch of beer for them it was an easy decision.  They even had a style in mind - Kolsch.  Kolsch proper is a blond-colored Ale brewed in the city of Koln.  It is then stored (lagered) for some time to mellow the brew and in many aspects it resembles its lager brothers and sisters.  Mike and I worked with Jon on the recipe keeping the Kolsch philosophy- sprinkled a few more hops in- and I think the end result is pretty darn good.  Bier Royale checks in at 5%, was built from Pale Ale, Pils, Vienna, and Wheat malts, and spiced with Hops from Tettnang which give it that 35 IBU bedonkedonk.  Cheers!  Prost!

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.
