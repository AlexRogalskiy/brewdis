The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.\r\n \r\nWe host 3 annual events, The Virginia Herb Festival (June), BRB Hop Harvest Party (August) and BRB Holiday Market (November). \r\n \r\nYou are cordially invited to come and drink our beer, eat, play and spend some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.backroombreweryva.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:40:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EZKWH4V13N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"CEon99","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Ridgemont Rd.","locality":"Middletown","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22645","phone":"540-869-8482","latitude":38.9956004,"longitude":-78.2210269,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:28:31","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eD2GcH","name":"Peter Peter Pumpkin Pleaser","nameDisplay":"Peter Peter Pumpkin Pleaser","description":"A sweet and spicy seasonal pumpkin mash.","availableId":4,"styleId":121,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-24 16:34:16","updateDate":"2015-02-24 16:34:16","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":121,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pumpkin Beer","shortName":"Pumpkin Beer","description":"Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.

We emphasize the use of oak and fermentation with yeast and bacteria outside of traditional brewer\u2019s yeast. We use Midwestern ingredients when possible. \r\nOur individual beers are based on concepts and, like wine, will vary from batch to batch; our production is entirely manual without any automation. We believe in subtlety of flavor and that saisons are often, though not always, enhanced by a bit of lemonade or wine-like tartness, though not by outright acidity.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"umlCeh","name":"Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Stave","description":"Crooked Stave is a progressive, artisan brewery that strives to blend brewing science and art, through creativity and following our passion.

At first glance the densely opaque violet appearance of the beer hints at a potential fruity potpourri, however; Petit Verdot proves to be more than the uninspired fruity beers being pushed down your throats like bad pop music. Utilizing a grape that most often makes up smaller percentages of wine blends in France, we extract massive leathery notes, hints of tobacco, heavy beats of beets, delicate tannins, jammy notes of raspberries and boysenberries, and then finally a very effervescent cranberry-like finish. A small mountain of French sea salt aids in turning the volume up on the intricate Petit Verdot grape profile and bridging it to the beer's tart and sour base. Petit Verdot Grand Gose is a rare breed; bright and refreshing on its finish making it easy to throw back pints repeatedly, but also a wealth of complexity that can be slowly sipped and analyzed as if you were studying for your Sommelier exam.","abv":"6.7","styleId":165,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-03-05 08:33:06","updateDate":"2017-03-06 20:05:10","style":{"id":165,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Contemporary Gose","shortName":"Contemporary Gose","description":"Contemporary Goses are straw to medium amber, or, may take on the hue of added fruits or other ingredients if present.

Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived.

Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.
