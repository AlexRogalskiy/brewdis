Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"6QNMyS","name":"Laht Neppur Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Laht Neppur","description":"We couldn't have said it better ourselves.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Jt43j7","name":"New Belgium Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"New Belgium","description":"We'll set the scene: 1989.

More than 150 years later, the Stevens Point Brewery continues to successfully brew quality beer, just as the brewery\u2019s founders, Frank Wahle and George Ruder, did in 1857. This undeniable endurance is a testament of why the Stevens Point Brewery, in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, is the 5th oldest continuously operating brewery remaining in the United States. Today, the Stevens Point Brewery is proud to be Wisconsin-owned and independently operated.","website":"http:\/\/www.pointbeer.com\/","established":"1857","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001QOqrPM3hRDN-5KgIao1mCQ==","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:46:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CWHSXVG175","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"54skNQ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2617 Water Street","locality":"Stevens Point","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54481","phone":"715-344-9310","website":"http:\/\/www.pointbeer.com\/","latitude":44.5104,"longitude":-89.5734,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rasWSc","name":"Peach Mango Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Peach Mango Pale Ale","description":"Appearance: Hazy Straw Color, White Lacing Foam \r\nAroma: Peach, Grapefruit, Lime Rind, Citrus\r\nTaste: Mild Bitterness, Peach, Mild Mango Finish\r\nMouthfeel: Light body, Medium Effervescence \r\nMalts: 2-Row, White Wheat\r\nHops: Simcoe, Citra\r\nAdditions: Peach and Mango Puree","abv":"6.2","ibu":"33","availableId":1,"styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-09 21:17:50","updateDate":"2019-07-10 14:40:42","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"rKXfsB","name":"Burley Oak Craft Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Burley Oak Craft","description":"Hi there!

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's.
