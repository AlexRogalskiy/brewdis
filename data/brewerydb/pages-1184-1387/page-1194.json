Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level. We serve local bars, restaurants, and retail outlets and have five and fifteen-gallon kegs and 22-ounce bottles available for weddings, caterers, as well as for thirsty individuals that happen to come our way.

After their military tour, Scott and Cyndi returned to Florida, where they met in college, and Scott\u2019s love of home-brewing was first kindled.","website":"http:\/\/www.onobrewco.com","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6FO8hy\/upload_vFsnsx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6FO8hy\/upload_vFsnsx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6FO8hy\/upload_vFsnsx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6FO8hy\/upload_vFsnsx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6FO8hy\/upload_vFsnsx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-25 18:54:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:54:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"63I2U4JR1K","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QM3KJY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4520 Daly Dr","extendedAddress":"Suite 102","locality":"Chantilly","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20151","phone":"571-409-6662","website":"www.onobrewco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Business hours:\r\nTues Odd BQQ closes 8:30pm\r\nWed Odd BQQ closes 8:30pm\r\nThurs Odd BQQ closes 8:30pm\r\nFri Odd BQQ closes 9pm\r\nSat Odd BQQ closes 9pm\r\nSun Odd BQQ closes 5:30pm","latitude":38.8834013,"longitude":-77.4444905,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-28 20:57:21","updateDate":"2018-06-28 20:57:21","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-3:00pm-9:00pm,fri-12:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm,tue-3:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Business hours:\r\nTues Odd BQQ closes 8:30pm\r\nWed Odd BQQ closes 8:30pm\r\nThurs Odd BQQ closes 8:30pm\r\nFri Odd BQQ closes 9pm\r\nSat Odd BQQ closes 9pm\r\nSun Odd BQQ closes 5:30pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WvyZIM","name":"Paradise Porter","nameDisplay":"Paradise Porter","description":"Malt Varieties - 2 Row Pale, Caramel 80, Chocolate Malt, Black Malt\r\nHop Varieties - Amarillo, Glacier","abv":"4.99","ibu":"38","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/WvyZIM\/upload_wA7TFp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/WvyZIM\/upload_wA7TFp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/WvyZIM\/upload_wA7TFp-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/WvyZIM\/upload_wA7TFp-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/WvyZIM\/upload_wA7TFp-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/WvyZIM\/upload_wA7TFp-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:55","updateDate":"2015-12-16 13:53:11","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Diamond Bear is brewed in Arkansas which is the only state to have a diamond mine. This is where the first part of our name came from.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"wfAwfx","name":"BrewDog","nameShortDisplay":"BrewDog","description":"BrewDog is a Scottish craft brewery located in the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBrewDog was founded in 2006 by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.
