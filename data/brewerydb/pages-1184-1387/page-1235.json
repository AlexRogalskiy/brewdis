Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"DPLTAJ","name":"Terrapin Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Terrapin","description":"Terrapin Beer Company was born when two brewers met while working together at a microbrewery in Atlanta.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

See our Farm Plan 2014 and read about the barley, hops, strawberries, pumpkins and the upcoming new additions of figs trees, blueberries, herbs, sunflowers, additional pumpkin terraced fields and a hardy orange tree grove.  Farmer Russell has ordered our new additions and will be breaking ground this February. We operate on a beautiful working farm in the heart of Virginia.\r\n\r\nLickinghole Creek is a water-conscious brewery.  We brew with well water drawn from the deep.  Our wastewater is purified on site and returned to the Lickinghole Creek watershed.\r\n\r\nOur name pays homage to Little Lickinghole Creek, which runs through the farm\u2019s rolling hills.  Since precolonial times the creek has been known as the Lickinghole where wildlife stopped to drink from the nourishing waters.  May the tradition continue.","website":"http:\/\/www.lickingholecreek.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xqduVv\/upload_YX5SKh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xqduVv\/upload_YX5SKh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xqduVv\/upload_YX5SKh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xqduVv\/upload_YX5SKh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xqduVv\/upload_YX5SKh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:37:34","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:50","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7DR4E5CUH0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"6hXxyK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4100 Knolls Point Dr.","locality":"Goochland","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23063","phone":"(804) 314-4380","website":"http:\/\/www.lickingholecreek.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3:00 p.m. \u2013 7:00 p.m.\r\nSaturdays 12:00 p.m. \u2013 7:00 p.m.\r\nSundays 12:00 p.m. \u2013 7:00 p.m.","latitude":37.7433012,"longitude":-78.0091136,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:37:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fridays 3:00 p.m. \u2013 7:00 p.m.\r\nSaturdays 12:00 p.m. \u2013 7:00 p.m.\r\nSundays 12:00 p.m. \u2013 7:00 p.m.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KA8EHv","name":"Pineapple Orange Hop","nameDisplay":"Pineapple Orange Hop","abv":"6","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 19:24:13","updateDate":"2018-06-05 18:10:41","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
