Malt character is more reminiscent of fresh and lightly toasted Munich- style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt character. Some elements of caramel and toffee can be evident and contribute to complexity, but the predominant malt character is an expression of toasted barley malt. Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Diamond Bear is brewed in Arkansas which is the only state to have a diamond mine. This is where the first part of our name came from.

Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness.

The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the people we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us.
