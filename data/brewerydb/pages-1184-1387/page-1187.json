All Legend beers are unpasteurized and made from only two-row and specialty barley malt, hops, water and yeast.","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:30:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"US6ZJ8REMX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ujtlp3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"321 West 7th Street","locality":"Richmond","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23224","phone":"804-232-3446","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat:\t11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun:\t12:30 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.526596,"longitude":-77.442841,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\t11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat:\t11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun:\t12:30 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"m9BSAU","name":"Pale Ale - First Gold","nameDisplay":"Pale Ale - First Gold","glasswareId":5,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m9BSAU\/upload_GqQvkj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m9BSAU\/upload_GqQvkj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m9BSAU\/upload_GqQvkj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m9BSAU\/upload_GqQvkj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m9BSAU\/upload_GqQvkj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/m9BSAU\/upload_GqQvkj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-11 12:37:04","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:43:00","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Equipped with an old 400L brew system and a belief that there was room in the market for somebody wanting to make a variety of full flavour, unique beers, we embarked on our journey in early 2012. The concept was simple: make a variety of beers that WE wanted to drink and create a tasting opportunity for our customers to come into the brewery to decide what they liked, and buy to go.\r\n\r\nDuring our first year of operation we released over 20 different beers, underwent one expansion, and our MO remains the same as it was in the beginning. In addition to the retail store our beers can also be found in over 30 local bars and restaurants.\r\n\r\nYou can be sure when you pick up a glass or bottle of our beer that you\u2019re drinking a fresh local product. We work that little old brew house like a pack mule to crank out as much beer as possible. Nearly all of our beer is sold to customers within a week of leaving our brite tanks. That\u2019s freshness that\u2019s hard to find elsewhere.","website":"http:\/\/www.beyondthepale.ca","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0lwJsD\/upload_wBbw8Q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0lwJsD\/upload_wBbw8Q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0lwJsD\/upload_wBbw8Q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0lwJsD\/upload_wBbw8Q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0lwJsD\/upload_wBbw8Q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-03 19:10:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"XoN4oE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5 Hamilton Avenue","locality":"North Ottawa","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"K1Y 1B6","website":"http:\/\/www.beyondthepale.ca","latitude":45.401639,"longitude":-75.7307717,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-04 10:40:10","updateDate":"2014-09-04 10:40:10","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-12:00pm-8:00pm,fri-12:00pm-8:00pm,sat-12:00pm-8:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Toronto","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3bgG2Q","name":"Pale Ale Shuffle","nameDisplay":"Pale Ale Shuffle","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3bgG2Q\/upload_dkH1tu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3bgG2Q\/upload_dkH1tu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3bgG2Q\/upload_dkH1tu-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3bgG2Q\/upload_dkH1tu-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3bgG2Q\/upload_dkH1tu-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3bgG2Q\/upload_dkH1tu-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-15 03:38:51","updateDate":"2016-06-20 18:20:42","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewage.at","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:45:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mMnrjZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mittelgasse 4","locality":"1060 Wien","phone":"+43 1 9550935","website":"http:\/\/brewage.at\/","latitude":48.1939642,"longitude":16.3434939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","updateDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-7:00pm,wed-2:00pm-7:00pm,thu-2:00pm-7:00pm,fri-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"Europe\/Vienna","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JnWsDe","name":"Pale Ale, Chinook Columbus","nameDisplay":"Pale Ale, Chinook Columbus","abv":"5","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-23 18:35:05","updateDate":"2015-12-17 19:54:28","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.\r\n\r\n In June of 2013, Matt purchased Charlie's shares of Double Mountain, vowing to continue the good work the two partners created.","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001nxNUBQroFr3hjq6FYVwFkkyCOBhaGExXaxrZhqC8w77l41A-A2WhADmLcObiDpQkWRv_aW3ZWsS2PPug8oPv5xCH8VvV78Ga","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:17:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9XZOTHG3QJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"4kMvnC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8 Fourth Street","locality":"Hood River","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97031","phone":"541-387-0042","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.7099797,"longitude":-121.5144842,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OAnNVF","name":"Double Mountain Taproom","streetAddress":"4336 Woodstock Blvd","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97206","phone":"(503) 206-5495","website":"www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.4789106,"longitude":-122.6177216,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:05","updateDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gjKO8k","name":"Pale Dog","nameDisplay":"Pale Dog","description":"Pale Ale is an homage to our chairman.

garden shed, making a good pale ale was one of our first objectives. It took us many attempts to come up with a recipe that we were happy with. Now it\u2019s our best selling beer and accounts for half our total production. It\u2019s our house pale ale and a beer that we are proud to brew and delighted to drink.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also proud and delighted that Pale Fire is a favourite in our nearest pub; The Chesham Arms. This pub was saved from the brink by a group of local residents who fought to get it listed as one of the UK\u2019s first Assets of Community Value in October 2012. The campaign went on doggedly for 929 days with the Chesham finally reopening it\u2019s doors as a pub again in Summer 2015. Read more here http:\/\/www.savethechesham.org\/\r\n\r\nPale Fire stole it\u2019s name from a novel in the form of a poem, whose title was lifted from a Shakespeare play\u2026. The cultural plundering doesn\u2019t stop with the name of the beer. The label too is an homage to the great Californian poolscapes painted by David Hockney.
