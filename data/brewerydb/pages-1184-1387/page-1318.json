This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"B2OFnl","name":"Paducah Beer Werks","nameShortDisplay":"Paducah Beer Werks","description":"Located in the Old Greyhound bus stations.

We are an artisinal nano-brewery in the city of Carpinteria, CA that focuses on creating small batch beers with an experimental approach. Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.\r\n \r\nIt is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .  We will participate in, and contribute to, local festivals and events that revolve around brewing, environmentalism, and the promotion of local businesses.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewlabcraft.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-06 17:17:38","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:03:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9768QXB2FA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9Hqlzg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4191-8 Carpinteria Ave.","locality":"Carpinteria","region":"California","postalCode":"93013","phone":"949.922.9152","latitude":34.4037704,"longitude":-119.5337568,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","updateDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-9:00pm,sat-4:00pm-9:00pm,sun-2:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tn8c9Z","name":"Red Rose","nameDisplay":"Red Rose","description":"Barrel aged Irish Red Ale","abv":"7.9","ibu":"12","glasswareId":6,"srmId":13,"availableId":2,"styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.05","createDate":"2016-06-30 16:39:16","updateDate":"2016-06-30 18:38:49","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":13,"name":"13","hex":"CB6200"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:49:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZVWX7SOR0P","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HtFqFO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"831 W Bonanza Rd","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89106","phone":"702-362-7335","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","latitude":36.176722,"longitude":-115.15317,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:35:55","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZAk8AE","name":"Red Rye","nameDisplay":"Red Rye","description":"Red in colour and so beautifully fruity by nature, you'd be forgiven for thinking this is one of your five a day.

Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy.

Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"B0ErFs","name":"Missouri Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Missouri","description":"Based in O'Fallon MO","website":"http:\/\/mobeerco.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B0ErFs\/upload_3Ohizb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B0ErFs\/upload_3Ohizb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B0ErFs\/upload_3Ohizb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B0ErFs\/upload_3Ohizb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B0ErFs\/upload_3Ohizb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-21 18:05:29","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:14:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QVGYKH1TPO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"oOzjIE","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"22 West Industrial Dr.","locality":"O'Fallon","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63366","latitude":38.8060696,"longitude":-90.7530068,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-21 18:53:02","updateDate":"2017-06-21 18:53:02","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
