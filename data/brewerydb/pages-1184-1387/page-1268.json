It\u2019s no ordinary exercise in social activism. Its robust flavor comes from being aged on oak, vanilla and bourbon.

We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0kPord","name":"Pro Bono Vanilla Porter","nameDisplay":"Pro Bono Vanilla Porter","abv":"8.5","ibu":"38.3","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-11-21 21:55:47","updateDate":"2017-11-21 21:58:32","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

We operate a 3 barrel brewhouse (industry speak for really small) on site. Brewing small batches means the beer will always be amazingly fresh and allows for the flexibility to mix it up a little with new recipes getting brewed on a regular basis. Because it will be brewed in such small batches, much of the beer will be available only for purchase in the Bike Dog tasting room \u2014 allowing customers to see the beer go from grain to glass and hobnob with the brewers and allowing the brewers to personally nurture the local craft beer community.","website":"http:\/\/www.bikedogbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-31 20:04:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:18:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F1RD7VAI58","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"KdoYYr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2534 Industrial Boulevard","extendedAddress":"#110","locality":"West Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95691","phone":"(916) 432-3376","website":"http:\/\/www.bikedogbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 9:30 pm","latitude":38.566263,"longitude":-121.543518,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-01 03:30:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 9:30 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"opQ5hZ","name":"Probably Probable Porter","nameDisplay":"Probably Probable Porter","description":"Our porter pours smooth and black, and is sweet chocolate on the nose.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:13:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"UYOVWAHCBD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RW6Da0","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Laurel","region":"MD","postalCode":"20723","latitude":39.1426709,"longitude":-76.860565,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-03-14 17:43:05","updateDate":"2016-05-01 14:34:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gGpsuH","name":"Procrastinator","nameDisplay":"Procrastinator","description":"This flavorful, smooth-sipper is PACKED with late addition Motueka and Ekuanot hops.","abv":"4.5","ibu":"40","availableId":4,"styleId":164,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gGpsuH\/upload_M2VhHC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gGpsuH\/upload_M2VhHC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gGpsuH\/upload_M2VhHC-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gGpsuH\/upload_M2VhHC-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gGpsuH\/upload_M2VhHC-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gGpsuH\/upload_M2VhHC-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-24 14:50:47","updateDate":"2018-07-24 14:51:22","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":164,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Session India Pale Ale","shortName":"Session IPA","description":"Session India Pale Ales are gold to copper.

The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
