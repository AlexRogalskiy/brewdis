Black to very deep ruby\/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"aaN9Np","name":"Twisted Pine Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Twisted Pine","description":"With 30 taps and a team of imaginative brewers, we are proud to provide a beer experience like no other.\r\nFrom traditional styles to adventurous creations, we can offer something to please any palate.

The brewery, located conveniently on Blue Star Highway in Douglas, Michigan, boasts two tasting rooms and outdoor patio dining. The Pub features 16 taps, hard cider, and wine along with a full food menu including everything from unique entrees to shareable appetizers. Free, live music increases the dining experience every Saturday at 6:00 pm, along with live music on the Patio every Thursday at 6:00 pm from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Along with the Pub, the Saugatuck Brewing Company recently added on a second tap room, which has been dubbed \"The Barrel Room,\" including 15 additional taps and a variety of munchies. The Barrel Room is a laid-back tasting room where customers can enjoy a pint while playing a round of one of the many games featured, like shuffleboard, bumper pool, pinball and more.\r\n\r\nSaugatuck Brewing Company is also proud to be the only location in the state of Michigan to offer a \"Brew On Premise\"  program, where customers can come in and brew their own beer on our 3.5 barrel Brew System located in the Pub. All of the beer offered at the Saugatuck Brewing Company is brewed on site on a 45 barrel Brew System in the 14,000 square foot Production Facility. Customers can tour the facility every Saturday at 2:00 pm for $7.50\/person. Each tour includes a complimentary tasting and their choice of a logo'd pint glass or growler to take home.\r\n\r\nThe Saugatuck Brewing Company bottles 7 styles year round, including everything from a crisp Blonde Ale to exciting flavored stouts. SBC also offers a variety of interesting styles throughout the year as bottled seasonals, specialty releases and draft only beers. These beers can be found near and far, as they are distributed through 11 states (Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Jersey and Nebraska) along with 7 foreign markets  (United Kingdom, Western Canada, Germany, Trinidad & Tobago, Ukraine, China and South Korea). While the plan remains to grow these brands throughout the country and world, SBC will never forget that Michigan is where they are from, and where the heart is.\r\n\r\nSaugatuck Brewing Company is located on the southwest coast of Michigan on Blue Star Highway, \u00bd mile North of Exit 36 on Interstate 196.

Eric and Eddie began their relationship working in the same company in Atlanta, GA. Both shared the passion of home brewing and soon realized that home brewing together on the weekends became something they always looked forward to. Following long discussions about attempting our dreams we decided to share our passion and start Pontoon Brewing Company. The \u201cPontoon Lifestyle\u201d came to be as the idea of escaping the daily stresses and relaxing on a pontoon boat. For those unaware, a Pontoon boat is commonly known as a slow moving party platform; it can\u2019t go far and can\u2019t go fast so might as well drink.\r\n \r\nThe Pontoon Brew Crew is currently brewing our beers with our friends and the very talented folks at Thomas Creek Brewery in Greenville, South Carolina with hopes of opening our own brewery in Atlanta, GA in the near future. In the collaborative spirit of home brewing and wanting to develop beer for beer drinkers, we would love to hear your thoughts.","website":"http:\/\/pontoonbrewing.com","mailingListUrl":"info@pontoonbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 14:53:07","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:12:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SIL7T6ZP0K","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"S1LjD3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"500, 8601 Dunwoody Pl Suite 500","extendedAddress":"Suite 500","locality":"Sandy Springs","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30350","phone":"(770) 674-1075","website":"http:\/\/www.pontoonbrewing.com","latitude":33.9917909,"longitude":-84.3446985,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 15:03:40","updateDate":"2019-05-29 20:07:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:30pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:30pm-6:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Drfgts","name":"Pecan Pie Porter","nameDisplay":"Pecan Pie Porter (2014)","description":"Ghengis Pecan relied on mighty powers to repel and uprising of violent turkeys looting bourbon barrels filled with our Pecan Pie Porter.

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"uRHoZ3","name":"Imperial Oak Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Imperial Oak","description":"Imperial Oak Brewing is a Micro brewery focused on brewing high gravity beers with many barrel and wood aged offerings.
