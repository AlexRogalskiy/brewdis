Some time much further down the track they talked about starting a business together. This discussion almost certainly occurred over a beer. Doing what? The answer was right in front of them.\r\n\r\nAndy (Andrew Larsen) had already spent fourteen years in the beer industry. As a brewer and brewing consultant, his business Breowan Systems is a leading player in everything to do with brewing, and Andy works with fellow brewers all around the globe. But what Andy wanted more than anything else, more than a drive in a rally car, more than a Stratocaster, was a brewery in his hometown. Somewhere he could cruise down to on a Sunday with his daughter Katherine, lay a brew down, and listen to some Bailterspace, turned up loud.\r\n\r\nAnt (Anthony Browne) was a suit and tie wearer until 2010. As a beer drinker and lover of all good things in life, he was inevitably drawn to craft beer. After a year and a half of bumming around, some travel and a bit of study, in May 2012 Andy convinced Ant to join him for a week in Melbourne. Good Beer Week to be precise. Not much convincing was necessary. Andy showed Ant what his work in the Aussie beer industry made clear.\r\n\r\nThat restaurant menus need not be a let-down when you get to the beer list. That pubs can serve beers from little breweries, not just the big guys. And that there is a growing number of people that want more than golden lagers and brown ales. Trips to Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington followed, after which Ant was forced to admit that his beloved home-town of Auckland was missing out.\r\n\r\nSo what to do then? A brewery, certainly. But we also wanted to stock beers from all over the world, to keep discovering. And we wanted to offer the flexibility to have a beer at our place, or take some home. Preferably both :-)\r\n\r\nAfter three months planning, constructing and creating, on the 5th of December we opened the Retail Store and Beer Tasting Lounge.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 we outgrew our little brewery and opened up Juke Joint, our new mothership in Mt Eden. Home to our BBQ smokehouse and new, expanded brewery. We started bottling our beer and got it out to the best restaurants, cafes, bars and bottle shops all over Auckland.\r\n\r\nSince then we've broadened our horizons to our Barrel Room out in Orakei where we're serving up gourmet burgers and our signature range of world class beers to the good people of the Eastern Bays. Who knows what's next?","website":"http:\/\/brothersbeer.co.nz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2bF5qA\/upload_GVNWzI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-17

By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

Ours is a \"brewers' brewery\", with an uncompromising focus on beer quality.\r\n\r\n From the beginning, our goal was to make beers that we liked to drink. All of our beers are served up unfiltered and long-aged, to deliver maximum flavor and character. The beers can be very complex and assertive, but with the ultimate goal of proper balance. We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.\r\n\r\n In June of 2013, Matt purchased Charlie's shares of Double Mountain, vowing to continue the good work the two partners created.","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001nxNUBQroFr3hjq6FYVwFkkyCOBhaGExXaxrZhqC8w77l41A-A2WhADmLcObiDpQkWRv_aW3ZWsS2PPug8oPv5xCH8VvV78Ga","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WxtiJC\/upload_AT3wnf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:17:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9XZOTHG3QJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"4kMvnC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8 Fourth Street","locality":"Hood River","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97031","phone":"541-387-0042","website":"http:\/\/www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.7099797,"longitude":-121.5144842,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OAnNVF","name":"Double Mountain Taproom","streetAddress":"4336 Woodstock Blvd","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97206","phone":"(503) 206-5495","website":"www.doublemountainbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.4789106,"longitude":-122.6177216,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:05","updateDate":"2018-03-14 19:17:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":130,"name":"Sterling","description":"Sterling is a relatively new diploid aroma variety, developed from, among other parents, Saaz, Cascade, Brewer's Gold, and Early Green.
