The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Brewmaster Ian VanGundy, winner of over a dozen international and national medals, is overseeing all brewing operations. He was named 30 under 30 in 2013 by All About Beer as a brewer set to make waves in the brewing world.

We currently have a variety of single and double hop IPAs, Lagers and Stouts in the market.  Over the next several months Ian will continue to expand on the variety of styles in the portfolio based on your feedback.  The concept of these small batches is to collect feedback to help us determine recipes destined for larger production next year.

Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.

Opened in October, 2017, Bike TrAle feels like a comfortable living room, with all the construction on the 100 year old building done by Bruce and Greg, with little touches of cycling throughout and cozy chairs and faux cycling stools. The tap surround is hand created using three types of wood. The bar is a large slab of walnut with a live edge and finished with splashes of Greg\u2019s signature purple. A new patio was opened in the spring of 2018, adding seating for over 40. Hops are still grown on Bruce\u2019s farm a few miles from the taproom, and most of the beer is also brewed at the farm.
