This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"PBXvz0","name":"DESTIHL Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"DESTIHL","description":"DESTIHL was founded on the promise of supporting flavor and boycotting bland.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"PBXvz0","name":"DESTIHL Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"DESTIHL","description":"DESTIHL was founded on the promise of supporting flavor and boycotting bland.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"udDKeL","name":"Happy Valley Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Happy Valley","description":"A brewery and restaurant located in a restored wood-beamed structure in State College, Pennsylvania, the home of Penn State University.","website":"http:\/\/www.happyvalleybeer.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/udDKeL\/upload_C5hoLe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/udDKeL\/upload_C5hoLe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/udDKeL\/upload_C5hoLe-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/udDKeL\/upload_C5hoLe-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/udDKeL\/upload_C5hoLe-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-20 01:25:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:27:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HI048YJT3S","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NiB3An","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"137 Elmwood St","locality":"State College","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"16801","phone":"(814) 234-4406","website":"http:\/\/happyvalleybeer.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 2:00 am","latitude":40.8103828,"longitude":-77.8295953,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-20 11:55:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 2:00 am","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mMiiz7","name":"Sais-on, Sais-off","nameDisplay":"Sais-on, Sais-off","abv":"5.9","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-02 17:54:35","updateDate":"2017-08-02 17:54:35","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

It is a golden hued beer, brewed with a 2-Row blend, malted rye, oats and dark Belgian candi sugar. Saison is hopped with Tettnang, Bravo, and Cascade hops. Fermented with a traditional saison yeast strain, Saison exhibits notes of spice and tropical fruit in the aroma. Citrus and a peppery spice dominate the flavor and make way for a pleasant malt character. Saison is full bodied with a remarkably dry finish.","abv":"6.1","availableId":1,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/44agxl\/upload_B2jKyl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/44agxl\/upload_B2jKyl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/44agxl\/upload_B2jKyl-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/44agxl\/upload_B2jKyl-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/44agxl\/upload_B2jKyl-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/44agxl\/upload_B2jKyl-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 12:45:46","updateDate":"2016-10-31 13:44:04","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
