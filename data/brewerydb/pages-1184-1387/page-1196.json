Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.

We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.

We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"d5f81e","name":"Parrot in a Palm Tree Holiday Baltic Porter","nameDisplay":"Parrot in a Palm Tree Holiday Baltic Porter (2010)","description":"In San Diego, we\u2019re not known for our partridges or pears but we can all relate to those noisy parrots and their relentless \u201ccaroling\u201d.

Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts.

After meeting in 2008, their shared passion for craft beer was discovered, and then Aaron and Bobby started brewing together. Recipes were perfected and bigger systems were purchased over the years. Popularity grew and word got around about their beer. The requests for their beer started to reach beyond just family and friends and soon requests from brides and grooms, fund raising events, and private events began to pour in. The \u201cproblem\u201d of having too much beer on hand from wanting to brew so often soon turned into managing brew schedules and starting a waiting list for their beer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2012 Aaron and Bobby, along with their good friend Levi Schaljo, collaborated with Mother Earth Brew Co. to brew a special batch of beer for seven fallen Marines. The beer was named Homage. Thanks to Mother Earth Brew Co. the boys were able to brew 310 gallons of Homage. With help from many volunteers, over 450 \u2013 22oz. bottles were bottled, labeled by hand, and distributed to the squadron and families of the fallen. The remainder of the beer was sold at a private event at Mother Earth Brew Co. and the proceeds went to purchasing shadow boxes for the families to display their loved one\u2019s medals. The proceeds also went to the squadron to help pay for funeral costs. It was then that inspiration to brew for others took over and the trio began to develop a plan to take their operation to the next level and brew professionally.\r\n\r\nAaron, Anne and Bobby began planning to build a brewery and a business. Anne began working at Mother Earth Brew Co. to gain experience in the operations of a taproom and the operational side of a brewery.  Aaron and Bobby continued to brew their array of recipes, catering to the Oceanside area.\r\n\r\nWhen Bobby and Aaron came up with the idea to be professional brewers, they knew they wanted to give back through their beer, but they also wanted their beer and their brewery to represent them. It was quickly decided that the brewery had to be focused around the outdoors. Aaron and Anne grew up in the Northwest and Bobby grew up in upstate New York, and all are avid outdoorsmen. They wanted to bring what they love most about their upbringings to Southern California and that is what inspired the name and the concept of Northern Pine Brewing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are so many elements from home that people would love and appreciate here in Oceanside, and we are excited to bring those to people through Northern Pine Brewing\u201d \u2013 Aaron Ortega.","website":"http:\/\/northernpinebrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:34:56","updateDate":"2019-08-08 13:46:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7E45S18DLH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"U5vEqe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"326 North Horne Street","locality":"Oceanside","region":"California","postalCode":"92054","phone":"(760) 754-1434","website":"http:\/\/northernpinebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","latitude":33.1998358,"longitude":-117.3769334,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:34:58","updateDate":"2018-08-17 18:34:58","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BqROqd","name":"Parsons Glebe","nameDisplay":"Parsons Glebe","description":"A delicate low-hop beer with a biscuity malt character and a clean finish.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XmpI72","name":"Part & Parcel","nameDisplay":"Part & Parcel","description":"Jester King Part & Parcel \u2014 the first beer in modern history brewed with 100% Texas grown and malted grain. \r\n\r\nMade from just well water, Texas barley, hops, yeast, and bacteria, is a great example of our philosophy on farmhouse ales.

More modern versions of this beer incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to a perception of smoothness. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in barely perceptible amounts, but this is not common. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet flavors and aromas can be intense, not cloying, while complementing fruitiness. Though well attenuated it usually has a full, creamy body. Hop characters do not dominate; low to low-medium bitterness is perceived. Perception of alcohol can be extreme. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma should not be evident. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived. Well balanced with savoring\/sipping drinkability. Oxidative character if evident in aged Quads should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"9","abvMax":"14","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.084","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:33:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"4MVtcc","name":"The Bruery","nameShortDisplay":"The Bruery","description":"A boutique craft brewery located in Orange County, California specializing in experimental and barrel aged beer.

All of our beers' recipes were designed and perfected by us, and even our 5-barrel brewing system was custom built by the Jackrabbit crew.  If you come across our beer on tap, or in bottles at your local retailer, rest assured that we poured our passion for beer into every ounce.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackrabbitbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 16:14:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:49:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7YAUXLODRQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"tdu8Qi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1323 Terminal St.","locality":"West Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95691","latitude":38.5718525,"longitude":-121.5413488,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","updateDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-5:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
