We will strive to be a gathering place for beer lovers and support bicycling as a great way to get around our beautiful city.\r\n\r\nPeddler Brewing Company has a 7-barrel brewing system which means it can pump out up to 14 kegs of beer per batch. We plan to have 8 taps in our tap room with a few regular taps and a couple rotating seasonal taps. We also plan to have a guest tap or two of other WA state brews or ciders. Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles\/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat. The bicycle theme will be seen throughout the brewery from the faucet handles in the bathroom to the gears in our concrete counter top.","website":"http:\/\/www.peddlerbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:44:29","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:14:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RZT3H4UFKG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"l6nrGm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1514 NW Leary Way","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"(360) 362-0002","website":"http:\/\/www.peddlerbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":47.663908,"longitude":-122.377033,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:45:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FtdIvU","name":"Pedigree","nameDisplay":"Pedigree","abv":"4.5","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-28 00:48:14","updateDate":"2015-03-31 19:27:45","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"X38nDm","name":"Three Notch'd Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Three Notch'd","description":"Three Notch'd Craft Kitchen & Brewery serves up locally sourced, beer-infused, gourmet food options as well as Three Notch'd craft beer, cider, wine, craft sodas brewed in house, and signature cocktails in a family friendly inviting atmosphere.","website":"http:\/\/threenotchdbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 11:10:10","updateDate":"2019-01-23 13:37:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LPWA4KBJSO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9zVaSj","name":"Three Notch'd Sour House","streetAddress":"946 Grady Ave","extendedAddress":"Ste 9","locality":"Charlottesville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22903","phone":"(434) 961-0959","website":"http:\/\/threenotchdbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  4:00pm -

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.
