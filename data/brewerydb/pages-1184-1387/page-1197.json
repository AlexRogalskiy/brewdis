There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y8stOS","name":"Hermit Thrush Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Hermit Thrush","website":"http:\/\/www.hermitthrushbrewery.com\/","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"INFO@HERMITTHRUSHBREWERY.COM","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y8stOS\/upload_G9u0z9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-23 18:43:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:48:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"74PASEMJBQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S31L0E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29 High St.","extendedAddress":"Suite 101C","locality":"Brattleboro","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05301","latitude":42.8534875,"longitude":-72.5596126,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-24 18:17:17","updateDate":"2015-08-24 18:17:17","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WyFmwE","name":"Party Keg","nameDisplay":"Party Keg","description":"Fruity Pils","abv":"4.7","styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-01-28 16:43:52","updateDate":"2019-01-28 16:43:52","style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

Make great beer.\r\n\r\nBuckleDown Brewing was founded by friends, Ike Orcutt (Head Brewer) and Sean Mahoney in Lyons, IL. We share a philosophy that two qualities that make great brewers (or great anything for that matter) are creativity and determination. Plus, there's something uniquely gratifying about working hard, working with your hands, and making something you are proud of.\r\n\r\nWe're putting that philosophy into practice by brewing small-batch craft beer. From hopped up American IPAs to Belgian-Style Ales, we're brewing the kind of beer that we love to drink, and we're looking forward to sharing it with everbody who's willing to join us.","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7B7roC\/upload_rizsjw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-13 17:12:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:27:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CR4JG12LNA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"VAj3CW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8700 W. 47th St.","locality":"Lyons","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60534","website":"http:\/\/www.buckledownbrewing.com\/brewery\/","latitude":41.8060004,"longitude":-87.8370967,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 18:28:06","updateDate":"2015-01-14 20:24:00","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-12:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HONgvz","name":"Party Pooper","nameDisplay":"Party Pooper","description":"Pineapple Upside Down Cake Strong Ale\r\n\r\nBrewed for our good friends at Goodfriend Beer Garden's 2 Year Anniversary.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gSzeWc","name":"Passchendaele","nameDisplay":"Passchendaele","description":"BEER BREWED IN MEMORY OF THE BATTLE OF PASSCHENDAELE 1917\r\nThe Passchendaele has a surprisingly rich taste, one that you would expect from a stronger beer.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.
