These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ee9ead","name":"Singlecut Beersmiths","nameShortDisplay":"Singlecut Beersmiths","description":"SingleCut Beersmiths was founded by Queens\/NYC born, music-obsessed brewer Rich Buceta, whose life-long passions led to a place where hops and vinyl could shine side by side.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities.

With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

Self-financed and eager to begin, they purchased and assembled a one-barrel brewing system and got to work. Austin Street opened its doors on Industrial Way in Portland, Maine in early 2014. Since then, Will and Jake have maintained 100% ownership of their startup. Although this arrangement has its limitations, Jake and Will insist this is the only way for them to stay true to their creative roots while providing the best products possible to consumers and guests of their tasting rooms. Now utilizing 160 barrels of fermentation space between two production facilities, the pair is poised to maintain their position of integrity and quality in the very community that supports them.","website":"http:\/\/www.austinstreetbrewery.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Juxv3L\/upload_q3YZlN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-09 14:03:14","updateDate":"2019-04-06 20:15:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q4JBD586WH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LrQuwi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Industrial Way","extendedAddress":"Suite 8","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04103","phone":"(207) 200-1994","website":"http:\/\/www.austinstreetbrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday 12pm-5pm\r\nMonday 12pm-7pm\r\nTuesday - CLOSED\r\nWednesday - Saturday - 12pm - 7pm","latitude":43.7028644,"longitude":-70.3200298,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-13 19:20:47","updateDate":"2019-04-06 20:23:10","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday 12pm-5pm\r\nMonday 12pm-7pm\r\nTuesday - CLOSED\r\nWednesday - Saturday - 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ua6Mb2","name":"Austin Street Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Fox Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04101","phone":"(207) 200-1994","website":"http:\/\/www.austinstreetbrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Wednesday - 12pm - 7pm\r\nThursday - Saturday - 12pm- 9pm","latitude":43.6652233,"longitude":-70.2576771,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-03-26 18:28:47","updateDate":"2019-04-06 20:21:28","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Wednesday - 12pm - 7pm\r\nThursday - Saturday - 12pm- 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jf5IZ8","name":"Patio Beer","nameDisplay":"Patio Beer","description":"This beer was brewed to commemorate the Grand Opening of the Hangar 24 Patio\/Beer Garden on January 15th 2011.

This recipe was inspired by a particular favourite dish on HOME\u2019s menu; Pigeon breast with game ragout, fennel and truffled pomme souffl\u00e9. The idea was for the sweetness of the malt to rest nicely alongside the balance of flavours in the dish, with the subtle liquorice notes harmonising with the fennel ketchup. We created this beer with the view that not only could it be enjoyed alone, but as a beer pairing with their menu to offer insight to how incredible a pairing between food and beer can be.\r\n\r\nTo compliment the flavours of the dish (the rich, irony, gamey flavours alongside a sour medicinal rooty flavour from the fennel) we realised that a beer inspired by Pontefract cake would be a perfect pairing. Not only that, it was also a personal favourite of chef Elizabeth\u2019s mum; a flavour that she really associated with her childhood, exemplifying HOME\u2019s MO of reimagining familiar and nostalgic flavours; plus it only seemed right that a collaboration between two progressive names in Northern food and drink that share so many of the same values should pay homage to Yorkshire food & drink heritage!\r\n\r\nWe felt this flavour profile would complement a darker style of beer which led us down the path of an India porter!","abv":"6","ibu":"20","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-08 14:39:34","updateDate":"2018-10-08 14:41:08","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
