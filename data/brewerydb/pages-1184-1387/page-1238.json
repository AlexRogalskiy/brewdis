Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber.

Ask for it at your local watering hole! \r\n\r\nAt Raleigh Brewing Company we intend to be a big part of the local Raleigh community. We plan to do that by staying as green as possible by reclaiming our water used to brew with, recycling, and conserving energy, donating money\/beer\/time to local charities, and opening up our space for local groups\/organizations\/events as much as possible. If there's anything you'd like to see us do, just shoot us an email! \r\n\r\nWe look forward to opening our doors and serving you some hand-crafted beers, which will hopefully be at the very beginning of 2013! \r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.raleighbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ST1lih\/upload_6uLPik-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ST1lih\/upload_6uLPik-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ST1lih\/upload_6uLPik-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ST1lih\/upload_6uLPik-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ST1lih\/upload_6uLPik-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-06 21:01:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:07:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0E8PS6OHFU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wroV30","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3709 Neil Street","locality":"Raleigh","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27607","phone":"919-696-4901","website":"http:\/\/www.raleighbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Tuesday Noon -10\r\nWednesday - Thursday Noon - 11\r\nFriday Saturday: Noon - 12\r\nSunday: Noon - 6","latitude":35.7928582,"longitude":-78.6869788,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-06 21:03:28","updateDate":"2015-10-28 17:43:32","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Tuesday Noon -10\r\nWednesday - Thursday Noon - 11\r\nFriday Saturday: Noon - 12\r\nSunday: Noon - 6","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xNfcWk","name":"Pinky Cherry Wit","nameDisplay":"Pinky Cherry Wit","abv":"4.7","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-04 20:57:09","updateDate":"2018-07-04 21:08:48","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

I don't know that we recognized at the time that it was a life altering event; but, mostly out of desire to have more mead in our lives that measured up to the quality we had experienced from them we decided to start making our own.  Having no local meadmakers to draw from, this gave us the luxury of being unafraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients not associated with meads.  Some experiments failed and others worked great, all had a powerful influence on how we saw mead and what we thought mead could be.\r\nLike any hobby we dove face first into meadmaking.  Our goal was simple, to create memorable experiences through mead using locally produced ingredients to the extent possible.  Soon we were sharing those meads with friends and they shared them with others. I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative.

The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.
