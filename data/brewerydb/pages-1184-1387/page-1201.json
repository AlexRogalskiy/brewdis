In a bid to test the boundaries of this style, this particular one is exploring the depth of flavour that can be achieved in the beer through the use of a multigrain base layer. The flavour is led by the earthy spice from the malted rye, whilst being backed up with the silky, nutty contribution of the oats.\r\n\r\nThe dark colour essential to black IPAs has come from Carafa Spezial III and Sinamar. Taking what we learned from our last patrons project with Ricky Lightfoot and Moor, Watching Crag, we wanted to minimize the dark roast flavour and make a black IPA which is as soft and juicy as possible.\r\n\r\nThe first hops went in at the whirlpool stage. We chose a favourite of ours in the form of Mosaic alongside Zythos, an unsung US hop which brings ripe pineapple and zingy grapefruit flavours. For the dry hop we used a double addition of the same two varieties but backed up by Amarillo for classic juicy mandarin notes.","abv":"6.66","ibu":"30","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rDz3nS\/upload_BEaLM3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rDz3nS\/upload_BEaLM3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rDz3nS\/upload_BEaLM3-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rDz3nS\/upload_BEaLM3-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rDz3nS\/upload_BEaLM3-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/rDz3nS\/upload_BEaLM3-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-13 20:03:47","updateDate":"2018-12-13 20:04:11","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

We decided to try out a new IPA style that we\u2019d been hearing about \u2013 Brut IPA. Enzymes break down all of the complex wort sugars into easily fermentable glucose, resulting in a bone-dry IPA backed up by high, sparkling carbonation. Another avenue we\u2019d been keen to go down for a while was brewing with grapes alongside one of our favourite but hard to source hops, Nelson Sauvin. This felt like the perfect opportunity. We fermented this IPA with a Kolsch yeast strain \u2013 super clean and highly attenuative; then added 20L of white grape juice per barrel and double dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin. The hop line up was then backed up with Halllertau Blanc, Citra BBC and Ekuanot Cryo pellets for a soft but crisp, resinous IPA full of juicy grape, elderflower, apricot and lime zest flavours.","abv":"7","ibu":"15","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yvnnUp\/upload_WMLpSQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yvnnUp\/upload_WMLpSQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yvnnUp\/upload_WMLpSQ-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yvnnUp\/upload_WMLpSQ-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yvnnUp\/upload_WMLpSQ-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yvnnUp\/upload_WMLpSQ-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-02 15:52:03","updateDate":"2018-10-02 15:54:27","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

A few people in particular that we got talking with inspired some new and exciting collaboration ideas, and this is one of them.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we have been lucky enough to welcome not just one, but two of these breweries to Leeds to brew with. First up we have Civil Society, a Florida based brewery who have perfected the art of bringing a little bit of Florida sunshine to all their beers! We have also managed to snag our second collaboration with Slim Pickens, the maker of cider and mead that tastes like the best juice you ever drank.\r\n\r\nWe decided to brew a double dry hopped New England style IPA with them and we invited our guests to pick their favourite hops of the moment to headline the beer. Karl from Civil Society and Todd from Slim Pickens came up with the classy trio of Citra, Hallertau Blanc and Lemon Drop giving this IPA a sublime balance of citrus zest, grape juice and ripe tropical fruit over a super smooth oat-heavy base.","abv":"7","ibu":"25","styleId":172,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-27 14:31:26","updateDate":"2018-09-27 14:32:24","style":{"id":172,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Juicy or Hazy India Pale Ale","shortName":"Juicy or Hazy IPA","description":"Color: Straw to deep gold\r\n\r\nClarity: Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

We belong to the 6 breweries, which have the exclusive permission to supply their beer at the largest folk festival in the world where we serve over a million litres in our beer tents \u2013 brought to your table by waitresses who easily carry ten 1 litre beer mugs (Mass) at once.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature from other festival beers is the particular harmony of balance between the sweeter taste of malt and that of the hops. The initial mild taste followed by a stronger note, invites you to take a second taste.\r\n\r\nBy tradition it is also slightly stronger than a normal Lager, but the high grade of fermentation makes it particularly easy to drink.
