Three different dark roasted malts provide intense roasty flavors of dark chocolate, espresso and licorice. A heavy dose of hops gives enough bitterness to balance the malts. Rich, thick and mouth-coating, this beer is perfect for sipping and contemplating.\r\n\r\nRussian Imperial Stout gets its name from British brewing tradition. Historically, very strong, dark beers were brewed in England to be shipped to the Baltic region. The Russian Monarchy loved these beers so much that the beers began being referred to as Russian Stouts. Our Russian Imperial Stout is brewed with a unique method that compounds each subsequent batch with wort from the previous. The result is a truly rich, complex beer. This is the base that we age in Bourbon Barrels to eventually become Pugachev\u2019s Cobra.","abv":"12.5","ibu":"85","glasswareId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Flourless Chocolate Cake, Raspberry Tarts, Blue Cheese","createDate":"2013-05-09 17:53:28","updateDate":"2015-04-23 19:03:03","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

More than 150 years later, the Stevens Point Brewery continues to successfully brew quality beer, just as the brewery\u2019s founders, Frank Wahle and George Ruder, did in 1857. This undeniable endurance is a testament of why the Stevens Point Brewery, in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, is the 5th oldest continuously operating brewery remaining in the United States. Today, the Stevens Point Brewery is proud to be Wisconsin-owned and independently operated.","website":"http:\/\/www.pointbeer.com\/","established":"1857","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001QOqrPM3hRDN-5KgIao1mCQ==","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/djGgca\/upload_cL9XxF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:46:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CWHSXVG175","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"54skNQ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2617 Water Street","locality":"Stevens Point","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54481","phone":"715-344-9310","website":"http:\/\/www.pointbeer.com\/","latitude":44.5104,"longitude":-89.5734,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XPlQyf","name":"Russian Imperial Stout","nameDisplay":"Russian Imperial Stout","description":"Big, chewy and delicious imperial Stout that is filled with dark chocolate, caramel, and roasted flavors from a variety of malted barley.

Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity.
