It\u2019s built on Belgian pilsner malt and flaked wheat with east Kent Golding, Motueka and Citra hops plus French Saison yeast. This very effervescent brew has a light banana aroma with medium body that\u2019s well attenuated, dry and fruity, with a pepper and clove aroma and flavor and a very slightly sour finish.

He realized these types of beers were his true passion and decided to create a place where he could focus solely on 100% oak barrel fermentations using saccharomyces, brettanomyces and lactic acid bacteria, all while using local Colorado ingredients.\r\n\r\nCasey Brewing and Blending is the idea of bringing back old-world brewing techniques to the modern day consumer. Our beers are created with over 99% local Colorado ingredients. We ferment and age our beers in vintage oak barrels with a mixed culture of saccharomyces, brettanomyces and lactic acid bacteria. Time is one of the most important elements to us, as the barrel aging process creates flavors that are impossible to create any other way.

Belgium. Boy on bike. (OK, make that a young man of 32). As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.
