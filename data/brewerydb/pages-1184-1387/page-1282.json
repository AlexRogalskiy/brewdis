These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"fToAQf","name":"Adirondack Pub & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Adirondack Pub","description":"All of our craft-brewed beers are made on the premises using only the finest malt, hops, yeast and water.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"qq0CWt","name":"Toolbox Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Toolbox","description":"Located in North County San Diego, Toolbox Brewing Company is an international award winning small batch craft brewery dedicated to making artisanal, sour & brett beers with a focus on barrel aged wild ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.toolboxbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qq0CWt\/upload_F2s7yv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qq0CWt\/upload_F2s7yv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qq0CWt\/upload_F2s7yv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qq0CWt\/upload_F2s7yv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qq0CWt\/upload_F2s7yv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-29 03:38:37","updateDate":"2018-12-14 21:30:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EKLsIA","name":"Brewery & Tasting Room","streetAddress":"1495 Poinsettia Ave","extendedAddress":"#148","locality":"Vista","region":"California","postalCode":"92081","phone":"(760) 598-1477","website":"http:\/\/www.toolboxbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  CLOSED\r\nTue:  CLOSED\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm","latitude":33.1366973,"longitude":-117.2268704,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-29 03:38:37","updateDate":"2018-12-14 21:29:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-8:00pm,thu-3:00pm-8:00pm,fri-3:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  CLOSED\r\nTue:  CLOSED\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NhDTfN","name":"Purple Gang","nameDisplay":"Purple Gang","abv":"5.2","glasswareId":4,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NhDTfN\/upload_H3b7v0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NhDTfN\/upload_H3b7v0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NhDTfN\/upload_H3b7v0-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NhDTfN\/upload_H3b7v0-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NhDTfN\/upload_H3b7v0-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/NhDTfN\/upload_H3b7v0-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:01","updateDate":"2015-12-16 14:38:59","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
