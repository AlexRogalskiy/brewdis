If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

While tempting to session this beer, the name is a necessary reminder that despite the surprising approachability, this beer weighs in at a hefty 7.8% ABV.","abv":"7.8","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":138,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qq0CWt\/upload_lYqa5X-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qq0CWt\/upload_lYqa5X-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qq0CWt\/upload_lYqa5X-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qq0CWt\/upload_lYqa5X-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qq0CWt\/upload_lYqa5X-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qq0CWt\/upload_lYqa5X-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:01","updateDate":"2019-06-19 17:54:50","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":138,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Strong Ale or Lager","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Any style of beer can be made stronger than the classic style guidelines.

It\u2019s the story of a semi-lost 20 something year old with a young family, who fell in love with the art and science of brewing beer, instead of finishing college, like he was supposed to. He may well still be brewing in his garage at this very moment, if his retired father, Gary had not believed in his son, and offered to join him in business.\r\nGreg, with one small child and another on the way, somehow convinced his wife, Natalia that moving across two states and buying into a failing brewery was a good idea. If nothing else, Greg is persuasive. Three months into the social experiment, Gary, Greg\u2019s dad had the inspired idea to bring in Greg\u2019s good high school friend, Ross as a partner. Granted Ross was an English major (which has nothing to do with beer?), but hey, the guy can talk to anybody.\r\nAnd well, they did what anybody would do in their shoes. Worked all hours of the day for wages below poverty level. Talked to the people, found out what they wanted and made it. Poured beer at festivals all over the state. Shook hands. Begged for placements at bars. Picked up spare change off the sidewalk. Made big mistakes. Figured out how to correct them. Learned a few things the easy way. Learned a lot of things the hard way. And were grateful that at least they had access to nearly free beer.\r\nIn the process of struggling to make something out of very little, they figured out what Iron Horse Brewery really stood for. They weren\u2019t making beer to please the critics of the world, they were making craft beer for people. There are a lot of rules and regulations about how things should be, and when it comes to their beer and their lives, they don\u2019t care about rules. They care about innovation, taking risks, and authenticity.\r\nWith that core belief intact you have the Iron Horse Brewery of today; Greg continuing to push the envelope, Ross using a vernacular more appropriate to classical literature than selling beer, Gary suggesting barrier-busting, painfully optimistic future plans, Natalia still working in the business for the sole purpose of keeping Greg in check, and an amazing staff that keeps Iron Horse Beers moving into the hands of the people.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"mHYmoz","name":"Freigeist Bierkultur","nameShortDisplay":"Freigeist Bierkultur","website":"http:\/\/www.bierkompass.de\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mHYmoz\/upload_TEKhbX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mHYmoz\/upload_TEKhbX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mHYmoz\/upload_TEKhbX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mHYmoz\/upload_TEKhbX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mHYmoz\/upload_TEKhbX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-29 13:18:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9luSaG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Diepenlinchener Str. 20","locality":"Stolberg","region":"North Rhine-Westphalia","postalCode":"52224","phone":"(49) 2402\/75380","website":"http:\/\/www.bierkompass.de\/","latitude":50.7615326,"longitude":6.2722549,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-29 13:18:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"igiOAJ","name":"Quince Love","nameDisplay":"Quince Love","description":"Wheat Love (our wheat wine) aged in Traverse City Whiskey barrels, with quince.","abv":"13.7","styleId":35,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/igiOAJ\/upload_uf1leY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/igiOAJ\/upload_uf1leY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/igiOAJ\/upload_uf1leY-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/igiOAJ\/upload_uf1leY-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/igiOAJ\/upload_uf1leY-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/igiOAJ\/upload_uf1leY-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-23 04:10:12","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:53:02","style":{"id":35,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Wheat Wine Ale","shortName":"Wheatwine","description":"American style wheat wines range from gold to deep amber and are brewed with 50% or more wheat malt.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ll00zf","name":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jackie O's","description":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery prides itself in creating neo-traditional handcrafted artisan ales.
