That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co!

The two men, whose passion for beer runs as deep as Superior, are the driving force behind Keweenaw Brewing Company.","website":"http:\/\/kbc.beer\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2mEK6e\/upload_Ezh5TD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:05:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VFEYSX2AI8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"LZ4UuN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"408 Shelden Avenue","locality":"Houghton","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49931","phone":"906-482-5596","website":"http:\/\/www.keweenawbrewing.com\/","latitude":47.1218751,"longitude":-88.5688653,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VQ7by9","name":"Point\/Counterpoint","nameDisplay":"Point\/Counterpoint","abv":"6.2","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-13 16:55:12","updateDate":"2018-09-13 16:55:12","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"rlG8sP","name":"Finback Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Finback","description":"Our goal is to make great beer following our passion for richness and complexity from quality ingredients and small batch artisanal brewing.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"oHbFpl","name":"Springdale Barrel Room","nameShortDisplay":"Springdale Barrel Room","description":"The Springdale Barrel Room is where we let the ancient alchemy between beer and oak work its slow magic. Our thousands of oak barrels contain ales and lagers that are undergoing fermentation by a horde of yeast and bacteria. Blending these barrels into funky, complex and sometimes sour beer is an historical art form that we celebrate in our space.\r\n\r\nOur experimentation also extends to that most important of beer ingredients, yeast. Many Springdale beers are fermented with classic ale yeast strains, rather than our parent brewery\u2019s lager yeasts. These yeasts express themselves in our beers with spicy, fruity characteristics that are classic in many styles that we have have long loved, such as saison.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the ideal that beer needs to remain fun. Our space is decked out with pinball, skeeball, arcade games and other classics that remind us of birthday parties of our youth.\r\n\r\nWhy ale?!\r\nJack\u2019s Abby Craft Lagers was founded in 2011 by brothers Jack, Eric and Sam Hendler with the goal of brewing world-class, German-style lagers. After several years of expansion, the brothers decided that the challenge of working with ale yeasts and sour cultures was too tempting to pass up. Springdale Barrel Room is built with experimentation in mind as we seek to push ourselves and our beers into uncharted territories.","website":"http:\/\/springdalebeer.com\/","mailingListUrl":"info@springdalebeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oHbFpl\/upload_pS6tyK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-08 20:37:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8OGRRL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"102 Clinton St.","locality":"Framingham","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01702","phone":"(508) 872-0900","latitude":42.2794958,"longitude":-71.4097844,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-08 20:41:05","updateDate":"2017-01-08 20:41:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2sdwN5","name":"Poivre Du Sichuan","nameDisplay":"Poivre Du Sichuan","description":"Continuing our theme of Saisons brewed with peppercorns, Poivre du Sichuan is brewed with Szechuan peppercorns, coriander, pink peppercorns, ginger and ornage peal.
