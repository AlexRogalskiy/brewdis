But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....\r\n \r\nJosh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.\r\nJosh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   \r\nFast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  \r\n\r\nMany weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  \r\n\r\nGoodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, \"I'm coming over to your house.\"  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  \"Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.\" \r\n\r\nJosh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. \r\n\r\nOne week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was\r\na hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!\r\n \r\nNow that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours. No matter what the occasion, visiting The Public House Brewery is always an extraordinary experience.  \r\n \r\nThe team at Public House looks forward to welcoming you!","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-12-18 19:07:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5SH064IZ1R","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"e0v4NA","name":"Rolla Brewpub","streetAddress":"600 North Rolla Street","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Rolla","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65401","phone":"573-426-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","latitude":37.9489305,"longitude":-91.7721244,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:44:16","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Dch3p7","name":"Public House Brewing Company","streetAddress":"551 State Route B","locality":"St. James","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65559","phone":"573-261-3333","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com","latitude":38.009672,"longitude":-91.6072769,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-27 16:11:23","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:05:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-7:00pm,mon-11:00am-7:00pm,tue-11:00am-7:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"W1CPhY","name":"Earthbound Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Earthbound","website":"http:\/\/www.earthboundbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-17 00:51:39","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:19:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MWNAEJZ5CS","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TlPQGQ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2724 Cherokee Street","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63118","phone":"3147699576","website":"Earthboundbeer.com","latitude":38.5934641,"longitude":-90.2286068,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-17 00:51:41","updateDate":"2018-04-10 13:19:42","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tgf8pI","name":"POP Gose","nameDisplay":"POP Gose","description":"This sour spring ale has undergone spontaneous primary fermentation with native microbes found in the air in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America\u2019s taps ran dry.\r\n\r\nThe brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco\u2019s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy\u2019s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery\u2019s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Tap Room opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery\u2019s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery\u2019s original fifteen barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.   \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Speakeasy beer brands and brewing equipment were acquired by Hunters Point Brewery, a company founded by former beverage distributor, Ces Butner. Under new ownership Speakeasy Ales & Lagers will grow by leaps and bounds.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"tFoqj5","name":"Mikkeller","nameShortDisplay":"Mikkeller","description":"The story of Mikkeller is the story of two homebrewers that in a few years went from hobby brewing in the kitchen to national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nSince the summer of 2007, Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8, has run Mikkeller on his own.

Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-12-14 21:09:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JS9DRET054","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"024FnR","name":"Poppels American Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Poppels American Pale Ale","description":"\u00d6len du h\u00e5ller i din hand \u00e4r en American Pale Ale (APA).

American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"xGNZVL","name":"Poppels Bryggeri","nameShortDisplay":"Poppels Bryggeri","website":"http:\/\/www.poppels.se\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xGNZVL\/upload_U2gmox-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xGNZVL\/upload_U2gmox-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xGNZVL\/upload_U2gmox-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xGNZVL\/upload_U2gmox-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/xGNZVL\/upload_U2gmox-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-18 14:04:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MZnlhW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"KANALSTR\u00c5KET 5","locality":"Jonsered","postalCode":"433 76","latitude":57.7496375,"longitude":12.1765596,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-20 14:46:42","updateDate":"2017-08-24 18:20:43","country":{"isoCode":"SE","name":"SWEDEN","displayName":"Sweden","isoThree":"SWE","numberCode":752,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2ASlm6","name":"Poppels Projekt 007 Imperial Saison Svarta Vinb\u00e4r","nameDisplay":"Poppels Projekt 007 Imperial Saison Svarta Vinb\u00e4r","description":"Imperial Saison \/ Super Saison brewed with crowdsourced black currant.\r\nLimited release 5000 liters.\r\nCrowdsourced beer! \r\n\r\nSaison, som betyder s\u00e4song p\u00e5 franska, bryggdes ursprungligen av b\u00f6nder i de fransktalande delarna av Belgien.

In evaluating these beers, judges will weigh several factors such as uniqueness, heritage, regional distinction, technical brewing skills, and balance of character, background story & information and overall spirit of the intent of this category. \"Historical beers\" that are not represented elsewhere as a definitive style in these guidelines could possibly be entered in such categories as Experimental, Herb & Spice, Field Beer, etc. but by choice a brewer may categorize (and enter) their beer as Historical beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:20:40"},"breweries":[{"id":"ago3Ks","name":"Territorial Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Territorial","description":"German-inspired beer and cuisine crafted with our city\u2019s heritage of greatness in mind.","website":"http:\/\/territorialbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ago3Ks\/upload_AYwgx4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ago3Ks\/upload_AYwgx4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ago3Ks\/upload_AYwgx4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ago3Ks\/upload_AYwgx4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ago3Ks\/upload_AYwgx4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-11 23:31:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:06:22","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A1GJYWPX9C","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"AgCpQM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"256 Helmer Road North","locality":"Springfield","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49037","phone":"269-282-1694","latitude":42.3151432,"longitude":-85.2357576,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-11 23:31:48","updateDate":"2017-08-22 14:35:11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"N5lJcK","name":"Territorial Brewing Company Production Facility","streetAddress":"2815 6th Ave.","locality":"Springfield","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49037","phone":"(269) 441-0030","website":"http:\/\/www.territorialbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.3146987,"longitude":-85.2297011,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-19 16:30:07","updateDate":"2018-06-21 13:38:21","timezoneId":"America\/Detroit","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"2fm8Sz","name":"Territorial Brewing Company Production Facility","streetAddress":"2815 6th Ave","locality":"Springfield","region":"MI","postalCode":"49037","phone":"2694410030","website":"territorialbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"not open to public","latitude":42.3146987,"longitude":-85.2297011,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-06-29 13:42:48","updateDate":"2018-07-17 18:05:41","hoursOfOperationNotes":"not open to public","timezoneId":"America\/Detroit","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FEXohC","name":"Poppy Chulo","nameDisplay":"Poppy Chulo","description":"is a straw to medium blonde ale that has moderate bitterness and maltiness","abv":"4","ibu":"22.6","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FEXohC\/upload_lXjZaf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FEXohC\/upload_lXjZaf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FEXohC\/upload_lXjZaf-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-23 02:35:31","updateDate":"2018-06-25 12:58:22","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery. Live music and dancing will also be a regular nighttime happening at the brewpub consisting of mostly local bands playing cover type and original Rock, Blues, Jazz and Reggae.","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","established":"1992","mailingListUrl":"info@eltorobrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:20:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"I0QL94KCRU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"4F7QA9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"17605 Monterey Road","locality":"Morgan Hill","region":"California","postalCode":"95037","phone":"408-782-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","latitude":37.1304557,"longitude":-121.6546846,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pk8OEX","name":"Poppy's Moonship","nameDisplay":"Poppy's Moonship","description":"Poppy\u2019s Moonship, like its German counterparts (especially those from Saxony), is a Gose (pronounced Goes\u2019-ah), brewed with coriander and sea salt.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"XKnAyM","name":"Schilling Beer Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Schilling Beer Co.","description":"Schilling Beer Co.'s lagers and ales are inspired by centuries-old Belgian, Czech and German beer-making, yet are defined by their modern relevance and creativity.
