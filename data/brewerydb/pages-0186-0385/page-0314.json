Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.

Sulfur character and\/or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be extremely low or absent from this style of beer.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"22","abvMin":"4.2","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"5","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"1d90Lc","name":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Ballast Point","description":"Ballast Point Brewing Company is one of San Diego's Premiere Breweries. We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Since that day we are brewing the Calwer-Eck-Br\u00e4u following our own recipe. It is a bottom-fermented, natural cloudy beer, fresh from the cave. Although it is strongly liable to the German Purity Law dated 1516 it is different to most other beers, since we are not filtering or pasteurizing it but bring it directly from the brewery to your table.\r\n\r\nIn order to make your stay a most pleasant one, we serve homemade Swabian delicacies with the freshly brewed beer. You can have a look on our traditional micro brewery directly from your seat in the restaurant and you can join a guided tour upon appointment. There are no separate rooms in our pleasant and friendly pub but we\u00b4ll be pleased to reserve the requested number of seats for you in one of our most comfortable places of the pub to make your stay with your friends or collegues most enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIf you come with a larger group of people you have the opportunity to rent the whole restaurant where we will spoil you with our speciality buffets. It will be a pleasure to help you with the combination of your menue and to create the right atmosphere for your stay. Our catering service will bring our home-made delicacies to ever place you want. We will be pleased to handle the whole organisation of your event. Please do not hesitate to contact us in time so that we have all opportunities to meet your requests.","website":"http:\/\/www.calwereck.de\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igkxXX\/upload_5AJZP2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igkxXX\/upload_5AJZP2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igkxXX\/upload_5AJZP2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igkxXX\/upload_5AJZP2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/igkxXX\/upload_5AJZP2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"A8ZfiN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Calwer Stra\u00dfe 31","region":"Stuttgart","postalCode":"70173","phone":"011 49 711\/22249440","website":"http:\/\/www.calwereck.de\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t11:00 am\t-\t12:00 am\r\nFri:\t11:00 am\t-\t1:00 am\r\nSat:\t10:00 am\t-\t1:00 am\r\nSun:\t10:00 am\t-\t12:00 am","latitude":48.776005,"longitude":9.17993,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-08 17:01:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\t11:00 am\t-\t12:00 am\r\nFri:\t11:00 am\t-\t1:00 am\r\nSat:\t10:00 am\t-\t1:00 am\r\nSun:\t10:00 am\t-\t12:00 am","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gz4uZ6","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","latitude":48.761009,"longitude":8.23147,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:16","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
