From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 22 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"COZL0NR6V3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","timezoneId":"America\/Anchorage","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"93xXWK","name":"Breakwall Blueberry Wheat","nameDisplay":"Breakwall Blueberry Wheat","description":"Slight to moderate wheat brew with a wonderful blueberry aroma and flavor.","abv":"5","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-09 14:17:36","updateDate":"2015-07-09 14:17:36","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

The brewery was Aurora, Colorado\u2019s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.

A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing. This brewery celebrates determination, knowledge, and the humble pride we wave like a battle flag.","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonBrewingCompany\/app_100265896690345?ref=page_internal","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:09:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:36:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"G851P7EZKA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"JZyJiP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 W. 7th","locality":"Covington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41011","phone":"859-261-5600","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","latitude":39.0829077,"longitude":-84.5109181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 17:33:55","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:29:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LgDR9B","name":"Braxton Labs","streetAddress":"95 Riviera Dr.","locality":"Bellevue","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41073","phone":"859-291-0036","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonLabs\/","latitude":39.1001948,"longitude":-84.4877355,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","updateDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tXcLGG","name":"Breendonkulious","nameDisplay":"Breendonkulious","description":"An experimental Golden ale brewed with cherries.","abv":"8.7","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-19 14:10:19","updateDate":"2017-07-19 14:10:19","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

His great grandparents were bootleggers in Detroit, running booze from Canada, who also ran a blind pig speakeasy out of their basement. Detroit police (including the Chief) were their main clientele. His great grandmother also made beer in her kitchen for the guys at the brickyard where she worked.\r\n\r\nNathan's grandfather Cecil -- rail worker, 17-year Ford employee turned weird angry recluse -- left Detroit for Hillsdale, MI to start farming. Cecil started brewing in the early 80's, naming beers after the things that inspired the recipes and included ingredients he grew or foraged. \r\n\r\nAfter some frustration with trying to break into brewing, Nathan started Bitter Old Fecker, working under Cecil as an apprentice. During the start up process, Nathan took a job as an assistant brewer at Grizzly Peak, leaving after 18 months to focus efforts on Bitter Old Fecker exclusively. \r\n\r\nNathan and Cecil produce high gravity, bold beers brewed in a \"rustic\" style. No automatic equipment. Kettles, mash tuns, etc., stirred by hand in a brewery that can literally produce beer without the use of electricity. All beers are barrel-aged and include non traditional, foraged and locally sourced ingredients. All malt and hops are 100% US grown. His first brew, introduced in the Summer of 2013, is called Strutter, named after a nasty old rooster on Cecil's farm. Darlin', Kaplan, and Jet are brews that are soon to follow.","website":"https:\/\/bitteroldfeckerrusticales.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:33:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:00:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"YM4WZUXDTR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SMLKXz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12855 East Highway 12","locality":"Chelsea","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48118","phone":"(734) 444-5201","website":"http:\/\/drinkoldfecker.com","latitude":42.2986578,"longitude":-83.9820734,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:44:43","updateDate":"2019-05-22 20:03:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"p9hekk","name":"Breeze Under The Kilt","nameDisplay":"Breeze Under The Kilt","description":"This savory and sweet malt-forward beer was brewed at Big Storm Brewing Co. with friends from Tampa Bay Brewing Company and Southern Brewing & Winemaking.

Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"eXqBnO","name":"Tampa Bay Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Tampa Bay","description":"As one of Florida's oldest and largest independent craft breweries, TBBC has pioneered the Florida craft beer scene landscape.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EHRB4SUDWI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"hLUaTY","name":"Asgard Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Asgard","description":"Located in Columbia, Tennessee, with a  taproom operating since 9\/01\/16, currently contract brewing.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"zn6uPI","name":"Unruly Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Unruly","description":"Provide awesome hand crafted beers in a one of a kind atmosphere that blends our attitude with a fully restored historic building from the 1890's.","website":"http:\/\/www.unrulybrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zn6uPI\/upload_2lAL9q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zn6uPI\/upload_2lAL9q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zn6uPI\/upload_2lAL9q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zn6uPI\/upload_2lAL9q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zn6uPI\/upload_2lAL9q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-20 00:07:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:40:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"92C4HIUMFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kxjm18","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"360 W.
