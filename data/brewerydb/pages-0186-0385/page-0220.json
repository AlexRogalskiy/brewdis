There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"s8dOIH","name":"Exile Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Exile","description":"Inspired by the countless immigrants who have made our country what it is today, Exile Brewing Co. is a hand-crafted brewery fueled by the passion of a burn-bright lifestyle, and driven by a unique sense of gratitude for the customer, community and future of our land.","website":"http:\/\/www.exilebrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s8dOIH\/upload_s3ZuZ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-29 13:51:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:43:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"E9HFY8LZNW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"xXJuyA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1514 Walnut Street","extendedAddress":"Des Moines","locality":"Des Moines","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50309","phone":"(515) 883-2337","website":"http:\/\/exilebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSaturday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSunday11AM\u20139PM\r\nMondayClosed\r\nTuesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nWednesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nThursday11AM\u201310PM","latitude":41.583013,"longitude":-93.637015,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-29 22:45:24","updateDate":"2018-08-24 17:00:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSaturday11AM\u201311PM\r\nSunday11AM\u20139PM\r\nMondayClosed\r\nTuesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nWednesday11AM\u201310PM\r\nThursday11AM\u201310PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nUMgU1","name":"Blackberry Cabernet Pyment","nameDisplay":"Blackberry Cabernet Pyment","styleId":145,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 23:34:11","updateDate":"2018-05-23 15:00:33","style":{"id":145,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Fruit Melomel","shortName":"Fruit Melomel","description":"In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"jDg4xl","name":"BearWaters Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"BearWaters","description":"BearWaters Brewing Company is located in Canton, North Carolina in the beautiful Smoky Mountains of Western North Carolina.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"yW9KR5","name":"Taxman Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Taxman","description":"Taxman Brewing Company is dedicated to crafting unique, artisanal Belgian-American ales.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CJWEFB","name":"Blackberry Gold","nameDisplay":"Blackberry Gold","abv":"6","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-09 13:05:41","updateDate":"2016-07-09 13:05:41","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

Just down the road is the historic Honey Run Covered Bridge that appears on our wine labels and corks. The winery has been in Southern Chico since 1995, and we love visitors!","website":"http:\/\/www.honeyrun.com\/","established":"1992","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 18:29:42","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Bn8kdV","name":"Honeyrun Winery & Honey Company","streetAddress":"2309 Park Ave","locality":"Chico","region":"California","postalCode":"95928","phone":"(530) 345-6405","website":"www.honeyrunwinery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SaturdayClosed\r\nSundayClosed","latitude":39.7165836,"longitude":-121.8172081,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"meadery","locationTypeDisplay":"Meadery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 20:39:34","updateDate":"2018-05-10 20:39:34","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"3:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"3:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"3:30pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"3:30pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"3:30pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-9:00am-3:30pm,fri-11:00am-3:00pm,mon-9:00am-3:30pm,tue-9:00am-3:30pm,wed-9:00am-3:30pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"SaturdayClosed\r\nSundayClosed","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"F1wphN","name":"Blackberry IPA","nameDisplay":"Blackberry IPA","description":"Crisp and refreshing, our Blackberry IPA brings together floral and citrus hop notes and finishes with a sweet blackberry backbone.","abv":"5","ibu":"35","srmId":10,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/F1wphN\/upload_lQzXCl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/F1wphN\/upload_lQzXCl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/F1wphN\/upload_lQzXCl-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/F1wphN\/upload_lQzXCl-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/F1wphN\/upload_lQzXCl-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/F1wphN\/upload_lQzXCl-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-10 14:41:23","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:00:55","srm":{"id":10,"name":"10","hex":"DE7C00"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The color reflects the choice of fruit. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"21","abvMin":"5.6","abvMax":"8.6","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"VjnZAd","name":"Upslope Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upslope","description":"Located in Boulder with two tap rooms (Flatiron Park & Lee Hill), Upslope taps into Colorado's active lifestyle by offering superior quality, hand-crafted ales & lagers in cans for the on-the-go beer enthusiast.\r\n\r\nAscend to New Heights.","website":"http:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/#","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2019-07-20 13:02:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"09JBTMX3RW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"89FEzM","name":"Lee Hill","streetAddress":"1501 Lee Hill Road No. 20","locality":"Boulder","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80304","phone":"720-379-7528","website":"http:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/","latitude":40.0628561,"longitude":-105.2791958,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-03-08 13:42:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-8:00pm,tue-2:00pm-8:00pm,wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-2:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ha3HrR","name":"Flatiron Park","streetAddress":"1898 S.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"efhAJx","name":"Crook & Marker","nameShortDisplay":"Crook & Marker","description":"With Crook & Marker, we\u2019re going to battle with the traditional shepherds of the alcohol industry to prove that people can feel better about what they drink while still having a good time.

Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived.

Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"9gPqS1","name":"Random Row Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Random Row","description":"Local neighborhood brewery specializing in drinkable, traditional beer styles in a welcoming, modern industrial taproom.
