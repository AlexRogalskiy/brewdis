This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"UEzK6I","name":"North End Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"North End","description":"We\u2019re a small brewery on the Kapiti Coast formed by a brewer, a waiter and a chef.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?? and we didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2t stop there.

The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.\n\nWe used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\n\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.

Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

The variety of ways they can be used in brewing and the range of flavors and aromas that they bring to beer are vast and areas in which we enjoy experimenting heavily. No surprise then that the word \"hop\" appears in our name and that the majority of our recipes begin with a specific variety or intuitive blend of hops in mind.\r\n\r\nHow we are inspired by the \"Butcher\" portion of our namesake is thankfully less bloody than the history behind it, but there are a lot of butcher-esque traits that we do draw inspiration from. All of the ones we grew up around were approachable, dependable and visibly and vocally passionate about their craft. They'd take the time to get to know you, get technical when necessary and if you wanted it, help you find something or make a recommendation. That's who we aim to be, except with hops, yeast, water and grain in a brewery instead of a butcher shop and a meat-filled counter.\r\n\r\nFinally, at some point, you'll refer to us simply as \"Hop Butcher\" (and we're cool with that), but the \"For The World\" part is an important and meaningful element of our name. It inspires the ingredients we use and the personality behind the beers we brew: unique enough for the beer geeks, approachable enough for the newcomers.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
