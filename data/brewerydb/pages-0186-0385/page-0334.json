This BIG, good ol\u2019 boy is Scottish to the core. He is bold, but absolutely loveable. Once you get to know MacBubba, you won\u2019t know how you went anywhere without him. This Scotch Ale has a subtle smoky undertone not found in many other beers. Starting with a beautiful dark-amber color it has a nice rich aroma that follows with a full bodied caramel flavor. You will note a\r\nslight \u201cpeaty\u201d character in the finish, derived from the addition of some of the finest Peated Malt from Scotland. We think you will find this Scotch Ale very easy to enjoy while still bold enough to stand up to a harsh winter chill.","abv":"6.5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":7,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7nI490\/upload_Qf4Ohy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7nI490\/upload_Qf4Ohy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7nI490\/upload_Qf4Ohy-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7nI490\/upload_Qf4Ohy-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7nI490\/upload_Qf4Ohy-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7nI490\/upload_Qf4Ohy-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"A perfect match with smoked meats, strong cheeses, and desserts.

Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"9","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.5","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"17","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:41"},"breweries":[{"id":"zhrpUi","name":"Custom Brewcrafters, Inc.","nameShortDisplay":"Custom Brewcrafters","description":"Custom BrewCrafters introduced to the market in 1997 an innovative micro-brewing concept in which they have partnered with dozens of local restaurant and tavern owners in offering unique signature craft-brews custom designed for each establishment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding this new dimension to the Western New York beer market, Custom BrewCrafters opened a tasting room and gift shop at the brewery in Honeoye Falls, where we introduce the public to the many unique custom brews as well as educate them on craft beer and microbrewing.","website":"http:\/\/www.custombrewcrafters.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zhrpUi\/upload_KkvSkx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zhrpUi\/upload_KkvSkx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zhrpUi\/upload_KkvSkx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zhrpUi\/upload_KkvSkx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zhrpUi\/upload_KkvSkx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vODMhk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"300 Village Square Blvd.","locality":"Honeoye Falls","region":"New York","postalCode":"14472","phone":"(716) 624-4386","website":"http:\/\/www.custombrewcrafters.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nTuesday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nWednesday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nThursday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nFriday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nSaturday\t10:00 am \u2013 6:00 pm\r\nSunday\t12:00\u20136:00 pm","latitude":42.9505606,"longitude":-77.602661,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nTuesday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nWednesday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nThursday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nFriday\t12:00\u20138:00 pm\r\nSaturday\t10:00 am \u2013 6:00 pm\r\nSunday\t12:00\u20136:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BTxrsL","name":"CBBB (Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Bourbon Barrel)","nameDisplay":"CBBB (Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Bourbon Barrel)","abv":"14.5","styleId":148,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 23:54:19","updateDate":"2018-05-23 20:19:03","style":{"id":148,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Open Category Mead","shortName":"Mead","description":"This mead should exhibit the character of all of the ingredients in varying degrees, and should show a good blending or balance between the various flavor elements.

Craft beer enthusiast and newly appointed manager of Cedric\u2019s Tavern, Bryan McIntosh has led the style selection of these new brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.biltmore.com\/our_wine\/Biltmore_Brewing\/Cedrics_Beer\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cqA8ox\/upload_hCLMOt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cqA8ox\/upload_hCLMOt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cqA8ox\/upload_hCLMOt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cqA8ox\/upload_hCLMOt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cqA8ox\/upload_hCLMOt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:20:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"XHJ0WESC3N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5Cl0ab","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Antler Hill Road","locality":"Asheville","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28803","phone":"828-225-1333","website":"http:\/\/www.biltmore.com\/our_wine\/Biltmore_Brewing\/Cedrics_Beer\/","latitude":35.557734,"longitude":-82.580672,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KmaXDc","name":"Ceili Irish Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Ceili Irish Red Ale","description":"Let us introduce, CEiL\u00ed, a smooth and easy-drinking traditional Irish Red Ale.

The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born.

The farm is a historic site, dating back to the Civil War, and is officially known as \u201cThe Encampment\u201d as the farm was used as a camp for Union soldiers leading up to the battle of Antietam.\r\nFollowing the Civil War, a fire destroyed most of the farmhouse. It was rebuilt in the 1890\u2019s on its original foundation. Today, the farmhouse, adjacent carriage house, and Civil War-era barn foundation still stand on the property. Additional buildings, such as the cider house and barns, were added later, designed to maintain the historic appearance and integrity of the property and surrounding area.\r\nRob Miller, his wife, Patty Power, and their three children moved to the farm in 2001. Prior to the Millers, the farm had never been used as an apple orchard. However, having always been cider fans (both fresh and hard cider) and with the farm located in a prime region to grow apples, they decided to enter the cider-making world.\r\nThe operation has been a family-affair from the beginning: fifteen of the Millers\u2019 extended family came to plant the initial 1,000 trees one weekend in the spring of 2001. By 2006, the trees were producing enough fruit to make the first batches of fresh cider. At this point, construction on the cider house commenced.\r\nBy 2008, the cider house was officially completed and approved to be open for business. During this time, numerous home-brew cider-makers discovered the farm and would buy fresh cider to take home and ferment into hard cider. Tim Rose, one of the home-brewers, had come back several times with refreshing cider and well-researched advice for the Millers\u2019 cider making. Tim was invited to join the family-owned and operated farm as the official cidermaker for Distillery Lane Ciderwork. He has since moved from carboys in his basement to his own building with stainless steel tanks!\r\nOpened for business as an official Maryland winery in 2010, Distillery Lane Ciderworks took its name from the rich history of the area. The whole valley was dotted with beer and whiskey-producing distilleries up until Prohibition. The remains of one of these distilleries can still be seen today down the road from the farm in the woods.\r\nDistillery Lane Ciderworks was the first licensed cidery in Maryland. More trees have been planted since 2001 and the orchard is now nine acres (over 3,000 trees)!\r\nSince 2010, the business has been featured in articles in media outlets such as The Washington Post and on the hit television show, \u201cDrinking Made Easy,\u201d where the host, Zane Lamprey, and his stuffed monkey, Pleepleus, visited the farm and tasted some of the cider.
