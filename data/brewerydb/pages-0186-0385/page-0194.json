New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"aW4MI3","name":"Alluvial Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Alluvial","description":"Focused on the highest quality ales and experience.","website":"http:\/\/www.alluvialbrewing.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@alluvialbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-04 03:47:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:35:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"W7T9G4V1AM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"oKwTQ7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3715 West 190th St.","locality":"Ames","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50014","website":"http:\/\/www.alluvialbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4-10 pm\r\nFriday 4-10 pm\r\nSaturday 12-10 pm\r\nSunday 12-6 pm","latitude":42.0797398,"longitude":-93.6666199,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-04 03:47:07","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:15:05","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4-10 pm\r\nFriday 4-10 pm\r\nSaturday 12-10 pm\r\nSunday 12-6 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EcEVZn","name":"Big Yuchi IPA","nameDisplay":"Big Yuchi IPA","description":"Big Yuchi (uchee) creek, about 12 miles from the brewery and a place where locals grew up swimming and and enjoying the summer, is named for a band of local Indians that inhabited the land prior to it being settled by the white man. they lived and thrived along this creek and hunted and fished the area along its banks until they were driven out along with the creeks and others to settle in northeastern Oklahoma.\r\n \r\nThis hearty and hoppy 7.5% abv beer is our version of and American IPA.
