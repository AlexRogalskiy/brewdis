For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Usually dark barley malts are used in conjunction with dark cara or color malts, and the percentage of wheat malt is at least 50 percent. If this is served with yeast, the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:09"},"breweries":[{"id":"1Lis85","name":"Oasis Texas Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Oasis Texas","description":"Producing iconic, rustic beers in the heart of the Texas Hill Country","website":"http:\/\/otxbc.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1Lis85\/upload_romrvI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-22 14:18:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:52:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"87XFDW9O4C","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"s6xmV6","name":"Oasis Texas Brewing Company","streetAddress":"6550 Comanche Trail","extendedAddress":"Suite 301","locality":"Austin","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78732","website":"http:\/\/otxbc.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":30.4058986,"longitude":-97.8739516,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-22 14:20:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XpEDsa","name":"Caribbean Chocolate Cake","nameDisplay":"Caribbean Chocolate Cake","description":"Collaboration with Cigar City.

With the success of our Genuine Draft the Honey Lager is an excellent addition to the family and the beer itself is a crowd pleaser!\r\n\r\nThe Cariboo Honey Lager has a hint of honey that gives the beer a nice body and it will leave with you with a pleasantly warm and smooth finish that has little residual sweetness and goes very well with the Cariboo Brewing philosophy. We did not want to create a beer that was too sweet or that had an overbearing honey flavor. Great with spicy food or roast chicken.","abv":"5.5","availableId":1,"styleId":126,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H3x16D\/upload_HVdmMI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H3x16D\/upload_HVdmMI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H3x16D\/upload_HVdmMI-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H3x16D\/upload_HVdmMI-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H3x16D\/upload_HVdmMI-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H3x16D\/upload_HVdmMI-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-31 13:09:34","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:22:02","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":126,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Honey Lager or Ale","shortName":"Honey Beer","description":"These beers are brewed using honey in addition to malted barley.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EHRB4SUDWI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
