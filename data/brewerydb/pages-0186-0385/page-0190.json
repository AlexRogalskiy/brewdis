By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

There he learned the trade of cellar work and brewing beer.\r\n\r\nWhen Pyramid closed its doors in Seattle, Brett moved on to work for a small brewery in south Seattle.  He soon became head brewer and was put in charge of training new employees and developing new beers.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 he and his family moved back to Dillon, there the town needed a brewer and Brett needed a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name for Beaverhead Brewing Company comes from the original brewery in Dillon which operated in the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s.  Little is known about the original Beaverhead Brewery (Dillon Brewery) but newspaper clipping mention it was regarded as making the \u201cFinest Beer.\u201d  Owned and operated at one time by Henry Burfiend and his brother, the Brewery closed in 1919 at the start of Prohibition.

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy.

Although Big Horn Brewing Company is now one of the largest brewpub companies in the country, the goal of our brewers continues to be to produce the freshest, most \u201cdrinkable\u201d beer of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com\/","established":"1971","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Qg6dpg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1650 Dell Range Boulevard","locality":"Cheyenne","region":"Wyoming","postalCode":"82001","phone":"307-632-8636","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com\/","latitude":41.160727,"longitude":-104.801787,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1971","yearClosed":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"nTzKAN","name":"Highlands Ranch","streetAddress":"43 W Centennial Blvd","locality":"Highlands Ranch","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80126","phone":"720-344-1200","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com","hoursOfOperation":"Monday -

Although Big Horn Brewing Company is now one of the largest brewpub companies in the country, the goal of our brewers continues to be to produce the freshest, most \u201cdrinkable\u201d beer of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com\/","established":"1971","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Qg6dpg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1650 Dell Range Boulevard","locality":"Cheyenne","region":"Wyoming","postalCode":"82001","phone":"307-632-8636","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com\/","latitude":41.160727,"longitude":-104.801787,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1971","yearClosed":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"nTzKAN","name":"Highlands Ranch","streetAddress":"43 W Centennial Blvd","locality":"Highlands Ranch","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80126","phone":"720-344-1200","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com","hoursOfOperation":"Monday -

The Micro Brewing Company and Restaurant is known as a neighborhood icon in Fresno. Scott and Michele changed the name to wholesale their beer throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nKevin continued on as Sequoia's Brewmaster, putting together a creative mix of 11 unique ales and lagers on tap brewed with the finest ingredients including monthly special beers, wines, specialty drinks, and their homemade Root Beer. Recently, Rick Bouke took over as Brewmaster, and is responsible for the high quality and craft beer character our customers have come to expect. Sequoia's menu offers great food with the freshest ingredients, serves Certified Angus Beef, prepares their sauces and items from scratch and offers fresh daily fish.\r\n\r\nSequoia offers a menu for all ages in a warm and comfortable atmosphere, where everyone knows your name. Sequoia is a hot spot for live music featuring the best local bands and a private party room. A second location with a mountain lodge atmosphere, rock fireplace and a patio was opened in Northeast Fresno in July of 2005 at Piazza del Fiore. Along with the same great beers on tap, there is a full bar at the Champlain location.","website":"http:\/\/www.sequoiabrewing.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2019-10-22 19:07:40","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ETI0V8UH23","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WPIz5n","name":"Tower District","streetAddress":"777 East Olive Avenue","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","postalCode":"93728","phone":"559-264-5521","website":"http:\/\/www.sequoiabrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Wed 11am - 10pm\r\nThur 11am - 11pm\r\nFri - Sat 11am - Midnight\r\nSunday 10am - 10pm\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOUR\r\nMon - Fri 3pm - 6pm\r\nSat 1pm-4pm\r\nSun 10am - 12pm. 1pm - 4pm","latitude":36.758189,"longitude":-119.801674,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Wed 11am - 10pm\r\nThur 11am - 11pm\r\nFri - Sat 11am - Midnight\r\nSunday 10am - 10pm\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOUR\r\nMon - Fri 3pm - 6pm\r\nSat 1pm-4pm\r\nSun 10am - 12pm. 1pm - 4pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"HcnHXH","name":"North Fresno","streetAddress":"1188 E.
