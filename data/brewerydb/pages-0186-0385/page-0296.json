In 2012, a group of Colorado Natives formed the Tivoli Brewing Company to bring this Colorado legend back to life. Our current Brewery and Taphouse were re-opened in August 2015 and we have been privileged in recreating historical recipes as well as new, innovative brews ever since.","website":"http:\/\/tivolibrewingco.com\/","established":"1859","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hg8V7d\/upload_YBS5kJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hg8V7d\/upload_YBS5kJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hg8V7d\/upload_YBS5kJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hg8V7d\/upload_YBS5kJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hg8V7d\/upload_YBS5kJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2019-01-31 20:08:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HZ1KO2W58L","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"TNnvJV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"900 Auraria Pkwy","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80204","phone":"720-458-5885","website":"http:\/\/tivolibrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Friday 10:00am - 10:00pm\r\n\r\nSaturday 11:00am - 10:00pm\r\n\r\nSunday 11:00am - 8:00pm","latitude":39.7453535,"longitude":-105.0059505,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-08-14 20:01:05","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Friday 10:00am - 10:00pm\r\n\r\nSaturday 11:00am - 10:00pm\r\n\r\nSunday 11:00am - 8:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"3bk76G","name":"Tivoli Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"900 Auraria Parkway","extendedAddress":"#240","locality":"Denver","region":"CO","postalCode":"80204","phone":"720-458-5885","website":"www.tivolibrewingco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Friday 10:00am - 10:00pm\n\nSaturday 11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nSunday 11:00am - 8:00pm","latitude":39.7450774,"longitude":-105.005976,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-08-13 19:56:51","updateDate":"2018-08-14 20:01:06","forwardingId":"TNnvJV","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Friday 10:00am - 10:00pm\n\nSaturday 11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nSunday 11:00am - 8:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"07kY5V","name":"Brut-Ros\u00e9 IPA","nameDisplay":"Brut-Ros\u00e9 IPA","description":"IPA brewed with Champagne yeast.","abv":"6","ibu":"15","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-01-22 18:37:47","updateDate":"2019-01-22 18:37:47","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.

French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"a0ab7x","name":"Notch Brewery & Tap Room","nameShortDisplay":"Notch Brewing","description":"There is a myth born of the craft beer movement that flavorful beer is synonymous with high alcohol. The art of brewing great beer in the US without a debilitating ABV had seemed all but dead. Not anymore. Myths are simply myths, and beers of great flavor and quality have been brewed for hundreds of years in every great brewing nation except ours. Chris is not out to change the US craft beer world, but to simply brew the beers he loves to drink, and he thinks he is not alone.\r\n\r\nChris has been brewing professionally since 1993, first as an apprentice at Kennebunkport Brewing, then at the Tremont Brewery in Boston MA starting in 1994. Today, Chris is an independent brewer \u2013 he owns no facility \u2013 instead brewing and collaborating with other breweries. He currently brews his beers at two locations, the Ipswich Ale Brewery (Bottles & Draft) and Kennebunkport Brewery (Cask).","website":"http:\/\/www.notchsession.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a0ab7x\/upload_RrMnZ9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a0ab7x\/upload_RrMnZ9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a0ab7x\/upload_RrMnZ9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a0ab7x\/upload_RrMnZ9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a0ab7x\/upload_RrMnZ9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:47:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"APNGR71STW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"GDFP48","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23 Hayward St.","locality":"Ipswich","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01938","phone":"978-853-9138","website":"http:\/\/www.notchsession.com\/","latitude":42.672726,"longitude":-70.843912,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"q8LO3q","name":"Biergarten","streetAddress":"283 Derby St.","locality":"Salem","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01970","latitude":42.5199017,"longitude":-70.8908665,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-25 17:13:17","updateDate":"2016-06-08 19:40:12","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"y5cXag","name":"BSF Hard Apple Cider","nameDisplay":"BSF Hard Apple Cider","description":"Fresh, aromatic, ripe apple aromas mingle with a delicate spice on the palate.
