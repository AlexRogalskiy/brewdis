It\u2019s the story of a semi-lost 20 something year old with a young family, who fell in love with the art and science of brewing beer, instead of finishing college, like he was supposed to. He may well still be brewing in his garage at this very moment, if his retired father, Gary had not believed in his son, and offered to join him in business.\r\nGreg, with one small child and another on the way, somehow convinced his wife, Natalia that moving across two states and buying into a failing brewery was a good idea. If nothing else, Greg is persuasive. Three months into the social experiment, Gary, Greg\u2019s dad had the inspired idea to bring in Greg\u2019s good high school friend, Ross as a partner. Granted Ross was an English major (which has nothing to do with beer?), but hey, the guy can talk to anybody.\r\nAnd well, they did what anybody would do in their shoes. Worked all hours of the day for wages below poverty level. Talked to the people, found out what they wanted and made it. Poured beer at festivals all over the state. Shook hands. Begged for placements at bars. Picked up spare change off the sidewalk. Made big mistakes. Figured out how to correct them. Learned a few things the easy way. Learned a lot of things the hard way. And were grateful that at least they had access to nearly free beer.\r\nIn the process of struggling to make something out of very little, they figured out what Iron Horse Brewery really stood for. They weren\u2019t making beer to please the critics of the world, they were making craft beer for people. There are a lot of rules and regulations about how things should be, and when it comes to their beer and their lives, they don\u2019t care about rules. They care about innovation, taking risks, and authenticity.\r\nWith that core belief intact you have the Iron Horse Brewery of today; Greg continuing to push the envelope, Ross using a vernacular more appropriate to classical literature than selling beer, Gary suggesting barrier-busting, painfully optimistic future plans, Natalia still working in the business for the sole purpose of keeping Greg in check, and an amazing staff that keeps Iron Horse Beers moving into the hands of the people.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_YFHXsn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SlryVk","name":"Black IPA","nameDisplay":"Black IPA","description":"Dark in color and character, this unfiltered Black IPA exudes carmel and roasted notes while highlighting a bold hop bitterness and citrus aroma.

(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:20:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q8W2M631AI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TbZRfB","name":"Black IPA","nameDisplay":"Black IPA","abv":"6.5","ibu":"0","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-19 18:02:44","updateDate":"2016-01-06 21:44:35","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewage.at","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:45:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mMnrjZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mittelgasse 4","locality":"1060 Wien","phone":"+43 1 9550935","website":"http:\/\/brewage.at\/","latitude":48.1939642,"longitude":16.3434939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","updateDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-7:00pm,wed-2:00pm-7:00pm,thu-2:00pm-7:00pm,fri-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"Europe\/Vienna","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1J5gpU","name":"Black Irish","nameDisplay":"Black Irish","description":"A proper stout to call our own\u2026this brew is a quintessential Double Mountain interpretation of a classic style.

A variety of Columbus and Cascade hops were used quite generously to help balance out the large malt bill. This beer is abundant with in complex flavors and hop character and yet quite smooth for a beer that sits at 7.5% abv and 48 IBUs. Cheers!\r\n\r\nThe style \u201cIndia Black Ale\u201d is so new, that there\u2019s no one, all authoritative beer that we need to compare to. The trick is to get the balance between the malt bitterness and the hop bitterness. In this case we used non-astringent roasted malts to add the roasted flavors. The malt is a de-husked German black malt, it provides the color, and the roast flavor without the risk of extra acidity. It creates this intense roasted coffee and chocolate aroma. When we add the hops you\u2019ll get that pine and citrus smell. When we released the test batch last year it went over really well.
