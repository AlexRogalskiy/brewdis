This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:23:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A5CLS8HOXR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oPxIne","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23600 Overland Drive","extendedAddress":"#180","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"(703) 474-3050","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com","latitude":38.9629988,"longitude":-77.4992517,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:34","updateDate":"2016-03-22 17:54:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5QiD66","name":"Break On Through","nameDisplay":"Break On Through","description":"An abundance of hops fuel this dank and pungent DIPA concoction with just the right ingredients to help you see into another dimension.","abv":"8","ibu":"75","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-11-29 18:25:28","updateDate":"2018-11-29 18:25:28","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"64tyso","name":"Edmund's Oast","nameShortDisplay":"Edmund's Oast","description":"Why Edmund's Oast?\r\n\r\nThe \u201cEdmund\u201d in the name comes from Edmund Egan, who began producing beer in Charleston after emigrating from England in the 1760s. \"Oast\u201d is a kiln used in the drying of hops. \r\n\r\nEdmund's Oast!","website":"http:\/\/edmundsoast.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/64tyso\/upload_wUWde2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-09 12:54:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:47:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RMLN3G6YQT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5sySnW","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"1081 Morrison Drive","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29403","phone":"(843) 557-4077","website":"http:\/\/edmundsoast.com","latitude":32.809804,"longitude":-79.9479209,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-09 12:55:08","updateDate":"2014-09-29 18:07:49","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ErVFFR","name":"Edmund's Oast Brewery","streetAddress":"1505 King St.","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29403","phone":"8437183224","website":"http:\/\/edmundsoast.com\/brewing-co\/contact\/","latitude":32.8172486,"longitude":-79.9537193,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-20 15:58:50","updateDate":"2018-08-20 14:39:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QlztyB","name":"Breakfast Beagle","nameDisplay":"Breakfast Beagle","description":"IPA brewed with blood oranges.","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-29 18:16:39","updateDate":"2015-12-29 18:16:39","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

While most of it goes into cask, you'll also find it in keg or bottle if you look in the right places.","website":"http:\/\/arborales.co.uk\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-08 08:41:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"pguslr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unit 4 Lawrence Hill Industrial Park","extendedAddress":"Croydon Street","locality":"Lawrence Hill","region":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS5 0EB","latitude":51.4583567,"longitude":-2.5694249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:37:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"S0dgvI","name":"The Old Stillage","streetAddress":"147 Church Rd","extendedAddress":"Redfield","locality":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS5 9LA","phone":"0117 939 4079","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thu 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri 4pm-12am;\r\nSat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 12pm-10:30pm","latitude":51.4586634,"longitude":-2.5581766,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:40:12","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:12:59","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:30pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-11:00pm,tue-4:00pm-11:00pm,wed-4:00pm-11:00pm,thu-4:00pm-11:00pm,fri-4:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am,sun-12:00pm-10:30pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon-Thu 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri 4pm-12am;\r\nSat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 12pm-10:30pm","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"4KMV4j","name":"The Three Tuns","streetAddress":"78 Saint George's Road","extendedAddress":"Hotwells","locality":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS1 5UR","phone":"0117 907 0689","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thu 12pm-2.30pm & 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri-Sat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 4pm-10:30pm","latitude":51.4511176,"longitude":-2.6049702,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:41:57","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:13:00","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"2:30pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"2:30pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"2:30pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"2:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:30pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-12:00pm-2:30pm,tue-12:00pm-2:30pm,wed-12:00pm-2:30pm,thu-12:00pm-2:30pm,fri-12:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am,sun-4:00pm-10:30pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon-Thu 12pm-2.30pm & 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri-Sat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 4pm-10:30pm","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SgyyEC","name":"Breakfast Stout","nameDisplay":"Breakfast Stout","description":"This breakfast stout is brewed with an incredible malt combination of two-row, Oat Malt, and Perla Negra to bring to us this magnificent creamy mouthfeel like no other.
