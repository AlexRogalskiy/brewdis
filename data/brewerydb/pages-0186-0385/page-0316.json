Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nGreat success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","website":"http:\/\/www.lucidbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"www.LucidBrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"1xeovq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6020 Culligan Way","locality":"Minnetonka","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55345","phone":"612-810-9324","website":"http:\/\/lucidbrewing.wordpress.com\/","latitude":44.895218,"longitude":-93.449725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-03-23 19:15:17","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wqpdqy","name":"Camo","nameDisplay":"Camo","description":"We brewed this stout that hides in plain sight as a pale-colored ale.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:06:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0TCEK1B5X9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"klKTB8","name":"Campaign Trail Ale","nameDisplay":"Campaign Trail Ale","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/klKTB8\/upload_OsKAdQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/klKTB8\/upload_OsKAdQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/klKTB8\/upload_OsKAdQ-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/klKTB8\/upload_OsKAdQ-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/klKTB8\/upload_OsKAdQ-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/klKTB8\/upload_OsKAdQ-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:56","updateDate":"2018-11-02 15:50:32","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

Overnight, a legacy was born. At first Scrumpy\u2019s existed simply as a mere hallway and small fermentation room. But after a 4-month renovation ending in April of 2016, we tripled in size after expanding into the neighboring, recently vacated space, to create the beautiful tap house you see today.\r\n\r\nNow, questions tend to arise when talking about Scrumpy\u2019s (the tap house) versus Summit (the cidery). We call our tap house Scrumpy\u2019s as to not limit our tap selection to just Summit Hard Cider. Our tap house is indeed the home of Summit Hard Cider, and offers 48 rotating taps, including everything from beer and cider to wine and mead. We also get asked \u201cWhat\u2019s a \u2018scrumpy?\u2019\u201d The term \u2018scrumpy\u2019 is defined as cider made from unwanted, undesirable, or fallen apples, and that typically has a high alcohol content. Scrumpy\u2019s Hard Cider has the logo of a hedgehog because Rodney always wanted to have a pet hedgehog growing up and was never able to house one. However, there is indeed a real live Scrumpy the hedgehog, although he now lives in New York.\r\n\r\nNot only do we have a passion for fantastic cider with flavors ranging from the familiar  to the wonky and unusual, but we also have a passion for utilizing all that the earth has given to us. After acquiring Branch Out Cider in the summer of 2016, we have been able to reduce excess waste in the Fort Collins community by harvesting undesirable apples that would normally be thrown out, in return creating a beautiful product for those of legal drinking age to enjoy. We extended this effort in earning a grant to operate a Mobile Juicing unit along the Western Slope, harvesting farmers\u2019 rejected and downright ugly apples, cherries, peaches, and other fruits of the like. Scrumpy\u2019s Hard Cider Bar, along with Summit Hard Cider is a groundbreaking company that has only just begun to change the face of cider and the way we see fruit everywhere.","website":"http:\/\/www.scrumpys.net\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LbCble\/upload_5B2PzO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LbCble\/upload_5B2PzO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LbCble\/upload_5B2PzO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LbCble\/upload_5B2PzO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LbCble\/upload_5B2PzO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:43:34","updateDate":"2019-08-14 14:40:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NIsek5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"215 North College Avenue","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"(970) 682-1944","website":"http:\/\/www.scrumpys.net\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","latitude":40.5894928,"longitude":-105.0775129,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:43:36","updateDate":"2018-08-17 19:43:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AvdxZD","name":"CAMPFIRE","nameDisplay":"CAMPFIRE","description":"Campfire was brewed with caramel, roasted and smoked malts to give a unique and delicate malt flavor.
