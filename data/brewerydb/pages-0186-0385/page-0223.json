English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels.

What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

It's still less vigorous than most modern hop varieties, but easier to grow in most areas than the very fussy Fuggle. Willamette has a mild, grassy, floral and slightly spicy aroma similar to Fuggle, and is often used as a substitute, especially in the United States where Fuggle does not grow well. Willamette is extensively planted in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.","countryOfOrigin":"US","alphaAcidMin":4,"betaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMax":4.5,"humuleneMin":20,"humuleneMax":30,"caryophylleneMin":7,"caryophylleneMax":8,"cohumuloneMin":30,"cohumuloneMax":35,"myrceneMin":30,"myrceneMax":55,"farneseneMin":5,"farneseneMax":6,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:39","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":186,"name":"Black Roast","category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:41"},{"id":378,"name":"Caramel\/Crystal Malt","category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:45"},{"id":536,"name":"Oats - Flaked","category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:50"},{"id":854,"name":"Wheat Malt","category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:56"}]}},{"id":"roLpF6","name":"Blackwater","nameDisplay":"Blackwater","description":"Floridian Dark Ale","glasswareId":5,"styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:51","updateDate":"2014-10-14 20:25:43","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley. Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"lh4CHM","name":"Swamp Head Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Swamp Head","description":"Founded in 2008, upon the foundation of our great state, we raised our roof to brew world-class beers and establish ourselves as Florida\u2019s brewery.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","abvMin":"3.75","abvMax":"6.5","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"gPIMJE","name":"Turtle Anarchy Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Turtle Anarchy","description":"Turtle Anarchy Brewing Company is a family owned microbrewery in Franklin, TN specializing in craft brewed ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.turtleanarchy.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gPIMJE\/upload_Vl1EL6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gPIMJE\/upload_Vl1EL6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gPIMJE\/upload_Vl1EL6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gPIMJE\/upload_Vl1EL6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gPIMJE\/upload_Vl1EL6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-30 16:16:39","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:37:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"D0BN5KY83Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vfNxhc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"216 Noah Drive","extendedAddress":"Ste. 140","locality":"Franklin","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37064","phone":"(615) 595-8855","website":"http:\/\/www.turtleanarchy.com\/","latitude":35.894663,"longitude":-86.866396,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-01 13:02:21","updateDate":"2015-09-02 18:05:52","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
