In our Garage, you can find what drives us \u2014 quality craft beer.\r\n\r\n\u200bEstablished in 2013, we began brewing in what was once an eight bay garage at the end of Old Town Temecula. The brewpub and taproom was aptly named Garage Brewing Co, not only due to its previous life, but to show an appreciation to where the craft beer industry originated \u2014 in the garages of brewers. Here, we have created a family-friendly environment where our fast-fired, Kustom-built pizzas and quality, Kustom craft beers provide unlimited possibilities of flavor while bringing friends and family together. In 2016, we expanded our business and now also have an off-site, full production brewery in Murrieta, CA.\r\n\r\n\u200bFrom the beginning, we set out on a mission: to provide top-quality craft beer that tastes fantastic and appeals to a broad spectrum of beer lovers. We are committed to excellence and only use the finest ingredients, state-of-the art equipment, and top-notch coding processes.\r\n\r\n\u200bWe maintain six core, year-round styles while also regularly rotating in seasonal creations for a total of \u00b1 15 beers on tap at all times.  As an independent brewery, we are free to modify beer recipes and develop exciting and creative spins on standard styles to please all types of beer advocates.  We routinely offer new and interesting beers to bring our customers a truly unique experience. \r\n \r\nOur brewery equipment was manufacured in North America by a company that has built over 350 breweries and has over 25 years of experience in the craft brewing industry. This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves an exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:24:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:47:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYX5KUDZEG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Jki0lE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29095 Old Town Front Street","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 587-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":33.4825051,"longitude":-117.1432478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"f3iaxk","name":"Chocolate Ginger Stout","nameDisplay":"Chocolate Ginger Stout","abv":"9","ibu":"36","glasswareId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-23 18:33:41","updateDate":"2017-05-08 19:27:17","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:22:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5NJLHA2D94","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"M4WyNr","name":"Chocolate Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Chocolate Milk Stout","description":"Low roast, light chocolate with a hint of coffee.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.
