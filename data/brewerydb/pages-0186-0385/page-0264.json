This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"mOFDzh","name":"Sun King Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sun King","description":"Sun King Brewing Company is an Indianapolis-based craft brewery with a focus on continually creating traditional seasonal and unique specialty beers. \r\n\r\nSun King rolled its first keg of beer out the door in July 2009 and since that time has grown into the second largest brewery in Indiana, producing over 27,000 barrels of beer in 2014 while selling all of it in Indiana.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"5lZzL3","name":"Blue Stallion Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Blue Stallion","description":"Blue Stallion Brewing Co. is the newest craft brewery in Lexington, Kentucky.

Years of minor tweaks, arguments over hop profiles, and experiments with different brands of base malts are poured into every glass that we brew.","website":"http:\/\/mondaynightbrewing.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:59:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"K3IB1ZDXWV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"pGgCWL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"670 Trabert Ave","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30318","phone":"(404) 352-7703","website":"http:\/\/mondaynightbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nThu: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm","latitude":33.794919,"longitude":-84.40989,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2018-06-05 19:59:01","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nThu: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RYTrew","name":"Monday NIght Garage","streetAddress":"933 Lee St. SW","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30310","website":"http:\/\/www.mondaynightbrewing.com\/garage","latitude":33.729001,"longitude":-84.4174307,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-05 19:37:39","updateDate":"2018-06-05 19:59:00","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xVKutU","name":"Bourbon Barrel Dragonslayer","nameDisplay":"Bourbon Barrel Dragonslayer","description":"This version of our imperial stout Dragonslayer has been aged in Bourbon Barrels for over 6 months.","abv":"12.5","availableId":2,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-10 15:52:54","updateDate":"2016-09-16 17:34:03","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"sitjIr","name":"Mt.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"beerVariation":{"id":"MZmU0u","name":"Golden One","nameDisplay":"Golden One","abv":"7","ibu":"24","styleId":61,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-31 15:15:49","updateDate":"2015-12-17 03:17:27","style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.

Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ll00zf","name":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jackie O's","description":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery prides itself in creating neo-traditional handcrafted artisan ales.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-09-03 12:33:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"12HYVPGOJF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Fegley's Allentown Brew Works","streetAddress":"812 W Hamilton St","locality":"Allentown","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18101","phone":"610.433.7777","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com\/allentown-brewworks\/","latitude":40.6013531,"longitude":-75.4739451,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"SAPoSh","name":"Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works","streetAddress":"569 Main Street","locality":"Bethlehem","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18018","phone":"610-882-1300","latitude":40.6222629,"longitude":-75.3821851,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YOYH4M","name":"Bourbon Barrel L'Abondance","nameDisplay":"Bourbon Barrel L'Abondance","description":"Bourbon barrel aged saison.","styleId":132,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-02-14 15:50:04","updateDate":"2017-02-14 15:53:35","style":{"id":132,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ll00zf","name":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jackie O's","description":"Jackie O's Pub and Brewery prides itself in creating neo-traditional handcrafted artisan ales.

It\u2019s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the \u201cblueprint\u201d for great beer was born! Eric\u2019s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.\r\n\r\nBetter than a recipe, a brewing \u201cblueprint\u201d combines science and great culinary skill to create a Br\u00fceprint.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery\u2014Br\u00fceprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Br\u00fceprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer.
