Fruity-estery aroma and flavor from yeast can be typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clovelike characteristics should not be perceived. Body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Hop bitterness, flavor and aroma are negligible to very light. Light fruity esters are acceptable. Chill haze and diacetyl should be absent.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"13","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:39:26"},"breweries":[{"id":"VoKbnS","name":"Victory Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Victory","description":"Having trained in Germany, we appreciate the artistic freedom we have here in the US.

Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.
