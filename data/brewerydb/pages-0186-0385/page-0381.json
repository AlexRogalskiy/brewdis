Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Blending these barrels into funky, complex and sometimes sour beer is an historical art form that we celebrate in our space.\r\n\r\nOur experimentation also extends to that most important of beer ingredients, yeast. Many Springdale beers are fermented with classic ale yeast strains, rather than our parent brewery\u2019s lager yeasts. These yeasts express themselves in our beers with spicy, fruity characteristics that are classic in many styles that we have have long loved, such as saison.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the ideal that beer needs to remain fun. Our space is decked out with pinball, skeeball, arcade games and other classics that remind us of birthday parties of our youth.\r\n\r\nWhy ale?!\r\nJack\u2019s Abby Craft Lagers was founded in 2011 by brothers Jack, Eric and Sam Hendler with the goal of brewing world-class, German-style lagers. After several years of expansion, the brothers decided that the challenge of working with ale yeasts and sour cultures was too tempting to pass up.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"uoQoRs","name":"Uinta Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Uinta","description":"Named after the only major east-west running mountain range located in the continental U.S., Uinta Brewing Company's journey began in 1993 with the reality that passion for craft beer and a hankering for the great outdoors could align in Salt Lake City, UT.\r\n \r\nBuilt on an axis point that endorses sustainability, community involvement and innovation, their compass guides them on a path to admirable, consistent craft beer leading consumers to discover a brand with passion, personality and soul.

Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"jZrVLA","name":"Coastal Empire Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Coastal Empire","description":"Artisan ales and lagers.","website":"http:\/\/coastalempirebeer.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jZrVLA\/upload_eCcqPb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jZrVLA\/upload_eCcqPb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jZrVLA\/upload_eCcqPb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jZrVLA\/upload_eCcqPb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jZrVLA\/upload_eCcqPb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:30:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GN4RT2UB97","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"v4tN9z","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Savannah","region":"Georgia","website":"http:\/\/coastalempirebeer.com\/","latitude":32.08078,"longitude":-81.090719,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EVy05x","name":"Coco Rasa","nameDisplay":"Coco Rasa","description":"A deep roasted malt porter, with cacao nibs, vanilla beans and toasted coconut.
