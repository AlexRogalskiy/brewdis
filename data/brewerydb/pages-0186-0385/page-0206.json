The sweeteners we use in our brewing process are also sourced locally, and our production takes place in our cidery at the Genesee Regional Market in Rochester. We believe our cider is different \u2013 more authentic, more drinkable, more responsibly produced, more of an experience \u2013 than the more mass-produced ciders that may use imported apples. We hope you\u2019ll treat yourself to a bottle or glass of our hard cider soon to savor that difference.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CKxaVJ","name":"Black Cherry Saison","nameDisplay":"Black Cherry Saison","description":"Cherries deliver a tartness balanced by malt sweetness.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Xknbgp","name":"Mother's Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Mother's","description":"Mother's is a growing family that's all about heady craft beers.

Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambicstyle\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet. Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8.1","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:34"},"breweries":[{"id":"l4QDBq","name":"Syracuse Suds Factory","nameShortDisplay":"Syracuse Suds Factory","description":"The Syracuse Suds Factory was founded on January 19th, 1993.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"Boa6td","name":"Perrin Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Perrin","description":"Located 10 minutes north of downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan, our micro brewery and taproom is striving to bring a world class experience to every person who walks through our doors.\r\n\r\nWith a hospitality philosophy of treating our customers like they're guests in our home, we look forward to serving you.","website":"http:\/\/www.perrinbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","mailingListUrl":"connor@perrinbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 11:40:02","updateDate":"2019-10-11 21:14:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CRE5z9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5910 Comstock Park Drive","locality":"Comstock Park","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49321","phone":"(616) 551-1957","website":"http:\/\/www.perrinbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.0710876,"longitude":-85.6814504,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 11:41:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:28:50","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-12:00pm-8:00pm,wed-4:00pm-11:00pm,thu-4:00pm-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oyQJtN","name":"Black Currant Gose","nameDisplay":"Black Currant Gose","description":"This kettle sour is tart, fruity, and slightly salty.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Each of our beers is associated with the dogs from the kennel as a tribute to the loyalty and companionship that defined each of them.\r\n\r\nWhile not in our original plans, Black Husky began getting calls from bars and restaurants in Milwaukee to see if they could purchase our beers. So we began driving down kegs and bottles to Milwaukee in our Ford Transit Connect van. First two or three kegs and cases and eventually we were turning business away so the poor van didn\u2019t collapse under the load.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Black Husky moved its brewery operations to the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee where we operate a taproom and produce our beers. Not much has changed. Sure there is a bigger building and a few more people in the team but the beer is still delivered in our van, and the same care and dedication to produce the best beer is still practiced to honor the 23 dogs that spent their lives with us.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhuskybrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2019-09-21 11:38:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DJS4M3UBIZ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"lnGqhM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"909 E Locust","locality":"Milwaukee","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53212","phone":"715-324-5152","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhuskybrewing.com\/","latitude":43.0710218,"longitude":-87.9002127,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2017-10-31 17:33:41","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"krF10F","name":"Black Currant Maibock","nameDisplay":"Black Currant Maibock","description":"An ample head retreats revealing mildly sweet maltiness and modest hop bitterness.

St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done.

With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe deed of Boniface provides an elegant analogy for our own mission at Saint Boniface Craft Brewing Co. Mike and Jon have witnessed many beer \u201cpagans\u201d worshiping the false gods of the big beer industry and see that it is time to take a Boniface-like swing at converting some of those people to a better way of life, one full of rich, tasty, more satisfying brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.stbonifacebrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0o5iQ6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1701 West Main Street","locality":"Ephrata","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17522","phone":"717-466-6900","website":"http:\/\/www.stbonifacebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nWednesday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nThursday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nFriday: 11:00AM - 10:30PM\r\nSaturday: 11:00AM - 10:30PM","latitude":40.2003364,"longitude":-76.2054223,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2017-07-11 20:40:08","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tuesday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nWednesday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nThursday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nFriday: 11:00AM - 10:30PM\r\nSaturday: 11:00AM - 10:30PM","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
