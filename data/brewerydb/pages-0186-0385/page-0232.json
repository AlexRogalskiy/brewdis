Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

These will just be a few of the ales we will be offering as we expand into seasonal batches, plus we just started our PRO-AM line of brews where home brewers can compete to have their recipe produced at our brewery(with the help of the creators if they desire). The winning entry will also be entered into the GABF. \r\n\r\nThanks to the help of our five distributors, we are able to get our brews to a variety of locations(including grocery stores, beverage shops, pubs and restaurants) throughout Texas and a few other states including Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and South Carolina. Unfortunately due to laws in Texas we can't tell you where you can buy our beers, but we are working at trying to get them to as many of your favorite craft beer establishments as possible.","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:26:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Z3WG95PJN1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Yr1UcD","name":"Southern Star Brewing Company","streetAddress":"3525 N Frazier","locality":"Conroe","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77303","phone":"936-441-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","latitude":30.3585757,"longitude":-95.4741966,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:45:56","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"47dnxE","name":"Blood Belt","nameDisplay":"Blood Belt","description":"Blood Belt is a twist on our classic standard Pine Belt.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nUT6v5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2072 Stoneman Circle","locality":"Lakewood","region":"New York","postalCode":"14750","phone":"716-763-5479","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1008305,"longitude":-79.3356897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-27 14:23:02","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OJrSkt","name":"Southern Tier Brewing Company-Pittsburgh","streetAddress":"316 N Shore Dr.","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15212","phone":"(412) 301-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.stbcbeer.com\/capabilities-view\/about-stbc-pittsburgh\/","latitude":40.4463787,"longitude":-80.0104128,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-09 00:10:10","updateDate":"2018-04-10 14:11:48","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9SEVNm","name":"Blood Brood","nameDisplay":"Blood Brood","description":"Just in time for spring, this German Hefeweizen hatches from the bitter Ohio cold with familiar aromas of banana and spice.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.
