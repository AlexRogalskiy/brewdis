The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:48:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"K240B5MRS1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"C0PCXr","name":"Black Lagoon","nameDisplay":"Black Lagoon","abv":"8","availableId":3,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 17:40:55","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
