Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:51:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SJAKR7MLFP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"General Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YHTBtO","name":"Blizzard of Oz","nameDisplay":"Blizzard of Oz","glasswareId":4,"availableId":4,"styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:51","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:34","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-07-10 21:56:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"BJ7YQKPT31","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"yqQtUG","name":"Brewery & Restaurant","streetAddress":"21 Second Street","locality":"Athens","region":"New York","postalCode":"12015","phone":"518-945-2337","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon, Wed & Thurs.: 4:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nFriday: 4:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSaturday: 1:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSunday: 1:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nClosed Tuesdays","latitude":42.260511,"longitude":-73.8096826,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon, Wed & Thurs.: 4:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nFriday: 4:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSaturday: 1:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSunday: 1:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nClosed Tuesdays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"r3LnBh","name":"Crossroads Brewing Company-Catskill Taproom","streetAddress":"201 Water Street","locality":"Catskill","region":"New York","postalCode":"12414","phone":"5184448277","latitude":42.2208002,"longitude":-73.8677725,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-10 21:38:28","updateDate":"2019-07-11 14:07:30","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-1:00pm-10:00pm,sun-1:00pm-8:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"71KSaB","name":"Blockhead","nameDisplay":"Blockhead","description":"Hop bomb with a light malt and a hidden alcoholic bite","abv":"9.4","styleId":33,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-10 11:59:40","updateDate":"2012-10-10 11:59:41","style":{"id":33,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial Red Ale","shortName":"Imperial Red","description":"Imperial Red Ales are deep amber to dark copper\/reddish brown.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and caf\u00e9s with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family \u2013 thus the name The 3 Brewers \u2013 \u201cthree\u201d for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare \u00e0 Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes \u2013 all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-24 14:45:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Ste-Catherine","streetAddress":"732 Ste-Catherine St. W.","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","phone":"514.788.6333","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.ca\/eng\/ste_catherine.php","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:30 -

It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now.

Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"N39Q0L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2004 Capitol Avenue","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95814","phone":"916-448-7032","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","latitude":38.573116,"longitude":-121.480958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1987","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-05-31 15:23:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"M2aXgP","name":"Blond Bimbo","nameDisplay":"Blond Bimbo","description":"Summer can\u2019t come to an end without at least one experience with the beach blond bimbo.
