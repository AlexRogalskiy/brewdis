Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"J7LzNx","name":"To \u00d8l","nameShortDisplay":"To \u00d8l","description":"In 2005, sat Tobias Emil Jensen and Tore Gynther at a party at their old high school with their teacher Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8 and spat into a flat sickly lager. The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).\r\n\r\nLater created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling\/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dvuEzd\/upload_YIRhuN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QCBEW7618T","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"10:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-10:00am-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wDsGTx","name":"Black Biscuit","nameDisplay":"Black Biscuit","description":"Barrel aged cross between an Old Ale and a Baltic Porter.

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.
