Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Silver City Brewery's handcrafted beers are available on draft, in 22oz bottles, 12oz bottle & 12oz can 6-packs across Washington State in bars, restaurants, and grocery stores.\r\n\r\nSilver City Brewery's production facility & brewery taproom is located at 206 Katy Penman Ave. in Bremerton, WA. Silver City Restaurant is located in Silverdale at 2799 NW Myhre Rd.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.","website":"http:\/\/silvercity.beer","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:44:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LCKMU86SX5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"XDsUGb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2799 NW Myhre Road","locality":"Silverdale","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98383","phone":"360-698-5879","website":"http:\/\/www.silvercitybrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":47.659282,"longitude":-122.687358,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2017-06-12 18:32:03","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IgNzA4","name":"Brewery & Taproom","streetAddress":"206 Katy Penman Ave","locality":"Bremerton","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98312","phone":"360-813-1487","website":"http:\/\/silvercity.beer","latitude":47.5615696,"longitude":-122.6780062,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-12 18:32:01","updateDate":"2018-06-19 19:52:35","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"t89YML","name":"Beauty Beauty","nameDisplay":"Beauty Beauty","abv":"4.5","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t89YML\/upload_1L7u0B-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t89YML\/upload_1L7u0B-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t89YML\/upload_1L7u0B-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t89YML\/upload_1L7u0B-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t89YML\/upload_1L7u0B-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t89YML\/upload_1L7u0B-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:18:56","updateDate":"2015-12-17 07:22:39","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Our Brew masters have extensively traveled Germany and the Czech Republic and have visited many breweries to learn the art of old world style brewing.","website":"http:\/\/luminawine.com\/our-brewery\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zkjGKM\/upload_71WfH2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jrzfqS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"311 Judges Road","extendedAddress":"Unit 8A","locality":"Wilmington","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28405","phone":"910-793-5299","website":"http:\/\/luminawine.com\/our-brewery\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday-Saturday: 11:00AM-6:00PM\r\nClosed on Sunday & Monday","latitude":34.253835,"longitude":-77.856525,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","yearClosed":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tuesday-Saturday: 11:00AM-6:00PM\r\nClosed on Sunday & Monday","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bcSdge","name":"Beaver Buzz","nameDisplay":"Beaver Buzz","description":"Coffee milk stout.","abv":"5.3","styleId":20,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-14 20:13:27","updateDate":"2016-10-14 20:13:28","style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

Low in carbon dioxide, these hazy beers are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Cloudiness is acceptable. These beers are quite dry and light bodied. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambicstyle\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet. Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8.1","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:34"},"breweries":[{"id":"NhT0t2","name":"Crazy Mountain Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Crazy Mountain","description":"Here at Crazy Mountain, we believe that when your passion is your job, life is good.

In 2010, he established the Vail Valley\u2019s first production brewery, with headquarters and a kickin\u2019 Taproom in Edwards. In 2015, Crazy Mountain expanded its reach to Denver, which became our production headquarters and Taproom. With a prime location in downtown\u2019s Baker Neighborhood, we offer a beautifully-remodeled tap room with 24 beers on draft and sports on TV, a clandestine speakeasy available for private buyouts, and (of course) a view of the ever-present snow-capped mountains in the near distance.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous mountain lifestyle carries over into everything we do \u2014 because our beer pairs best with adrenaline. Crazy Mountain brews craft beer with only the finest of ingredients, yielding the best tasting, crowd-pleasing ales and lagers.\r\n\r\nEach of our six-pack carriers features a character who\u2019s a particular breed of Crazy with a story to tell.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world.
