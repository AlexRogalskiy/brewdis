The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds.

English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels.

Black to very deep ruby\/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

This full-bodied, smooth straw colored lager has little to no hop aroma. The balance of Hallertau hops and a slight malty-sweet finish will leave you wanting another! Our Export Hell, like all of our beers, is naturally carbonated. This beer can be enjoyed for it's subtle complexities, or mindlessly consumed during great conversation with old and new friends.","abv":"5.6","availableId":5,"styleId":130,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qw2qPr\/upload_7YPuyH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qw2qPr\/upload_7YPuyH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qw2qPr\/upload_7YPuyH-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qw2qPr\/upload_7YPuyH-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qw2qPr\/upload_7YPuyH-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qw2qPr\/upload_7YPuyH-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pizza, Kielbasa and Sauerkraut, Wings, Spicy foods like Thai and Mexican, Italian, and of course: German!","createDate":"2014-10-15 19:05:17","updateDate":"2015-12-17 17:53:11","available":{"id":5,"name":"Spring","description":"Available during the spring months."},"style":{"id":130,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Experimental Beer (Lager or Ale)","shortName":"Experimental Beer","description":"An experimental beer is any beer (lager, ale or other) that is primarily grain-based and employs unusual techniques and\/or ingredients.

Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"UgR74t","name":"Stillwater Artisanal Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Stillwater Artisanal Ales","description":"\"A sincere artist is not one who makes a faithful attempt to put on to canvas what is in front of him, but one who tries to create something which is, in itself, a living thing.\" -Sir William Dobell\r\n\r\nThe goal of Stillwater Artisanal is just that, living art. Although packaged within a medium often overlooked for its artistic merits, our desire is to offer something new and intriguing. We present more than just a fine crafted beverage, rather an occasion that evokes an emotion and inspires contemplation. For art is not a sum of actions but rather an approach to life. We draw our inspiration from the world around us, whether that be a season, location, or even humanity itself. Our intent is to encapsulate this muse exhibiting an artistic rendition to the best of our abilities.","website":"http:\/\/www.stillwaterales.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AfUn8b","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","website":"http:\/\/www.stillwaterales.com\/","latitude":39.290585,"longitude":-76.609264,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
