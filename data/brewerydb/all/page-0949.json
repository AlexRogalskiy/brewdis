You know, back when you would get excited when your bottle shop would get in some world-class beers from Belgium. Nothing too fancy, just a beer that has been dialed in over the last hundred and fifty years or so, essentially making it impossible for us to make something better in our lifetime. Our humble attempt at doing justice to the style is Lilith, a Belgian Golden Ale that is as simple in concept as it is complex in flavor. Aromas are primarily yeast-driven with bright notes of citrus peel, fresh cut grass, flower gardens, and a spicy finish with white pepper, coriander, and tea leaf. Start to finish, this strong Golden Ale is a showcase of restraint and admiration, letting the classic ingredients shine and doing our best to stay out of their way. Prickly carbonation rips the subtle bready and doughy flavors off your taste buds and mixes them around with a balanced hop bitterness and grassy floral notes that tie everything together. We highly suggest coming in and grabbing a glass of Lilith Belgian Golden Ale and savoring all of its subtleties, then come back in 150 years and try it again and see if we accomplished our goal of making a beer worthy of our idols in Belgium","abv":"8","styleId":61,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-11-10 14:14:47","updateDate":"2017-11-10 14:14:47","style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
