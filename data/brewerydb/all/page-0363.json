Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"9TY2Xv","name":"Bullfrog Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Bullfrog","description":"The Bullfrog Brewery, located in downtown Williamsport, Pa, is an award-winning microbrewery \/ restaurant and has quickly grown into one of the largest attractions in Northcentral Pennsylvania.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts.

The body is expected to thin slightly, and the smoke aroma\/flavor will develop into an umami meatiness, like the rounded flavor of top notch charcuterie.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"wm5dNi","name":"Salmon River Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Salmon River","website":"http:\/\/www.salmonriverbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:38:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JNL1VK2GOR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fxO4GX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"300 Colorado St","locality":"McCall","region":"Idaho","postalCode":"83638","phone":"208-634-4772","website":"http:\/\/www.salmonriverbrewery.com\/","latitude":44.9058916,"longitude":-116.0991461,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"s4oNxD","name":"Chunkin Pumpkin","nameDisplay":"Chunkin Pumpkin","description":"Our Serenity meets sweet and savory with this scrumptious seasonal beer.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"2Zp1Ge","name":"Church Street Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Church Street","description":"The Church Street Brewing Company is bringing lagers and ales from around the world to Chicagoland.
