Another avenue we\u2019d been keen to go down for a while was brewing with grapes alongside one of our favourite but hard to source hops, Nelson Sauvin. This felt like the perfect opportunity. We fermented this IPA with a Kolsch yeast strain \u2013 super clean and highly attenuative; then added 20L of white grape juice per barrel and double dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

The brewer must indicate the classic style on which the entry is based to allow for accurate judging. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during evaluation.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:30"}},{"id":"EcDDtB","name":"Paulding Light","nameDisplay":"Paulding Light","description":"Tangy cranberry & honey mead with the snap of lime juice on the finish.","abv":"8","availableId":4,"styleId":142,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-17 16:56:01","updateDate":"2015-04-28 13:42:56","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":142,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Sweet Mead","shortName":"Sweet Mead","description":"Similar in balance, body, finish and flavor intensity to a well-made dessert wine (such as Sauternes), with a pleasant mixture of honey character, residual sweetness, soft fruity esters, and clean alcohol.

One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"}},{"id":"7OFCvx","name":"Paulina Lake Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Paulina Lake Pilsner","description":"Paulina Lake Pilsner is a classic German-Style Pilsner.
