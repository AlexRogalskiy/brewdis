The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown.

We also know that there are times when a ten percent beer is just what you need to keep you warm at night; to that end we will celebrate the seasons, months, weeks, or whatever we feel needs celebration with specialty releases that will vary wildly in alcohol content and style.  No matter the style or strength all Benchmark Beer will set the standard for its kind.","website":"http:\/\/www.benchmarkbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/benchmarkbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=be93d88055bc677b5cc102ed4&id=6f5a3d55b2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nMaqhu\/upload_x7Cwii-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nMaqhu\/upload_x7Cwii-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nMaqhu\/upload_x7Cwii-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nMaqhu\/upload_x7Cwii-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nMaqhu\/upload_x7Cwii-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-31 02:42:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:26:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AMGIO2E6V8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Jtm60s","name":"Benchmark Brewing Company","streetAddress":"6190 Fairmount Ave","extendedAddress":"Suite G","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92120","website":"http:\/\/www.benchmarkbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thurs: 3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri & Sat: noon - 8:00 pm\r\nSun: noon - 6pm","latitude":32.7872724,"longitude":-117.1020221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-31 11:52:30","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:29:42","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thurs: 3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri & Sat: noon - 8:00 pm\r\nSun: noon - 6pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AZkdmh","name":"Feldschl\u00f6\u00dfchen Di\u00e4t-Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Feldschl\u00f6\u00dfchen Di\u00e4t-Pilsner","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:20:17","updateDate":"2017-09-06 15:50:25","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Amazingly smooth 100 IBUs of piney, earth, and citrusy hops and high octane 10% ABV. \r\n\r\nFelony IPA is an English \/ American Hybrid double IPA that features more European hops than American. Brewed in an English style to maintain a malt backbone and coming in at 10% ABV, 100 IBU\u2019s and using 10 hop varieties to give it that American attitude Unlike those traditional IPA\u2019s that hit you in the face with citrus, we prefer to sneak up on you with an amazingly smooth 100 IBUs of piney, earth, and citrusy hops and high octane 10% ABV. This translates into an experience that should be illegal.\r\n\r\nThis beer is one of the few beers in the world whose base malt is Low-Lox, an anti-oxidation malt that provides superior shelf-life and flavor stability which we believe is of utmost importance when making IPA\u2019s. Learn more about the Low-Lox malt that we use.\r\n\r\nWe decided that although we love our West Coast brethren, we wanted to make our double IPA a bit differently. Our anti-reinheitsgebot perspective made this \u2018illegal\u2019 in our books so we made it the first of our Prison series.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:33:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QUG9N370X2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lAcrbq","name":"Gadsden","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-5:00pm-9:00pm,thu-5:00pm-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"heKnGb","name":"Birmingham","streetAddress":"3201 1st Avenue North","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"(205) 407-8025","website":"https:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/birmingham","latitude":33.5221355,"longitude":-86.7882994,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-10-14 19:57:28","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-3:00pm-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jKVcv4","name":"Fenceline Farmhouse Ale","nameDisplay":"Fenceline Farmhouse Ale","description":"A Farmhouse Ale brewed with generous additions of floor-malted wheat for a soft, creamy mouthfeel and hazy straw color, as well as generous additions of Huell Melon hops for subtle notes of strawberry and melon.","abv":"5.5","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jKVcv4\/upload_N3fUqX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jKVcv4\/upload_N3fUqX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jKVcv4\/upload_N3fUqX-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jKVcv4\/upload_N3fUqX-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jKVcv4\/upload_N3fUqX-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jKVcv4\/upload_N3fUqX-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-24 13:14:51","updateDate":"2017-04-24 13:15:09","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"PzdeP6","name":"Blackberry Farm Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Blackberry Farm","description":"Tucked away on Blackberry Farm's 4200 acre estate in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, Blackberry Farm Brewery produces classic Old World - style beers - each one artisan-crafted and bottle-conditioned.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackberryfarmbrewery.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PzdeP6\/upload_AfQ5k2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PzdeP6\/upload_AfQ5k2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PzdeP6\/upload_AfQ5k2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PzdeP6\/upload_AfQ5k2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PzdeP6\/upload_AfQ5k2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-09 14:24:07","updateDate":"2019-06-18 19:58:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PBNO36RGC4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"t4bMvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1471 West Millers Cove Road","locality":"Walland","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37886","phone":"(865) 984-8166","website":"http:\/\/www.blackberryfarm.com\/","latitude":35.687809,"longitude":-83.86247,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-09 17:16:17","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yZhVrs","name":"Fenceline Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Fenceline Pale Ale","description":"Fenceline Pale Ale is an approachable American style pale ale with smooth and balanced hop bitterness and a firm, expressive citrus hop flavor and aroma.

I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer\u2019s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I\u2019m my own worst critic.  I\u2019m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn\u2019t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this research and planning, what\u2019s the plan?  Start small.\r\n\r\nJack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?\r\n\r\nThis little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I\u2019ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it\u2019s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.\r\n\r\nSo, stop in and give it a try!","website":"http:\/\/jackpinebrewery.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_jJQ5SC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_jJQ5SC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_jJQ5SC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_jJQ5SC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_jJQ5SC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-16 22:52:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:39:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"3WRMEZA4D0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"CPYUBy","name":"Jack Pine Brewery - Taproom","streetAddress":"15593 Edgewood Drive","locality":"Baxter","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"56425","phone":"(218) 270-8072","website":"http:\/\/jackpinebrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday 4-10pm\r\nTuesday 4-10pm\r\nWednesday 4-10pm\r\nThursday 2-10pm\r\nFriday 12-11pm\r\nSaturday 12-11pm\r\nSunday 12pm-8pm","latitude":46.3773092,"longitude":-94.2534376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-16 22:54:29","updateDate":"2018-05-23 19:21:23","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday 4-10pm\r\nTuesday 4-10pm\r\nWednesday 4-10pm\r\nThursday 2-10pm\r\nFriday 12-11pm\r\nSaturday 12-11pm\r\nSunday 12pm-8pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
