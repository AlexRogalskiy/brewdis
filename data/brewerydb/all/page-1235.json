Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.

Our Braggot uses American two row malt, a sprinkle of honey malt, and 1,200 lbs of raw, unfiltered, unpasteurized Texas wildflower honey sourced from Montgomery and Brazoria Counties; and of course whole cone American hops. This beer is named after a Texas Comanche War Chief: Po-Cha-Na-Quar-Hip.\r\nTasting notes: bright orange with a honey scented white head; robust wildflower honey flavor, followed by clean hop bitterness, finishing with strong alcohol warmth. This brew has quite a kick, thanks to the bees.","abv":"9.1","ibu":"54","availableId":2,"styleId":147,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2013,"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-06 19:30:20","updateDate":"2015-08-06 19:48:22","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":147,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Braggot","shortName":"Braggot","description":"A harmonious blend of mead and beer, with the distinctive characteristics of both.

This time we chose a hop that has been around for a long time, but for some reason has gone unused, nearly disappearing from the brewing world. It was bred around the same time period as the revolutionary Cascade hop, but never received any recognition for kick starting the American Craft Beer Revolution like Cascade has. For shame, this is a very tasty hop.
