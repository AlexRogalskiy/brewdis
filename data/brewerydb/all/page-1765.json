Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"RuupG0","name":"Heidelberger Brauerei","nameShortDisplay":"Heidelberger Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.heidelberger-brauerei.de\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NNfEaZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Bergheimerstra\u00dfe 89-93","locality":"Heidelberg","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","postalCode":"69115","latitude":49.40781,"longitude":8.683357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-13 11:11:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8l9u6V","name":"Wolf Hefeweizen Hell","nameDisplay":"Wolf Hefeweizen Hell","abv":"5.2","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 11:58:25","updateDate":"2012-08-19 15:43:59","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:36:40"},"breweries":[{"id":"gTLcBL","name":"Kauzen Br\u00e4u","nameShortDisplay":"Kauzen Br\u00e4u","website":"http:\/\/www.kauzen.de","established":"1809","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-07 19:54:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"GSkOGp","name":"Ochsenfurt","streetAddress":"Uffenheimer Str. 17","locality":"Ochsenfurt","postalCode":"97199","website":"http:\/\/www.kauzen.de\/","latitude":49.6595327,"longitude":10.0712067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-11 21:27:38","updateDate":"2017-08-28 16:14:44","timezoneId":"Europe\/Berlin","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PeAGJS","name":"Wolfe City Brew Howling","nameDisplay":"Wolfe City Brew Howling","glasswareId":5,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PeAGJS\/upload_XjWHps-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PeAGJS\/upload_XjWHps-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PeAGJS\/upload_XjWHps-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PeAGJS\/upload_XjWHps-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PeAGJS\/upload_XjWHps-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PeAGJS\/upload_XjWHps-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:32","updateDate":"2015-12-16 09:40:41","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

A combination that guarantees high quality. It is quality that is the basis of Zeunerts\u2019 business. The Bavarian art of brewing is without a doubt the finest in the world. As early as 1859, Christoffer August Zeunert introduced copper vats and open fermenting tubs in production and the tradition of ageing the beer to the perfect maturity and flavour. It goes without saying that we follow the German Beer Purity Laws.\r\n\r\n ONLY FIRST-CLASS RAW MATERIALS WILL DO HERE\r\n\r\nWe are extremely careful about raw materials. The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer. At least that was the opinion of Christoffer August Zeunert. Hops are the spice of beer. The little hop cones contain the hundreds of flavours that give beer its bitterness, flavour and aroma. All hop varieties are carefully selected to suit their particular type of brew.","website":"http:\/\/zeunerts.se\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-02 16:10:22","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"uPcCls","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Storgatan 99","locality":"Sollefte\u00e5","postalCode":"881 40","website":"http:\/\/zeunerts.se\/","latitude":63.165966,"longitude":17.2865428,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-26 14:33:51","updateDate":"2017-08-24 18:12:10","timezoneId":"Europe\/Stockholm","country":{"isoCode":"SE","name":"SWEDEN","displayName":"Sweden","isoThree":"SWE","numberCode":752,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eKrxSE","name":"Wolfhound","nameDisplay":"Wolfhound","description":"Warm herbal malt aromas and a rich mahogany color create an inviting backdrop for this Imperial Red fermented with a Dublin Ale yeast.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.

As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.  We also offer a large selection of canned and bottled beer, ciders and mead, along with wine and liquor.","website":"http:\/\/www.cloudsbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-06 13:38:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:37:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SBMZWF10QE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"c2Ifvu","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"126 N.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fz3g3i\/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:40:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M8ICS1LEDY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wbpj5b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3912 W McLean Ave","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60647","website":"http:\/\/www.pipeworksbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.9180876,"longitude":-87.7260612,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2017-06-16 17:16:46","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"s8c6bf","name":"Wolpertinger","nameDisplay":"Wolpertinger","abv":"7.3","ibu":"35","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/s8c6bf\/upload_DfudyI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/s8c6bf\/upload_DfudyI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/s8c6bf\/upload_DfudyI-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/s8c6bf\/upload_DfudyI-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/s8c6bf\/upload_DfudyI-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/s8c6bf\/upload_DfudyI-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-20 15:36:10","updateDate":"2015-12-16 23:59:22","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.
