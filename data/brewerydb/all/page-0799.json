At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"}},{"id":"KDhhPK","name":"Huell & Oats","nameDisplay":"Huell & Oats","description":"A double dry-hopped NEIPA made with three kinds of oats and Huell Melon hops.","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-26 15:29:31","updateDate":"2018-07-26 15:29:31","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},{"id":"xlWehK","name":"Huey","nameDisplay":"Huey","description":"Black IPA \/ Cascadian Dark Ale","abv":"7.1","glasswareId":13,"availableId":2,"styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"very_cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Very Cold - (0-4C\/32-39F)","createDate":"2018-06-26 17:41:39","updateDate":"2018-06-26 17:50:08","glass":{"id":13,"name":"Willi","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

After some experimentation he landed on using typical North West hops and leaving out the oats commonly used in that style. Those decisions leave us with a very juicy, well balanced beer with a lighter body than it's North East cousins. Huge Citrus gets a massive addition of Cascade and Mosaic late in the brew, and is then dry-hopped with copious amounts of Cascade and Mosaic hops while the yeast is still active, leaving a Huge Citrus aroma and flavour - notes of tropical fruit, stone fruit, orange, grapefruit & pomelo. We used Sacc Trois yeast to ferment this beer to really increase the juicyness, hazyness and to add a bit of funk.
