In accordance with the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law of 1516), bock beers must have a pre-fermentation malt sugar concentration of 16%, which converts over to at least 7% alcohol after fermentation. These strong beers were made popular in the early 1600s by monks in order to minimize their hunger during fasting periods. While most bocks are dark, Blonde Bock is golden-colored and malty with a rich, creamy head. The rich flavor is counterbalanced with just the right level of bitterness from the Hallertau aroma hops and create a very smooth profile.","abv":"7","ibu":"23","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":88,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:52","updateDate":"2015-12-15 20:57:18","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":88,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Traditional German-Style Bock","shortName":"Bock","description":"Traditional bocks are made with all malt and are strong, malty, medium- to full-bodied, bottom-fermented beers with moderate hop bitterness that should increase proportionately with the starting gravity.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

After working as a brewer in southern Germany, Greg returned to the US to open his brewery.\r\n\r\nRamstein beers are made with the same care and precision that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.\r\n\r\nGreg found a special brewer\u2019s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point.

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:04"},"breweries":[{"id":"ZaaAPU","name":"Dos Desperados Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Dos Desperados","description":"Dos Desperados Viven: We Will Live, We Will Enjoy Life","website":"http:\/\/dosdesperadosbrew.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZaaAPU\/upload_wTuSzf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZaaAPU\/upload_wTuSzf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZaaAPU\/upload_wTuSzf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZaaAPU\/upload_wTuSzf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZaaAPU\/upload_wTuSzf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:11:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:54:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7FUKWD6CN3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QLp4mV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1241 Linda Vista Dr","locality":"San Marcos","region":"California","postalCode":"92078","phone":"(760) 566-6209","website":"http:\/\/dosdesperadosbrew.com","latitude":33.1372538,"longitude":-117.1938782,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:11:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"H0H7Xk","name":"Blonde Lager","nameDisplay":"Blonde Lager","description":"Light-bodied European style lager with Hallertau and Czech Saaz hops.","abv":"4.9","ibu":"25","glasswareId":4,"srmId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H0H7Xk\/upload_YImooI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H0H7Xk\/upload_YImooI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H0H7Xk\/upload_YImooI-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H0H7Xk\/upload_YImooI-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H0H7Xk\/upload_YImooI-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/H0H7Xk\/upload_YImooI-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"very_cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Very Cold - (0-4C\/32-39F)","createDate":"2018-08-10 16:43:47","updateDate":"2018-08-14 18:44:26","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"},"breweries":[{"id":"9dYPcN","name":"Asbury Park Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Asbury Park","description":"The original Asbury Park Brewery, now open for tours and tastings!","website":"https:\/\/www.asburyparkbrewery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9dYPcN\/upload_HWMmjI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9dYPcN\/upload_HWMmjI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9dYPcN\/upload_HWMmjI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9dYPcN\/upload_HWMmjI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9dYPcN\/upload_HWMmjI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-02-20 22:24:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:50:26","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ER3N61GMT5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"fQhCNM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"810 Sewall Ave","locality":"Asbury park","region":"New Jersey","phone":"732-455-5571","latitude":40.219517,"longitude":-74.012955,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-02-20 22:24:12","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:27:47","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
