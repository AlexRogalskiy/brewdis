By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars.

Black to very deep ruby\/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"w2WxaR","name":"Back Road Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Back Road","description":"\"We put LaPorte on the beer Map\"\r\n\r\n\"Small brewery big beers\"","website":"http:\/\/www.backroadbrewery.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_ks9l46-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_ks9l46-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_ks9l46-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_ks9l46-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_ks9l46-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:09:40","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"C6JD304N9K","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NULflH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"310 Perry Street","locality":"LaPorte","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46350","phone":"1-219-362-7623","website":"http:\/\/www.backroadbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thurs - Fri: 4:00 to 6:00 PM\r\nSaturday 1:00 to 4:00 PM\r\nSunday 2:00 to 4:00 PM","latitude":41.6120972,"longitude":-86.7265462,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:43","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"4:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"4:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-6:00pm,fri-4:00pm-6:00pm,sat-1:00pm-4:00pm,sun-2:00pm-4:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thurs - Fri: 4:00 to 6:00 PM\r\nSaturday 1:00 to 4:00 PM\r\nSunday 2:00 to 4:00 PM","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Vk1ohg","name":"Christmas Ale","nameDisplay":"Christmas Ale (2011)","description":"Each year since 1975, Anchor Brewing creates a distinctive Christmas Ale, available from early November to mid-January.

Our tree for 2011 is the bristlecone pine. Found high atop California's White Mountains, bristlecones are among the oldest living things on the planet. Some date back nearly 5,000 years, to the dawn of the ancient art of brewing.\r\n\r\nEach year our Christmas Ale gets a unique label and a unique recipe. Although our recipes must remain a secret, many save a few bottles from year to year. Properly refrigerated, the beer remains intriguing and drinkable for years. Different nuances emerge as the flavor mellows slightly, much like the memories of great holiday seasons past.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
