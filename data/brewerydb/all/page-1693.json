Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.058","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ohy298","name":"Flat12 Bierwerks","nameShortDisplay":"Flat12 Bierwerks","description":"Flat12 Bierwerks is a production craft brewery based in downtown Indianapolis, USA.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"YtsvRr","name":"New Braunfels Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"New Braunfels","description":"Founded in early 2011 by the Meyer family, we're inspired to brew our locally hand-crafted beer by old-word German recipes.

The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).\r\n\r\nLater created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school. Here they continued to hand brew until in 2010 found that two beers were now ripe to make its first commercial brew.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y1yCgh","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Run","description":"Crooked Run Brewing is an award winning small brewery located in Sterling, Virginia, with an original nanobrewery located in Leesburg, Virginia","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y1yCgh\/upload_x6RS6F-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:20:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:22:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HPJZNL1S6Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"gssG96","name":"Brewery\/Bar","streetAddress":"205 Harrison Street","locality":"Leesburg","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20175","phone":"(571) 918-4446","website":"http:\/\/www.crookedrunbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.1127672,"longitude":-77.5625836,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 19:21:48","updateDate":"2017-04-04 17:53:04","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 1:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xpgL0V","name":"Crooked Run Brewing","streetAddress":"22455 Davis Dr, suite 120","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20164","phone":"571-375-2652","website":"crookedrunbrewing.com","latitude":38.9947623,"longitude":-77.4231583,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-03 20:00:27","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:29:05","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
