In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and caf\u00e9s with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family \u2013 thus the name The 3 Brewers \u2013 \u201cthree\u201d for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare \u00e0 Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes \u2013 all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-24 14:45:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Ste-Catherine","streetAddress":"732 Ste-Catherine St. W.","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","phone":"514.788.6333","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.ca\/eng\/ste_catherine.php","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:30 -

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.\r\n\r\nWe have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.","website":"http:\/\/www.goodpeoplebrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fib7Lb\/upload_VODxsX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:24:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"C7N3FGZSB0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"pj4HJk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"114 14th Street South","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35223","website":"http:\/\/www.goodpeoplebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Taproom Hours\r\nWednesday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nThursday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nFriday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nSaturday: 1pm - 4pm","latitude":33.50713,"longitude":-86.811894,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Taproom Hours\r\nWednesday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nThursday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nFriday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nSaturday: 1pm - 4pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OHTofx","name":"Brown","nameDisplay":"Brown","glasswareId":5,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OHTofx\/upload_DawpmO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OHTofx\/upload_DawpmO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OHTofx\/upload_DawpmO-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OHTofx\/upload_DawpmO-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OHTofx\/upload_DawpmO-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OHTofx\/upload_DawpmO-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:54","updateDate":"2015-12-16 09:10:31","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:56:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AK23DS9YUB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-11:00pm,sat-2:00pm-11:00pm,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FxOSCi","name":"Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Brown Ale","description":"A rich, nutty dark ale with subtle chocolate flavor\/aroma and mild hop bitterness.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"38","glasswareId":3,"availableId":4,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-05 19:35:59","updateDate":"2018-06-05 20:05:14","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"https:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:25:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TN7GC9UK6M","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2LDkVX","name":"Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Brown Ale","description":"Our Brown is simply put\u2026. amazing!

The body is medium to keep this beer very drinkable and the aroma is of cocoa, and caramel with a hint of sweetness.","abv":"7","availableId":1,"styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Smoked meats, Southern desserts","createDate":"2013-07-14 14:32:47","updateDate":"2013-07-16 10:40:53","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

Our beers are never filtered or pasteurized and are always full of character and flavor.  We brew styles from American and Belgian to anything in between.  We typically brew our beers with four ingredients: malt, hops, yeast and San Antonio water.   However we have been known to add things like coffee, fruit, spices, and anything else that might catch our fancy.\r\n\r\nAt The Granary we love beer as beer helps to enrich our lives.  We take our beer and food seriously and we hope to politely challenge people\u2019s perspective of how beer can be paired with food.  We believe that every meal that is served can be made better when paired with the right style of beer.

Distributed in three states, Brown's cans and draughts are among the most enjoyable and celebrated locally brewed and hand crafted ales and lagers around.","website":"http:\/\/brownsbrewing.com\/","established":"1993","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/brownsbrewing.com\/contact\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_GspkFX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_GspkFX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_GspkFX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_GspkFX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_GspkFX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:52:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RY9AQIWGE8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"wadu38","name":"Brown's Brewing Troy Taproom","streetAddress":"417 River Street","locality":"Troy","region":"New York","postalCode":"12180","phone":"518-273-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.brownsbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.735771,"longitude":-73.687704,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2017-06-08 14:40:46","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"15yLhj","name":"Brown's Brewing Walloomsac Taproom and Brewery","streetAddress":"50 Factory Hill Road","locality":"North Hoosick","region":"New York","postalCode":"12133","phone":"518-205-5049","website":"http:\/\/brownsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday: 3 pm - 9 pm\r\nThursday: 3 pm - 9 pm\r\nFriday: 3 pm - 9 pm\r\nSaturday: Noon - 9 pm\r\nSunday: Noon - 7 pm","latitude":42.9249168,"longitude":-73.3435809,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-07 14:05:33","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:06:10","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wednesday: 3 pm - 9 pm\r\nThursday: 3 pm - 9 pm\r\nFriday: 3 pm - 9 pm\r\nSaturday: Noon - 9 pm\r\nSunday: Noon - 7 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
