During this time, an ale known as K\u00f6ttbusser was outlawed because it contained oats, honey, and molasses. Over the centuries since its prohibition, K\u00f6ttbusser became a lost brewing style. At Grimm Brothers, we\u2019ve created an imperial version of this beer and named it Magic Mirror.   Magic Mirror is the antithesis ale to Snow Drop, brewed with more grains, honey and molasses and aged in oak, this beer is a malty big light colored ale.  It has just enough hops to balance the sweetness but leave a refreshing oak flavor on your tongue.","abv":"9.5","availableId":4,"styleId":130,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OwxwuV\/upload_yFSgc6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OwxwuV\/upload_yFSgc6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OwxwuV\/upload_yFSgc6-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OwxwuV\/upload_yFSgc6-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OwxwuV\/upload_yFSgc6-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/OwxwuV\/upload_yFSgc6-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-13 18:53:08","updateDate":"2015-12-17 05:04:05","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":130,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Experimental Beer (Lager or Ale)","shortName":"Experimental Beer","description":"An experimental beer is any beer (lager, ale or other) that is primarily grain-based and employs unusual techniques and\/or ingredients.
