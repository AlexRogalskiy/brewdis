The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, yet its relatively high starting gravity and alcohol content make it a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to deep golden. Because the beer has been filtered, yeast is not present. The beer will have no flavor of yeast and a cleaner, drier mouthfeel. The beer should be clear with no chill haze present. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"ye1aeG","name":"Brauhaus Pforzheim","nameShortDisplay":"Brauhaus Pforzheim","website":"http:\/\/www.brauhaus-pforzheim.de\/","established":"1889","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lsVvbw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"St.Georgen Steige 12","region":"Pforzheim","postalCode":"75175","latitude":48.886764,"longitude":8.706501,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-15 23:52:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"U5RS5w","name":"Brauhaus-Pils","nameDisplay":"Brauhaus-Pils","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:08:02","updateDate":"2017-09-06 15:28:00","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

We also sat our 'heartbeat' 4BBL kit next to Big Beaver to constantly push our Alpha's, experiments and minds!","website":"http:\/\/www.beavertownbrewery.co.uk","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7DzIdq\/upload_KtKith-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7DzIdq\/upload_KtKith-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7DzIdq\/upload_KtKith-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7DzIdq\/upload_KtKith-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7DzIdq\/upload_KtKith-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:50:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"uX0gEL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unit 17 & 18 Lockwood Industrial Park Mill Mead Road","locality":"Tottenham Hale","region":"London","postalCode":"N17 9QP","phone":"+44 (0) 2085259884","latitude":51.5907617,"longitude":-0.0571249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 18:39:22","updateDate":"2015-02-16 18:39:50","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oUULQT","name":"Bravo","nameDisplay":"Bravo","description":"As for Bravo, according to Head Brewer, Chris Wilson, the base of the beer comes from pale, wheat, and crystal malts and features some roasted barley while Pilgrim and Hallertauer make up the light hop profile.","abv":"6.5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":3,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:53","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"a57dkm","name":"Weyerbacher Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Weyerbacher","description":"Established in 1995, Weyerbacher Brewing Company, Inc. was founded in the historic city of Easton, Pennsylvania.
