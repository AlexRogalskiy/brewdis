Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

The brewery was Aurora, Colorado\u2019s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":4.1,"betaAcidMin":4.7,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":55.1,"humuleneMax":55.1,"caryophylleneMin":14.5,"caryophylleneMax":14.6,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":26,"myrceneMin":15.5,"myrceneMax":17.5,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":0.1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:31","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":113,"name":"Saaz (American)","description":"Some American growers also grow a version of the Czech Saazer hop, although American versions are usually considered to lack true noble hop character, with higher myrcene and total oil than true Saaz Saazer.

Spalt Select was reportedly chosen by Anheuser-Busch to replace Spalt Spalter and Tettnang Tettnanger hops in some of their recipes. Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

This yields to a subtle yet balanced malt character and finishes with a mild, yet present bitterness that lingers on the palate.\r\nOther Notes: \r\nThis beer is not a \"hop bomb\". It is intended to be a refreshing, halfway point between the malt of an English Pale, and the wild hopping of a west coast pale ale, or American IPA. There is hop present, there is a lingering bitterness, but this beer won't destroy your palate for weeks to come, and leave you unable to dream. Dry-hopping refers to the process of how the last hops are added to the beer, not to the form or type of hop itself. In a dry hopped beer the final hops are added to almost finished beer, and are never in contact with heat. This helps preserve aroma and taste of the hop.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"35","srmId":14,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-03 19:03:23","updateDate":"2016-05-03 19:03:23","srm":{"id":14,"name":"14","hex":"C35900"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
