We operate a 3 barrel brewhouse (industry speak for really small) on site. Brewing small batches means the beer will always be amazingly fresh and allows for the flexibility to mix it up a little with new recipes getting brewed on a regular basis. Because it will be brewed in such small batches, much of the beer will be available only for purchase in the Bike Dog tasting room \u2014 allowing customers to see the beer go from grain to glass and hobnob with the brewers and allowing the brewers to personally nurture the local craft beer community.","website":"http:\/\/www.bikedogbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iW1GUi\/upload_jnKYDR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-31 20:04:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:18:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"F1RD7VAI58","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"KdoYYr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2534 Industrial Boulevard","extendedAddress":"#110","locality":"West Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95691","phone":"(916) 432-3376","website":"http:\/\/www.bikedogbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 9:30 pm","latitude":38.566263,"longitude":-121.543518,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-01 03:30:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 9:30 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cBqXwG","name":"Triple Karmeliet","nameDisplay":"Triple Karmeliet","description":"Tripel Karmeliet is a very refined and complex golden-to-bronze brew with a fantastic creamy head.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"SsYPgS","name":"Trillium Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Trillium","description":"We are a family owned and operated brewery in the Fort Point Channel neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.

Often brewed with light colored Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers are well attenuated. The perception of hop bitterness is medium-low to medium -high, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:16"},"breweries":[{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Triple Voodoo Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Triple Voodoo","description":"Triple Voodoo Brewing is life to the extreme and at full volume.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.
