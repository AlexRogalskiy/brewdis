Jobs was well and midden side by side. It was, however, aware that it was dangerous to drink the water. The food was smoked and salted. They ate meat, fish and cabbage.\r\n\r\nWhen brewing, the grist is dissolved in hot water. They found out quickly that if you boiled water and added hops to the beer, so we got a drink, you were not sick and could stay.\r\n\r\nEvery Dane drank in the Middle Ages 6-8 liters of beer a day! A common rural households with 15 persons should be provided with 90-120 liters of beer every day! Scullery was more important than the kitchen, and most often, a rural household have a girl who did not do anything other than produce malt and beer.\r\n\r\nOn Monastic can now see the ruins of both kitchen and utility room. Scullery was greater than the kitchen! There was Monastic 4 breweries that were in use at the same time.\r\n\r\nKlosterbryg is brewed with lager malt, wheat malt and caramel malt. It is seasoned with three different types of hops, which matches maltene. This is a beer with 6% alcohol, which is in the style of India Pale Ale.\r\n\r\nThere is only applied aroma hops. English Fuggles and Styrian Goldings with German Perle. Fuggles and Goldings are the two most classic English aroma hops. They give the beer a slightly perfumed scent, reminiscent of clementines.\r\n\r\nAroma hops makes the beer very soft in taste. With a fairly large dosage you do not experience the harsh bitterness that hops else can provide.\r\n\r\nThis is a beer that is suitable for fish and light meat dishes. It is definitely also suitable to enjoy as it is.\r\n\r\nDrink it at cellar temperature, about 6 degrees Celsius, possibly. slightly warmer for the flavoring may come into its own.","abv":"6","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rao3Y\/upload_3rWCQM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rao3Y\/upload_3rWCQM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rao3Y\/upload_3rWCQM-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rao3Y\/upload_3rWCQM-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rao3Y\/upload_3rWCQM-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rao3Y\/upload_3rWCQM-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2012-12-15 15:08:48","updateDate":"2015-12-16 22:16:26","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.
