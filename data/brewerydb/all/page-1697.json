Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of October.","abv":"5","availableId":4,"styleId":68,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RAOZxJ\/upload_zMu4Nl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RAOZxJ\/upload_zMu4Nl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RAOZxJ\/upload_zMu4Nl-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RAOZxJ\/upload_zMu4Nl-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RAOZxJ\/upload_zMu4Nl-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RAOZxJ\/upload_zMu4Nl-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:27","updateDate":"2017-01-10 22:02:24","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":68,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","shortName":"Fruit Lambic","description":"These beers, also known by the names framboise, kriek, peche, cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit flavors and aromas.

Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"21","abvMin":"5.6","abvMax":"8.6","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"qFzOjy","name":"Brasserie Cantillon","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie Cantillon","description":"A traditional Lambic brewery from Brussels.","website":"http:\/\/www.cantillon.be\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qFzOjy\/upload_zQ9Hjo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qFzOjy\/upload_zQ9Hjo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qFzOjy\/upload_zQ9Hjo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qFzOjy\/upload_zQ9Hjo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qFzOjy\/upload_zQ9Hjo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"BvGY4L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Gheudestraat 56","locality":"Anderlecht","region":"Brussel","phone":"32-(0)2-521-49-28","website":"http:\/\/www.cantillon.be\/","latitude":50.8415188,"longitude":4.3355854,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NzYc16","name":"Vignette","nameDisplay":"Vignette","description":"Sour Blond Ale (w\/ Cherries)","abv":"4.5","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-05 15:17:56","updateDate":"2014-09-09 16:51:02","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.

The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/mailing-list","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SY2b6E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"525 East Madison Street","extendedAddress":"PO Box 776","locality":"Spring Green","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53588","phone":"608-588-3300","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","latitude":43.1754057,"longitude":-90.0616834,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2016-09-16 13:26:18","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UxKtAU","name":"Viking Blod","nameDisplay":"Viking Blod","description":"Nordic honey wine with hibiscus and hops added.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder.

All shall undergo long maturation times while many others will spend time resting on wood.","website":"http:\/\/oecbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_tnbC2R-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-06 16:28:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:55:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"YJIM4XBA78","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MJozk7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7 Fox Hollow Rd","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","phone":"(203) 295-2831","website":"http:\/\/oecbrewing.com","latitude":41.4684694,"longitude":-73.1200339,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-07 11:23:25","updateDate":"2014-08-07 11:23:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sat-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cwUcKw","name":"Villa Pils","nameDisplay":"Villa Pils","description":"Traditional German Style Pilsner - brewed with 100% German Malts and hopped exclusively with Sterling.","abv":"5","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-08 17:56:51","updateDate":"2018-06-12 19:22:03","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

Low in carbon dioxide, these hazy beers are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Cloudiness is acceptable. These beers are quite dry and light bodied. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambicstyle\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet. Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8.1","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:34"},"breweries":[{"id":"DWjwcm","name":"Rivertown Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Rivertown","description":"Welcome to the Rivertown Brewing Company, We specialize in brewing traditional Handcrafted Lagers and Ales, using only the finest and freshest ingredients available.  use the buttons to the left to find out \"What Ales You\"!","website":"http:\/\/rivertownbrewery.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/DWjwcm\/upload_Z5i1yf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:54:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DX8G13SKPL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eKF3uv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"607 Shepherd Drive #6","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45215","phone":"513-827-9280","website":"http:\/\/rivertownbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:        4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu:         5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\t5:00 pm -10:00 pm\r\nSat:\t2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":39.236015,"longitude":-84.462885,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:        4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu:         5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\t5:00 pm -10:00 pm\r\nSat:\t2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QLwtsU","name":"Ville De Cinq Saisons","nameDisplay":"Ville De Cinq Saisons","description":"This earthy farmhouse ale features mild hopping with Fuggles.","abv":"6.5","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-11-19 15:50:13","updateDate":"2018-11-19 15:50:13","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Some add it to the mash others add it to the boil and some even combine it directly to the cooled wort prior to fermentation.\r\nFor our regular Vin de Saison we added 20% Swartland Chenin blanc aquired from Mullineux Family wines. We opted for this grape variety as it\u2019s the most widely grown wine grape variety in South Africa and increasingly becoming a force to be reckoned with internationally.\r\nIn addition to our regular Vin de Saison, this year we mixed things up a bit by allowing one barrel to ferment naturally\/wild without the addition of our regular Saison yeast, rather relying on yeast present on the grapes and within the barrel.\r\nSo what does a wine beer hybrid taste like?\r\nWell it\u2019s fundamentally a beer with a super fresh aroma and a lovely crisp grape derived acidity.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
