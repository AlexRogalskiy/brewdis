Funded by the backers of the Cincinnati and Covington Street Railway Company, you could take a streetcar from Fountain Square to the Lagoon entrance in 25 minutes. There was something for everyone: a large lake and boathouse for beach goers, a dance hall and amphitheater for artsy types, a midway with carnival games and food for the masses, and popular rides like the roller coaster Scenic Railway for thrill seekers. Actors, musicians and circus performers from around the world entertained as many as 40,000 people a week.

The British found that in sending beer to their troops stationed in India they needed to add more hops to act as a preservative. In doing so the added bitterness created a newly sought after flavor profile inevitably leading to the birth of the Imperial IPA. Laila\u2019s Midnight takes the experiment a step further by adding a dash of nutty Midnight malt and a few other inspired hints of roasted malt flavor to produce a well-balanced and mystically vibrant dark IPA.","abv":"9.5","glasswareId":5,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 17:05:47","updateDate":"2015-01-21 18:59:06","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze.
