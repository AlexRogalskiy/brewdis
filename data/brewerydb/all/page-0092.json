The brewery was Aurora, Colorado\u2019s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"},"breweries":[{"id":"sXgFVK","name":"De Garde Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"De Garde","description":"We are a small rural brewery specializing in many diverse styles of ales, but with a focus on spontaneous fermentations inspired by the European farmhouse traditions.","website":"http:\/\/degardebrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-12 22:49:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:27:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"BYV8OXPA5I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1tpoam","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6000 Blimp Blvd","extendedAddress":"Unit A","locality":"Tillamook","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97141","phone":"(503) 815-1635","website":"http:\/\/degardebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSun:  11:00am - 5:00pm","latitude":45.4207631,"longitude":-123.7999426,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-12 22:49:50","updateDate":"2017-08-22 16:14:42","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSun:  11:00am - 5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mkKDw2","name":"Apricot Cardamom","nameDisplay":"Apricot Cardamom","description":"Honey, Apricot, Cardamom","abv":"6","styleId":145,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 21:52:21","updateDate":"2018-05-15 19:29:51","style":{"id":145,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Fruit Melomel","shortName":"Fruit Melomel","description":"In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead.

This land has been in our family since the 1920\u2019s when our grandfather planted his first trees in Tieton, Washington. We take our stewardship of the land seriously and have been farming organically for the last 25 years.\r\n\r\nAs a third generation Yakima Valley farmer with a degree in horticulture from Washington State University and over thirty five years\u2019 experience in marketing produce, Craig has always been curious about the back-story: the history, production, science, and industry of food. Growing different varieties of trees is truly what makes Craig happy and he is always looking for new varieties to plant and nurture.  In 2008 he was introduced to cider apple varieties, those gnarly, inedible wild apple varieties needed to make great cider.  He planted twenty five varieties in a test block of two acres to study the growing patterns: did each fit into the existing bloom and harvest schedule of the farm, what were the flavor profiles of the fruit and how did that variety add to the cider that we wanted to make.\r\n\r\nFrom that original twenty five, Craig has narrowed it down to the eight most suitable for commercial production, never closing the door on annual experimentation when he learns of a new variety. We now have the largest acreage of cider apples and Perry pears in the state of Washington with 55 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Yakima Valley is the largest apple producing region in Washington and there is an infrastructure existing in our valley that provides many advantages when you are making cider.  Whether we are storing our apples in controlled atmosphere, sending our apricots and cherries to be processed, or selecting the complementary hops and pumpkin for our seasonal ciders \u2013 it all exists in the valley we call home.\r\n\r\nA love of land, food and drink has inspired us to make cider with the fruit we are growing at our ranch, Harmony Orchards.  We know the ciders we make are an expression of the harvest and reflective of the fruit and the place that it is grown.","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","established":"1920","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LrQuwi\/upload_yQid7C-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 20:31:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9ASIXD","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"619 West J Street","locality":"Yakima","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98902","phone":"509-571-1430","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","latitude":46.6158588,"longitude":-120.5217865,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","updateDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QRz9pH","name":"Apricot Cider","nameDisplay":"Apricot Cider","description":"OS apricot features the natural taste and aroma of fresh apricots balanced with acidity and tartness.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"22","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"shephard's pie\r\nlamb curry","createDate":"2014-11-14 19:47:00","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:34:34","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"2bisas","name":"Bone Hook Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Bone Hook","description":"We offer 20 freshly brewed beers on tap and a wine selection.
