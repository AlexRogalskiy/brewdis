Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"},"breweries":[{"id":"CmDhK5","name":"Sch\u00f6nbuch Br\u00e4u","nameShortDisplay":"Sch\u00f6nbuch Br\u00e4u","website":"http:\/\/www.braumanufaktur.com\/","established":"1823","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CmDhK5\/upload_DkxhVP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CmDhK5\/upload_DkxhVP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CmDhK5\/upload_DkxhVP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CmDhK5\/upload_DkxhVP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CmDhK5\/upload_DkxhVP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"bpBKo9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Postplatz 6","region":"B\u00f6blingen","postalCode":"71032","phone":"07031\/2173-0","website":"http:\/\/www.schoenbuchbraeu.de\/","latitude":48.6802429,"longitude":9.055195,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 15:06:21","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"5TRopl","name":"Brauhaus B\u00f6blingen","streetAddress":"Lange Strasse 20","locality":"B\u00f6blingen","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","postalCode":"71032","phone":"+497031681323","website":"http:\/\/www.brauhaus-bb.de\/","hoursOfOperation":"Brauhaus:\r\nDaily 11.00 -

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
