The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5R2O1T6ZQL","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5R4Akp","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1837 North Avenue","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53083","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.773281,"longitude":-87.730762,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2017-04-20 18:09:30","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-10:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm,wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-11:00am-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gSdZta","name":"Enkel Biter","nameDisplay":"Enkel Biter","styleId":3,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:10","updateDate":"2015-06-05 16:34:46","style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.

He started home brewing in 1994 after a year abroad studying Linguistics at The Braunschweig Technical University in Germany.  He actually caught the bug 5 years earlier on one of his high school exchange trips to Clauthal-Zellerfeld in Germany.  While on an excursion with the group to London, the father of the family he was staying with served him his homebrewed John Bull.  He would never forget it, but would wait to brew his own until the legal age of 21.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from the University of Oklahoma with degrees in International Business, German and Management Information Systems, he started a 16 year career in the Information Technology business that was very successful.  Many lasting relationships were formed during this time.  Many of his biggest supporters come from this IT family as well as his extended Soccer family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000 he and his wife moved to Tulsa into a home in the Renaissance neighborhood.  They quickly fell in love with its charm, character, neighbors, surrounding shops, accessibility and walkability.  He served as the neighborhood president for 4 years from 2006 through 2010 and ever since as Treasurer on the board.  There are so many things that they liked about living in this part of Midtown Tulsa that when they had kids they renovated their house versus moving to another part of town.\r\n\r\nGlenn continued to dream of becoming a professional brewer someday and was always looking to further his education in the brewing field.  In 2008 while taking a tour of a brewery in Hood River, Oregon he decided to start taking the necessary steps to make this dream a reality.  He began to read anything and everything beer related and of course brewed and brewed.  In October of 2011 the Hall\u2019s founded the Renaissance Brewing Company and purchased a dilapidated commercial property in their neighborhood at 12th and Lewis where they wanted to build the brewery building.  Tulsa\u2019s antiquated zoning laws, however, only allowed breweries in Industrial areas so they had to apply for a zoning variance.  Although this was a delay of over a year, Glenn never lost track of his vision.\r\n\r\nHe completed the Concise Course in Brewing Technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago, Ill. as well as the esteemed International Diploma Program from the World Brewing Academy which is a partnership between the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago and the Doemens Institute in Munich, Germany.  Glenn also successfully completed the Colorado Boy Brewery and Pub Immersion Course with the famous Tom Hennessy in Ridgway Colorado.  Tom will always be his mentor as well as all the other breweries that have helped along the way.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long journey and a long road still to tread, so Prost!","website":"http:\/\/www.renaissancebeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P07215MSRB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"orNo5d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1147 S Lewis Ave.","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74104","website":"www.renaissancebeer.com","latitude":36.1462265,"longitude":-95.9580406,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:52","updateDate":"2018-01-15 21:29:50","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"L0wGl4","name":"Ennert Dunkles","nameDisplay":"Ennert Dunkles","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:16:44","updateDate":"2018-11-06 19:08:41","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
