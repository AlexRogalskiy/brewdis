This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},{"id":"Xxtf7y","name":"Red Brick Ale","nameDisplay":"Red Brick Ale","description":"A robust, red ale deriving its hue and rich, roasted caramel character from ample additions of Crystal malts which are balanced by copious Cascade hopping.","abv":"5.42","ibu":"36","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xxtf7y\/upload_PJwMOU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xxtf7y\/upload_PJwMOU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xxtf7y\/upload_PJwMOU-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xxtf7y\/upload_PJwMOU-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xxtf7y\/upload_PJwMOU-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Xxtf7y\/upload_PJwMOU-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.053","createDate":"2012-10-21 16:40:55","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:34:55","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

A combination of stewed crystal malts and roasted barley gives Red Cap its distinctive garnet color and light tan head. The aroma is malty sweet with a light hint of Northwest hops. The flavor is primarily toffee-like malt with a crisp hop balance and slightly dry finish from the roasted barley. Red Cap is a versatile beer that pairs well with a variety of foods. The caramel flavors from crystal malt would nicely complement a well-seared steak or burger or even blackened salmon. The smooth, crisp finish make it a natural with pizza. The malty sweetness can ease fiery Mexican or Asian dishes. Try Red Cap with sharp cheeses, fruits and nuts. Irish Red Ales originated in the town of Kilkenny in 1710 as an offshoot of the English Pale Ales of the day. The addition of roasted barley gave the beer a darker color and drier finish than its English counterparts. The style never caught on much in Ireland, being overshadowed by Stouts, and Lagers, but became popular in the U.S. thanks to marketing by major macro-breweries.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"25","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.055","createDate":"2015-07-29 15:06:09","updateDate":"2015-07-29 15:06:09","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
