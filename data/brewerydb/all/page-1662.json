He\u2019brew now sells across 35 states, through 40 wholesalers and nearly 5,000 retailers. \r\n\r\nAfter 17 years of being an outspoken cheerleader for contract brewing, Shmaltz recently broke with tradition and opened its own New York State production brewery in Clifton Park, NY, 10 minutes north of Albany\u2019s capital district. Shmaltz\u2019s new home boasts a 50-barrel brewhouse with 30,000 barrels of annual capacity. The new brewery packages 12 and 22 ounce bottles and kegs of their diverse core and seasonal favorites, and hosts fans and beer tourists in their new tasting room for tours, barrel-aged previews, and special releases.","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltzbrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:04:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"I89R4JZXWU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"jivaao","name":"San Francisco","streetAddress":"912 Cole St.","extendedAddress":"#338","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94117","phone":"818-825-8765","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltz.com\/","latitude":37.7654594,"longitude":-122.4497845,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-02 17:11:22","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"FwJ3bJ","name":"Clifton Park","streetAddress":"6 Fairchild Square","locality":"Clifton Park","region":"New York","postalCode":"12065","phone":"518-406-5430","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltzbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.9014992,"longitude":-73.7928352,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 11:23:55","updateDate":"2017-08-31 18:53:41","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xy2NyO","name":"Brooklyn","streetAddress":"3008 W 12th St","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11224","phone":"(415) 298-1507","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltz.com\/","latitude":40.5753162,"longitude":-73.9796725,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","yearClosed":"2012","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2013-11-21 17:09:30","updateDate":"2017-08-31 18:53:41","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VTzBgR","name":"Tunnel of Love Watermelon Wheat","nameDisplay":"Tunnel of Love Watermelon Wheat","availableId":6,"styleId":114,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VTzBgR\/upload_QfIBKn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VTzBgR\/upload_QfIBKn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VTzBgR\/upload_QfIBKn-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VTzBgR\/upload_QfIBKn-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VTzBgR\/upload_QfIBKn-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/VTzBgR\/upload_QfIBKn-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-14 15:38:35","updateDate":"2015-12-18 04:50:13","available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":114,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Wheat Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Fruit Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made\u2014one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Ale was the result.  \r\n\r\nIn 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013. Stop on by for a flight or a glass, hang out to enjoy our seasonal selections, and stay a while for a little South Dakota hospitality. \r\n\r\nJoin us in the Black Hills and discover your own pint of gold.","website":"http:\/\/www.minerbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nnJJi8\/upload_Lj5CZ6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:29:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P89USNBFD7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"2EpPvi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23845 Hwy 385","locality":"Hill City","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57745","phone":"(605) 574-2886","website":"http:\/\/www.minerbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"11 a.m. - 8 p.m. daily","latitude":43.948569,"longitude":-103.522307,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:42:49","updateDate":"2015-06-11 20:35:40","hoursOfOperationNotes":"11 a.m. - 8 p.m. daily","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"tHii3J","name":"Prairie Berry Eastbank","streetAddress":"322 East 8th Street","locality":"Sioux Falls","region":"SD","postalCode":"57103","phone":"605-496-7175","website":"http:\/\/www.prairieberry.com\/eastbank\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon.-Sat., 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sun., 11 a.m.-4 p.m.","latitude":43.5486429,"longitude":-96.7238975,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-11-17 21:32:03","updateDate":"2014-12-15 11:46:27","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon.-Sat., 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sun., 11 a.m.-4 p.m.","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jgSnlQ","name":"Turn For The Wurst","nameDisplay":"Turn For The Wurst","description":"Oktoberfest brewed with smoked malts, fennel seed, and other herbs and spices.","abv":"5.8","styleId":102,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-10 19:07:38","updateDate":"2016-09-10 19:07:38","style":{"id":102,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style M\u00e4rzen \/ Oktoberfest","shortName":"American Oktoberfest","description":"The American style of these classic German beers is distinguished by a comparatively greater degree of hop character.
