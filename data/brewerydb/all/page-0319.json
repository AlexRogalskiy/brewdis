If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

While the majority of our beers are only available on draft, we bottle several of our flagship brews as well as our recent, highly-acclaimed Barrel Aged Series.\r\n\r\nOur Tasting Room is the largest and most accessible in the state, with a spacious and sunny Beer Garden. You can visit our gift shop, \u201cThe Brewtique,\u201d and take our interactive, self-guided tour. While many production breweries are only open a few hours per week, we are open daily for tours and tastings.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d love for you to stop by!\r\n\r\n\u2013 Ryan Krill, Chris \u201cHank\u201d Henke, Bob Krill and the CMBC Brew Crew","website":"http:\/\/www.capemaybrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OYtwtU\/upload_0X1ntT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OYtwtU\/upload_0X1ntT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OYtwtU\/upload_0X1ntT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OYtwtU\/upload_0X1ntT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OYtwtU\/upload_0X1ntT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:00:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IJ8TRUQAPF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"PMHd1p","name":"Tasting Room","streetAddress":"1288 Hornet Road","locality":"Cape May","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08204","phone":"6098499933","website":"http:\/\/www.capemaybrewery.com\/","latitude":39.0030559,"longitude":-74.9129316,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2016-09-30 17:32:10","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
