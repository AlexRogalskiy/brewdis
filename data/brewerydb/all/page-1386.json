Its silky velvet-like body aides in draping the coconut from the front to the back of your tongue, only thinning out as the salt hits the palate, inducing just the slightest amount of salivation, helping this creamy coconut bomb wash clean and keeping it incredibly drinkable for a stout that is darker than the Alaskan sky in winter.

A Gose is a top fermented beer style from the German city of Leipzig, which uses at least 50% wheat in the grist, they are by definition tart, herbal and refreshing but what really characterises them is a defined saltiness which traditonally would have come from the particular water in the area they were brewed.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re not stupid enough to completely take on 100?s of years of German brewing tradition and regional knowledge so we\u2019ve made a few changes to the method we will use in the production of the beer, all of which should give us the best chance of making the beer representative of the style.\r\n\r\nIn true collaborative spirit Anders felt we should also bring an Anglo-Danish element to the beer; we agreed and so we\u2019ll be adding Gooseberries for some English fruit and tartness typical of the style. The Danish ingredients will be additions of Sea Buckthorn and Rosehips.","abv":"4.1","styleId":165,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fwqQRz\/upload_yZwo7X-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fwqQRz\/upload_yZwo7X-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fwqQRz\/upload_yZwo7X-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fwqQRz\/upload_yZwo7X-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fwqQRz\/upload_yZwo7X-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fwqQRz\/upload_yZwo7X-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-01 14:52:21","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:35:44","style":{"id":165,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Contemporary Gose","shortName":"Contemporary Gose","description":"Contemporary Goses are straw to medium amber, or, may take on the hue of added fruits or other ingredients if present.
