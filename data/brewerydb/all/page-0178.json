Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"O0n0Qn","name":"Swashbuckler Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Swashbuckler","description":"Founded by Scott Bowser, Swashbuckler Brewing Company became the first brewery ever to be located on the grounds of a Renaissance Faire in the year 2000.

After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:15:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MPZR37EQWD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7wnMm8","name":"Bernard Bohemian Ale","nameDisplay":"Bernard Bohemian Ale","description":"Top fermented special beer with fine yeast\r\n\r\nSpice up your day with top fermented special beer Bernard Bohemian Ale.

When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OdysseyBeerwerks\/app_100265896690345","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:24:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:41:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KFRB2G1TQ7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"I4hZZy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5535 W 56th Ave,","extendedAddress":"Suite 107","locality":"Arvada","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80002","phone":"(303) 421-0772","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","latitude":39.8007911,"longitude":-105.0589359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:42:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4LHVCv","name":"Berry Ale","nameDisplay":"Berry Ale","abv":"5.4","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4LHVCv\/upload_8ociGj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4LHVCv\/upload_8ociGj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4LHVCv\/upload_8ociGj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4LHVCv\/upload_8ociGj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4LHVCv\/upload_8ociGj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4LHVCv\/upload_8ociGj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-03 15:55:29","updateDate":"2015-12-17 16:35:06","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"2QH9GI","name":"Carrollwood Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Carrollwood","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2QH9GI\/upload_X4YHVO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-30 12:55:49","updateDate":"2019-07-18 19:08:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8DVUB4TM2H","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"fYZSaX","name":"The Brass Tap","streetAddress":"10047 N.

About six months had passed and Mark found himself wandering the isles of a local homebrew shop and decided to take another go at making beer at home. He spent hundreds of hours over a period of seven years perfecting his recipes. He was obsessed with learning new brewing techniques and the beers became remarkable. In 2012, James approached Mark again with a new idea to open a brewery in Sacramento's burgeoning craft beer market. Big Sexy Brewing was no longer a cool idea it was a reality. The team started by collecting equipment and pooling together the cash to start the new venture. It took three years for the new co-founders to find a perfect location for the new brewery. They settled on a cool little-forgotten warehouse district tucked away in South East Sacramento. James with a background in business operations and marketing and Mark with his craft beer background realized quickly that they were going to need help. In 2015, they recruited Ryan Moore the Vice President of a local commercial bank as a partner and Chief Financial Officer and to round off the team in 2016, the Reilly Family (Pat & Sarah) joined as the companies financial partners.

And soon realized that they shared the same entrepreneurial values and, of course, the love of making wholesome and delicious food and drink.\r\n \r\nThe idea of making kombucha that is low in calories, delicious, and slightly alcoholic had been brewing in Barry's mind for a while.  John Hillgen, one of Barry's students at Yale School of Management, a doctor and a co-owner of several wine stores, fell in love with this concept and suggested that they start a business together.\r\n \r\nWhen Barry and John were ready to start an alcoholic kombucha business, they asked Ariel to join.  Kombrewcha was born.","website":"http:\/\/www.kombrewcha.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/455lP5\/upload_bBSj6G-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/455lP5\/upload_bBSj6G-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/455lP5\/upload_bBSj6G-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/455lP5\/upload_bBSj6G-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/455lP5\/upload_bBSj6G-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-10 15:04:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0QwiXH","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","website":"http:\/\/www.kombrewcha.com\/","latitude":40.6781784,"longitude":-73.9441579,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-10 18:10:42","updateDate":"2015-03-10 18:10:42","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lYwOqW","name":"Berry Horny","nameDisplay":"Berry Horny","description":"This refreshing summer ale has a crisp bright beginning balanced by a sweet malty character.

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor from yeast can be typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clovelike characteristics should not be perceived. Body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Brewer may indicate on the bottle whether the yeast should be intentionally roused or if they prefer that the entry be poured as quietly as possible.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:43:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"nB97NK","name":"Horny Goat Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Horny Goat","description":"We\u2019re often questioned about the origin of our name.

As kids they passed by the Astro Drive-in Movie Theatre and Polar Bear Ice Cream shop while riding their bikes to and from their Grandfather\u2019s church. Eventually they left home for school. Years passed by and when they returned, their old stomping grounds were almost unrecognizable. Older community spots were shutting down, as new development projects reshaped the places they once knew. A new interest in Oak Cliff, especially the Bishop Arts District, brought more and more people across the Trinity River. During this transformation, they watched as the Craft Beer Movement rippled through Dallas-Fort Worth. As the revitalization of Oak Cliff and the beer-making revolution caught traction, the heart of Oak Cliff was lacking unique craft beer destinations to call home. The founders embraced the opportunity to change that\u2013and there was no hesitation on what to name it: Oak Cliff Brewing Company.","website":"https:\/\/www.oakcliffbrewing.co","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pUjpSu\/upload_cLCGyz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pUjpSu\/upload_cLCGyz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pUjpSu\/upload_cLCGyz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pUjpSu\/upload_cLCGyz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pUjpSu\/upload_cLCGyz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-26 13:05:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:32:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EDWIJ7COT1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IeEacB","name":"Oak Cliff Brewing Co","streetAddress":"1300 S Polk St #222","locality":"Dallas","region":"Texas","postalCode":"75224","website":"https:\/\/www.oakcliffbrewing.co","latitude":32.7326602,"longitude":-96.8388687,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-26 13:07:15","updateDate":"2018-10-26 13:07:15","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
