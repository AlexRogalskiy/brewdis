Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character.

So go ahead, have a Bayern Amber and taste Bayern\u2019s legacy, which has become a bit of living Montana history.","abv":"5.4","ibu":"23","availableId":1,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jRh8X6\/upload_3ctxjS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jRh8X6\/upload_3ctxjS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jRh8X6\/upload_3ctxjS-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jRh8X6\/upload_3ctxjS-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jRh8X6\/upload_3ctxjS-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/jRh8X6\/upload_3ctxjS-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 18:12:26","updateDate":"2015-12-18 00:37:34","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.

By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 160,000 barrels of beer and 10,000 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality.

Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District.

Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

The property has quickly proven to be a great family friendly place to kick back, relax, spend time with family & friends & listen to live music.  \r\n\r\nPerry County's Oldest Brewery expanded into Cumberland County in March of 2019.  Be sure to visit their stand at the West Shore Farmers Market on Fridays and Saturdays for your craft brew fix!","website":"http:\/\/www.riverbendhopfarmandbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UKiBla\/upload_RQYafm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UKiBla\/upload_RQYafm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UKiBla\/upload_RQYafm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UKiBla\/upload_RQYafm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UKiBla\/upload_RQYafm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:00:06","updateDate":"2019-08-13 16:52:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IVY86JTO70","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8M72tS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 Lower Bailey Road","locality":"Newport","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17074","phone":"(717) 315-6764","website":"http:\/\/www.riverbendhopfarmandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: Closed,\nThursday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 5:00 PM","latitude":40.487014,"longitude":-77.09717,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:00:08","updateDate":"2018-08-17 19:00:08","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: Closed,\nThursday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 5:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KDZsJL","name":"Amber Ale","nameDisplay":"Amber Ale","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:40","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:48","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
