Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"QtDyxR","name":"612Brew","nameShortDisplay":"612Brew","description":"In the heart of the Northeast Minneapolis Arts and Brewery District, 612Brew calls Central and Broadway home. 612Brew produces small-batch beers to satisfy both the weekend beer drinker and the craft beer drinker with a discerning palate.

To add to the knowledgde they gained behind their respective bars they travelled Europe together and sampled beer from Scotland to Italy. It\u2019s a drive for diversity and complexity that makes Pampus tick. Instead of taking the easy route of perfecting a couple of popular styles, they pour out experimental batches. To make it even harder, these should preferably be low in alcohol but rank high when it comes to the complexity of their taste. Pontus is a brewery in for a challenge. After Timothy opted to focus more on the combination of beer and food at Cause Beer Loves Food, Nando continued the project, supplying Amsterdam cafes with his constantly changing range of beers.\r\n\r\nBuilding on their continuing influence in the Dutch language, the Pontus brewers often label their beers with archaic, maritime references.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

It is the 3 \u00bd year project\/vision of craft passionate, local entrepreneurs, Deborah Pallett and Scott Crighton.  Its creation was driven by a desire to restore the history of beer production to our local Lethbridge community, with the added fun of craft.\r\n\r\nCoulee Brew is a 16,000sq ft facility, with 2 separate brewing systems. A 7bbl pilot system, and a 4 vessel 30 bbl system. The tap house\/grill is a full-service pub style restaurant, with an open concept. Patrons can sit, eat and drink, while viewing all things beer through walls of glass to the facilities production area. Family friendly with 2 separate spaces for a variety of views, it was designed to welcome all in a space that felt both casual, and comfortable.\r\n\r\nCommitted to making craft a family and community experience, we didn\u2019t stop with the inside\u2026.\r\n\r\nOur huge patio welcomes everyone with large scale post and beam picnic style seating, a huge lawn and fire pit surrounded by Adirondack chairs. Full size games for the lawn, such as jenga, corn hole, battleship and connect 5, make the outdoor space as enjoyable as the inside and of course, the beer.\r\n\r\nTo keep the theme of \u2018local\u2019, design materials were sought out on a local, and recycled basis, giving everything from the walls to the tables a story to tell while having a great beer. From our own world renown Alberta- 2 Row barley and wheat, to current experimentation with local plants and vegetation, everything we do is with local in mind. Our name and our labels both showcase our pride.\r\n\r\nCoulee has quality beers, created with a respect for the history of brewing in our community, a love of craft, and a pride for all things Southern Alberta offers.","website":"http:\/\/couleebrew.co\/brewery\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wiyfKP\/upload_5d3Fjs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wiyfKP\/upload_5d3Fjs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wiyfKP\/upload_5d3Fjs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wiyfKP\/upload_5d3Fjs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wiyfKP\/upload_5d3Fjs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-11-27 20:49:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"aF80pE","name":"Coulee Brew Co.","streetAddress":"4085 2 Ave S","locality":"Lethbridge","region":"Alberta","postalCode":"T1J 1Z2","phone":"403.394.BEER (2337)","latitude":49.697168,"longitude":-112.780424,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-11-27 20:59:58","updateDate":"2017-11-27 21:04:44","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:30am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:30am-9:00pm,tue-11:30am-9:00pm,wed-11:30am-11:00pm,thu-11:30am-11:00pm,fri-11:30am-12:00am,sat-11:30am-12:00am,sun-11:30am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Edmonton","tourInfo":"Saturday Tours\r\n\u2022 Runs every Saturday at 3PM.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tour includes a 30-45min tour of the brew house and a flight of beer\r\n\r\n\u2022 Cost is $15 per person\r\n\r\n\u2022 Maximum tour group is 12 persons\r\n\r\n\u2022 Book by appointment.\r\n\r\nTour Rules\r\n\u2022 Must arrive 15 minutes before tour begins.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y5JQH3","name":"Bank Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Bank","description":"With the construction of our very own brewery in Hendricks, the sun is rising on new opportunities.
