We strive to have products on hand that will excite and satisfy all kinds of beer lovers because for us at Crow Hop Brewing, it's about the beer.","website":"http:\/\/crowhopbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9LBza2\/upload_wwiW1h-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9LBza2\/upload_wwiW1h-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9LBza2\/upload_wwiW1h-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9LBza2\/upload_wwiW1h-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9LBza2\/upload_wwiW1h-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:10:42","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:25:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5GDLB7THMA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Nmi5nc","name":"Taproom","streetAddress":"214 E 4th St.","locality":"Loveland","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80537","phone":"(970) 633-0643","website":"http:\/\/crowhopbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":40.3952936,"longitude":-105.0740559,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-22 17:11:26","updateDate":"2018-06-20 16:02:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Zmjw1p","name":"Sleepin\u2019 With Shaggy","nameDisplay":"Sleepin\u2019 With Shaggy","abv":"12.5","glasswareId":5,"styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Zmjw1p\/upload_qQigN1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Zmjw1p\/upload_qQigN1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Zmjw1p\/upload_qQigN1-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Zmjw1p\/upload_qQigN1-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Zmjw1p\/upload_qQigN1-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Zmjw1p\/upload_qQigN1-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-26 23:21:12","updateDate":"2017-01-11 03:55:34","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

We often brew hybrid styles, combining the features we like from established categories to create new, Island-Of-Doctor-Moreau-style mash-ups.\r\n\r\nFortunate Islands combines the mildly nutty malt body of a wheat beer with the intensely bright, citrusy hoppiness of a righteous IPA. Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style. We like to think that it\u2019s so traditional, it\u2019s avant-garde.\r\n\r\nWe also brew loads of special release and one-offs batches, allowing us to pursue our various whims. We have a tank dedicated to beers fermented with Brettanomyces\u2014an alternative yeast strain capable of producing wildly distinct flavors\u2014and our sour programs is just getting off the ground.\r\n\r\nOur tasting room is where we test different concepts, from variations on our core beers to experimental pilot batches.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Be watchful and clear-headed on your way home lest you begin to grow fanciful, see shapes and shadows in the night and hear things in the howling wind.

We handcraft our own beer, wine, cider, spirits and coffee. We offer an eclectic mix of pubs, historic hotels, 25 breweries, movie theaters, concert venues, spas, events and just pure fun. \r\nSince our first brew at the Hillsdale Brewery & Public House in 1985, McMenamins has produced more than 75,000 batches. \r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly. Waste products are given to local farmers, where they can be used; materials used are recycled or reused whenever possible; and second-hand equipment is largely used. Have a look at our earth-friendly brewing practices.\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales: Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Due to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment. Whether you're in Seattle, Salem, Roseburg or Portland, breweries with the iconic McMenamins name are near.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"WLxlVR","name":"SingleSpeed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"SingleSpeed","description":"Our mission is to brew beers built for the venturesome beer drinker, those unafraid to stray from the beaten path of simple flavors established by breweries much larger in size but not in creative energy.\r\n\r\nAs our name implies, we will be brewing at a slower rate of production than any of these monstrous breweries-designing and creating our hand crafted ales at one relatively slow pace, our \"single speed\", allowing each to emerge as a small artisanal batch formulated from recipes that include fresh, local, seasonal and organic ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.singlespeedbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WLxlVR\/upload_n3EgwI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WLxlVR\/upload_n3EgwI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WLxlVR\/upload_n3EgwI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WLxlVR\/upload_n3EgwI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WLxlVR\/upload_n3EgwI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-12 14:10:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:14:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5F36YA4BOI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qO5uUC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"128 Main St","locality":"Cedar Falls","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50613","phone":"(319) 266-3581","website":"http:\/\/www.singlespeedbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.536996,"longitude":-92.445211,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-12 14:11:46","updateDate":"2017-06-22 19:44:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Sr73QK","name":"SingleSpeed Brewing Co. - Waterloo","streetAddress":"325 Commercial St","locality":"Waterloo","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50701","latitude":42.4970152,"longitude":-92.3420015,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-22 19:21:40","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:39:34","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MoiXiR","name":"Slightly Mighty","nameDisplay":"Slightly Mighty","description":"Mighty hop character and just 95 calories \u2026 that can\u2019t be possible. Oh, but it is! After a year of R&D and months of fine-tuning what seemed to be unimaginable, Slightly Mighty is finally here! This true indie craft beer has all the character of a world class IPA, but with only 95 calories, 3.6g carbs, 1g protein and 0g fat per 12oz serving. Seriously.\r\n\r\nBut how? Digging deep into our culinary roots, we found our answer in an ancient Chinese delicacy - monk fruit. Sweeter than sugar per ounce, monk fruit amplifies the body and complexity of the beer, yet contains no calories. Whereas most IPAs start with a formidable malt bill to balance hoppy bitterness with malty sweetness, Slightly Mighty goes about it a different way \u2013 all through the magic of monk fruit. Most light beers are watery and lack body, but with Slightly Mighty, the monk fruit essentially acts as the beer\u2019s skeleton, on which mighty hop muscle and flavor can be built. It allows us to reduce the malt bill and avoid any unnecessary unfermentable sugars, and consequently deliver a beer that is lower in calories and carbs, and perfectly balanced.\r\n\r\nThe result is a hazy gold lo-cal IPA that throws tropical notes of pineapple, coconut, mango and citrus, all while delivering an aromatic hoppiness that makes it oh-so drinkable. Brewed with \u2018lo-cal\u2019ly grown malted barley, Slightly Mighty is dynamic and crisp with a refreshing hop profile.","abv":"4","ibu":"30","styleId":164,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MoiXiR\/upload_WbFA8w-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MoiXiR\/upload_WbFA8w-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MoiXiR\/upload_WbFA8w-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MoiXiR\/upload_WbFA8w-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MoiXiR\/upload_WbFA8w-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MoiXiR\/upload_WbFA8w-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-04-17 15:11:28","updateDate":"2019-04-17 15:11:50","style":{"id":164,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Session India Pale Ale","shortName":"Session IPA","description":"Session India Pale Ales are gold to copper.

Our hand-crafted beer is made in small batches to ensure quality and peak freshness, while the healthy and delicious menu has ingredients sourced from local farms and markets wherever possible.
