After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:15:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MPZR37EQWD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"imRFpb","name":"Element 29","nameDisplay":"Element 29","description":"100% Amarillo Hops","abv":"5.2","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/imRFpb\/upload_h2DLQu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/imRFpb\/upload_h2DLQu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/imRFpb\/upload_h2DLQu-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/imRFpb\/upload_h2DLQu-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/imRFpb\/upload_h2DLQu-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/imRFpb\/upload_h2DLQu-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-19 19:18:16","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:42:48","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation.

He started home brewing in 1994 after a year abroad studying Linguistics at The Braunschweig Technical University in Germany.  He actually caught the bug 5 years earlier on one of his high school exchange trips to Clauthal-Zellerfeld in Germany.  While on an excursion with the group to London, the father of the family he was staying with served him his homebrewed John Bull.  He would never forget it, but would wait to brew his own until the legal age of 21.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from the University of Oklahoma with degrees in International Business, German and Management Information Systems, he started a 16 year career in the Information Technology business that was very successful.  Many lasting relationships were formed during this time.  Many of his biggest supporters come from this IT family as well as his extended Soccer family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000 he and his wife moved to Tulsa into a home in the Renaissance neighborhood.  They quickly fell in love with its charm, character, neighbors, surrounding shops, accessibility and walkability.  He served as the neighborhood president for 4 years from 2006 through 2010 and ever since as Treasurer on the board.  There are so many things that they liked about living in this part of Midtown Tulsa that when they had kids they renovated their house versus moving to another part of town.\r\n\r\nGlenn continued to dream of becoming a professional brewer someday and was always looking to further his education in the brewing field.  In 2008 while taking a tour of a brewery in Hood River, Oregon he decided to start taking the necessary steps to make this dream a reality.  He began to read anything and everything beer related and of course brewed and brewed.  In October of 2011 the Hall\u2019s founded the Renaissance Brewing Company and purchased a dilapidated commercial property in their neighborhood at 12th and Lewis where they wanted to build the brewery building.  Tulsa\u2019s antiquated zoning laws, however, only allowed breweries in Industrial areas so they had to apply for a zoning variance.  Although this was a delay of over a year, Glenn never lost track of his vision.\r\n\r\nHe completed the Concise Course in Brewing Technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago, Ill. as well as the esteemed International Diploma Program from the World Brewing Academy which is a partnership between the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago and the Doemens Institute in Munich, Germany.  Glenn also successfully completed the Colorado Boy Brewery and Pub Immersion Course with the famous Tom Hennessy in Ridgway Colorado.  Tom will always be his mentor as well as all the other breweries that have helped along the way.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long journey and a long road still to tread, so Prost!","website":"http:\/\/www.renaissancebeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P07215MSRB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"orNo5d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1147 S Lewis Ave.","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74104","website":"www.renaissancebeer.com","latitude":36.1462265,"longitude":-95.9580406,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:52","updateDate":"2018-01-15 21:29:50","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8hH2hb","name":"Elemental Series: Wild IPA","nameDisplay":"Elemental Series: Wild IPA","description":"Our wild IPA is fermented with an untamed wild yeast called Saccharomyces trois.

From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:23:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A5CLS8HOXR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oPxIne","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23600 Overland Drive","extendedAddress":"#180","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"(703) 474-3050","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com","latitude":38.9629988,"longitude":-77.4992517,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:34","updateDate":"2016-03-22 17:54:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gd3seu","name":"Elements Of Funk: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis","nameDisplay":"Elements Of Funk: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis","abv":"6.5","styleId":61,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-05 05:45:06","updateDate":"2016-03-07 18:53:02","style":{"id":61,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Blonde Ale","shortName":"Belgian Blonde","description":"Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
