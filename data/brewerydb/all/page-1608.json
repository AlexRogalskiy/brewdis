Bred in the northwest US in Yakima Valley, Palisade hops typically function as complementary hops, but this IPA emphasizes their unique flavor profile. The Palisade Wasp IPA has a strong floral aroma with a hint of tangerine. Its complex flavor imparts apricot, flowers, and an earthy, grassy bitterness, accentuated by a clean, dry finish.","abv":"6.3","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qKFcSW\/upload_OGfYuG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qKFcSW\/upload_OGfYuG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qKFcSW\/upload_OGfYuG-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qKFcSW\/upload_OGfYuG-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qKFcSW\/upload_OGfYuG-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/qKFcSW\/upload_OGfYuG-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-02 14:37:28","updateDate":"2015-12-17 06:40:33","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

At Gizmo Brew Works, this meeting of contemporary technology and ancient know-how produces a tempting slate of small-batch beers. Inside tanks that hold the equivalent of 1,000 pints each, brewers prep favorites including the smooth and sweet Black Stiletto Stout and the complex Palisade Wasp India Pale Ale with the same care that has earned many of their past beers medals at the Carolina Championship of Beer. They also save room for seasonals, carefully adding a sweet caramel flavor and spicy Noble hops to their altbier. These beers and more make frequent appearances in the brewery's taproom, gracing pint glasses for impromptu toasts or filling up growlers for at-home sips. Never ones to shy away from curious guests, brewers also open up their facility for Saturday tours, walking groups through the beer-making process during 30-minute explorations.","website":"http:\/\/gizmobrewworks.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/app.expressemailmarketing.com\/Survey.aspx?SFID=161238","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-01 12:35:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:21:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JNFU1K62M8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"t98PYN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5907 Triangle Drive","locality":"Raleigh","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27617","phone":"(919) 782-2099","website":"http:\/\/gizmobrewworks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":35.8965383,"longitude":-78.7441045,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-01 12:36:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"98Qj5J","name":"The Panzer","nameDisplay":"The Panzer","description":"Made with Sweet Orange Peel, Vienna and Abbey malts.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

Our beers have received their fair share of recognition over the years, but even though we put quality first, fun is never far behind ... just look at the names of our beers. How do we come up with them? All we have to say is that there is a whole lot of creativity in those vats of beer just dying to come out, and we never stop till we get it right.","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:20:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JPLOVRX46D","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"V8LP7a","name":"Bel Air","streetAddress":"16 A Bel Air South Parkway","locality":"Bel Air","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21015","phone":"410-515-3222","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","latitude":39.4976844,"longitude":-76.3312187,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2017-05-08 18:55:15","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"n2527g","name":"Arundel Mills","streetAddress":"7000 Arundel Mills Circle","extendedAddress":"Suite R4","locality":"Hanover","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21076","phone":"410-799-1166","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun & Mon:\r\nDining Room: 11:00am -

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.
