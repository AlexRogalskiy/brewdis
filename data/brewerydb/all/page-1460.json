Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"yfDPgj","name":"Indiana City Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Indiana City","description":"It\u2019s our mission to brew innovative beers for craft beer lovers in Indy.

The team is enthused to bring a rich brewing tradition back to the Bronx and craft a beer that the people of the Bronx and New York City can be proud to call their own.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebronxbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/V0wvf7\/upload_j82fbp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/V0wvf7\/upload_j82fbp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/V0wvf7\/upload_j82fbp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/V0wvf7\/upload_j82fbp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/V0wvf7\/upload_j82fbp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:00:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KF6PXVU38Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"GZQpRX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"856 E. 136th St.","locality":"Bronx","region":"New York","postalCode":"10454","phone":"718-402-1000","website":"http:\/\/www.thebronxbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.8018969,"longitude":-73.91061,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-29 17:10:53","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SYysv2","name":"Slow-Fermented Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Slow-Fermented Brown Ale","description":"The newest offering from Switchback Brewing Company, Slow-Fermented Brown Ale is a beautiful chestnut brown colored beer.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"https:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:25:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TN7GC9UK6M","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XqkitA","name":"Sluice Box","nameDisplay":"Sluice Box","abv":"5","glasswareId":5,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XqkitA\/upload_CY2uyR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XqkitA\/upload_CY2uyR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XqkitA\/upload_CY2uyR-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XqkitA\/upload_CY2uyR-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XqkitA\/upload_CY2uyR-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XqkitA\/upload_CY2uyR-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:14","updateDate":"2015-12-16 12:38:33","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ks7ij5","name":"Bearpaw River Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Bearpaw River","description":"The Bearpaw River Brewing Company makes real hand-crafted Alaska beer for real Alaska adventures.
