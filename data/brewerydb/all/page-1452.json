Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....","website":"http:\/\/www.easternshorebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:21:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7NU39JD4ZQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wW6rQJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"605 S.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"qghrkC","name":"Firestone Walker Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Firestone Walker","description":"Founded in 1996 by Adam Firestone (aka the Bear) & David Walker (aka the Lion), Firestone Walker Brewing Company began as a small brewery with roots in wine country on California\u2019s Central Coast.

But perhaps best of all, everyone in the Allagash family loves working here.","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_1MDITb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:08:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"59XEKZTHLU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"hP5LHZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"50 Industrial Way","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04103","phone":"800-330-5385","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","latitude":43.703215,"longitude":-70.317677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:17:35","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ApQ1Sb","name":"Sixteen Letter IPA","nameDisplay":"Sixteen Letter IPA","description":"IPA brewed with Hops & Love","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-19 00:53:34","updateDate":"2017-10-19 04:09:47","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"iw1hDB","name":"Devils Backbone Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Devils Backbone","description":"2012 GREAT AMERICAN BEER FESTIVAL SMALL BREWPUB and SMALL BREWPUB BREWER OF THE YEAR & 2010 WORLD BEER CUP CHAMPION BREWERY & SMALL BREWPUB, the award winning Basecamp Brewpub is situated in the majestic valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains with a lodge style atmosphere.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
