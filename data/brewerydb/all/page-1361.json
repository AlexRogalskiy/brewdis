Rich, full-bodied and intriguing, Newfoundland Screech barrels were the inspiration for this semi-dry cider, which opens up to reveal complex notes of molasses, apples and rum. Raise a glass of Sea Cider and let your apples out of the barrel!\r\n\r\nThe Story:\r\nRumrunner cider is our homage to the people who, during Prohibition, ran illicit boats full of liquor across the international line in the coastal waters that can be seen from our Ciderhouse. This seafaring connection was first formed when we obtained Newfoundland \u201cScreech\u201d barrels to age one of our cider blends. Rum and bourbon barrels were once a cidermaker\u2019s only storage option and their use imparted distinctly spirited notes to traditional cider. Our Rumrunner cider blends the juice of highly aromatic apples, such as Stayman\u2019s Winesaps and Winter Bananas (all certified organic), so that the apple aromas match the intensity of the oak and rum notes.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:\r\nAppearance: Rich mahogany, gently effervescent.\r\nAromas, flavours: Molasses, apple butter, rum.\r\nAcid\/sweetness: Semi-dry, good acid balance.\r\nMouthfeel: Smooth, long finish.","abv":"12.5","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pears, walnuts, duck, pork, blue cheeses, aged cheddar, salty cured meats, braised meat dishes.","createDate":"2015-02-16 17:24:32","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:43:04","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.
