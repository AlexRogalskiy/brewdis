Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"kGYkIn","name":"Wild Beer Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Wild Beer Co.","description":"Wild Beer, Wild Yeasts, Wild Ingredients, Wild Ideas, Wild Ambitions...","website":"http:\/\/wildbeerco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-01 14:50:41","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ryy587","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Lower Westcombe Farm","extendedAddress":"Evercreech Shepton Mallet","locality":"Somerset","region":"England","postalCode":"BA4 6ER","website":"http:\/\/wildbeerco.com\/","latitude":51.1517774,"longitude":-2.4633889,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-01 14:52:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mBodT5","name":"Amuste","nameDisplay":"Amuste","abv":"9.3","glasswareId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mBodT5\/upload_j5uaJh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mBodT5\/upload_j5uaJh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mBodT5\/upload_j5uaJh-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mBodT5\/upload_j5uaJh-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mBodT5\/upload_j5uaJh-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/mBodT5\/upload_j5uaJh-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-10 12:19:33","updateDate":"2015-12-16 22:59:47","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

But while Matt\u2019s beer was incredible, his business plan was not (at least according to the banks) and nobody would lend him the money to start the brewery.\r\nUndaunted, he grabbed credit card applications on the way out, filled them out the same day, and opened Phillips Brewing Company on a mountain of credit card debt.  What palatial brewing fortress did this high-interest financing purchase? A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.  We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility\u2013the only one of its kind in Canada.

Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
