If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.\r\n\r\nconradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark.

For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the people we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us.

The pouring of this special m\u00e4rzen coincided with the fall harvest festival, making for one big party.

Unlike others that brew \u201cPale Ale Style\u201d  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pf\u00e4ffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don\u2019t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us \u201cThe Rothschild of Beer\u201d. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a \u201cLocal\u201d or \u201cSwiss Beer\u201d. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated \u201cKleinbrauerei\u201d\/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.  You can find us in larger COOP Stores in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland, on the Bahnhofstrasse in Jelmoli, Rio Getr\u00e4nke, Drinks of the World as well as in over 100 Restaurants and Hotels. In Z\u00fcrich, we are distributed by Heineken Distribution, Intercomestibles AG and Schatt Getr\u00e4nke. Quality without compromise. If you are ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit us!
