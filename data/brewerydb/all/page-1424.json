Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

In 2015 a vacant Rock Hill, SC car dealership was purchased and converted into a craft brewery and brewpub.  With over 11,000 square feet of space, the brewpub houses a 17-barrel brewing system along with two smaller brewing systems which can collectively produce 10,000 barrels of beer per year. Legal Remedy Brewing beers, including Alibi Ale, Witness White IPA, Sequestered Saison and Pro Bono Porter are presently served at the brewpub alongside food that is just as crafty as the beer.  In addition to on-site sales in pints, growlers and kegs, Legal Remedy Brewing beers are available in restaurants and retailers throughout South Carolina.","website":"http:\/\/legalremedybrewing.com","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EvKFaV\/upload_Avpesu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EvKFaV\/upload_Avpesu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EvKFaV\/upload_Avpesu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EvKFaV\/upload_Avpesu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/EvKFaV\/upload_Avpesu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-28 22:02:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:29:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"POQML9I8XV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WVjt2q","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"129 Oakland Ave","locality":"Rock Hill","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29732","website":"http:\/\/legalremedybrewing.com\/","latitude":34.9304266,"longitude":-81.0249672,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-31 19:26:22","updateDate":"2017-06-13 15:23:21","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hFj9R2","name":"Sequoia","nameDisplay":"Sequoia","description":"Beautiful citrus and pine notes.

Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"boTIWO","name":"Serafijn Christmas Angel","nameDisplay":"Serafijn Christmas Angel","abv":"8","styleId":63,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:12","updateDate":"2017-09-27 13:53:55","style":{"id":63,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale Strong","description":"Belgian pale strong ales are pale to golden in color with relatively light body for a beer of its alcoholic strength.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

Often brewed with light colored Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers are well attenuated. The perception of hop bitterness is medium-low to medium -high, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:16"},"breweries":[{"id":"4OBVPn","name":"Brooklyn Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Brooklyn","description":"In 1988, Steve Hindy took his homebrewing knowledge from his days as a foreign war correspondent and started The Brooklyn Brewery with his friend Tom Potter.

The brewery, located conveniently on Blue Star Highway in Douglas, Michigan, boasts two tasting rooms and outdoor patio dining. The Pub features 16 taps, hard cider, and wine along with a full food menu including everything from unique entrees to shareable appetizers. Free, live music increases the dining experience every Saturday at 6:00 pm, along with live music on the Patio every Thursday at 6:00 pm from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Along with the Pub, the Saugatuck Brewing Company recently added on a second tap room, which has been dubbed \"The Barrel Room,\" including 15 additional taps and a variety of munchies. The Barrel Room is a laid-back tasting room where customers can enjoy a pint while playing a round of one of the many games featured, like shuffleboard, bumper pool, pinball and more.\r\n\r\nSaugatuck Brewing Company is also proud to be the only location in the state of Michigan to offer a \"Brew On Premise\"  program, where customers can come in and brew their own beer on our 3.5 barrel Brew System located in the Pub. All of the beer offered at the Saugatuck Brewing Company is brewed on site on a 45 barrel Brew System in the 14,000 square foot Production Facility. Customers can tour the facility every Saturday at 2:00 pm for $7.50\/person. Each tour includes a complimentary tasting and their choice of a logo'd pint glass or growler to take home.\r\n\r\nThe Saugatuck Brewing Company bottles 7 styles year round, including everything from a crisp Blonde Ale to exciting flavored stouts. SBC also offers a variety of interesting styles throughout the year as bottled seasonals, specialty releases and draft only beers.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"beerVariation":{"id":"SYGqdH","name":"Serum","nameDisplay":"Serum","abv":"8.3","ibu":"80","styleId":31,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:12","updateDate":"2015-12-16 08:20:39","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:27:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"Qi0V9u","name":"Service Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Service","description":"We are a veteran owned and operated craft brewery, in Savannah Georgia, dedicated to honoring those that have put their lives at risk and their country and community first.\r\n\r\nWe will donate a portion of our revenues to assist charities that support service. \r\n\r\nOur dedication to this cause is unique and our approach to craft beer is equally unique.\r\n\r\nWhile brewing our year round beers on a large scale we maintain a small batch Research and Development division to enable experimentation and innovation using locally available ingredients to connect our farmers and consumers with our beer and our mission.","website":"http:\/\/servicebrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qi0V9u\/upload_7JLEfk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qi0V9u\/upload_7JLEfk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qi0V9u\/upload_7JLEfk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qi0V9u\/upload_7JLEfk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qi0V9u\/upload_7JLEfk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 21:54:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:32:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TIPN4M8620","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"SeTV3H","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"574 Indian St.","locality":"Savannah","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"31401","latitude":32.084358,"longitude":-81.098298,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 21:56:07","updateDate":"2014-10-29 21:56:57","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"5:30pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"5:30pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"4:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-5:30pm-7:30pm,fri-5:30pm-7:30pm,sat-2:00pm-4:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
