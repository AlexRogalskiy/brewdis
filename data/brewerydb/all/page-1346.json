Whole hop leaves are de-stemmed by hand, steeped in hot water, mixed into the curds and eventually pressed into blocks. The Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, with people dedicated to service, sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world\u2019s finest handmade cheese, has received over 70 awards for taste and quality, including multiple 1st Place Medals for their Echo Mountain, Rogue River, and Oregon Blue Cheeses at both National & International cheese competitions. It is not the first time the two Rogues have collaborated \u2013 Morimoto Soba Ale Cheddar and Chocolate Stout Cheddar cheeses are available at the Rogue Creamery Cheese Shop and online store, all Rogue Ales Public Houses, as well as select gourmet retailers nationwide. Anniversary Ale was designed by Rogue Creamery owner Dave Gremmels and Rogue Ales Brewmaster John Maier to pair perfectly with the unique terroir of the Rogue-grown hops used to make the Rogue Farms Cheddar & TouVelle cheeses.
