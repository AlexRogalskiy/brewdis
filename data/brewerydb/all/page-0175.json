Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward to sharing a drink with you!","website":"http:\/\/brothersdrake.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0Y6wSh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"26 E. 5th Avenue","locality":"Columbus","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43201","phone":"614-388-8765","website":"http:\/\/brothersdrake.com\/","latitude":39.987311,"longitude":-83.004595,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"V770ht","name":"Bergamot Special Bitter","nameDisplay":"Bergamot Special Bitter","description":"English style golden ale with very light bitterness, brewed with lemon peel and then cold conditioned on Townshend's Earl Grey tea leaves.","abv":"5.1","ibu":"20","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 19:33:11","updateDate":"2014-11-18 21:07:10","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.
