This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"NCDVFz","name":"Nola Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Nola","description":"NOLA Brewing \u2013 New Orleans Lager & Ale \u2013 represents the creation of refreshing high-quality beer in the heart of New Orleans.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"PBXvz0","name":"DESTIHL Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"DESTIHL","description":"DESTIHL was founded on the promise of supporting flavor and boycotting bland.

The variety of ways they can be used in brewing and the range of flavors and aromas that they bring to beer are vast and areas in which we enjoy experimenting heavily. No surprise then that the word \"hop\" appears in our name and that the majority of our recipes begin with a specific variety or intuitive blend of hops in mind.\r\n\r\nHow we are inspired by the \"Butcher\" portion of our namesake is thankfully less bloody than the history behind it, but there are a lot of butcher-esque traits that we do draw inspiration from. All of the ones we grew up around were approachable, dependable and visibly and vocally passionate about their craft. They'd take the time to get to know you, get technical when necessary and if you wanted it, help you find something or make a recommendation. That's who we aim to be, except with hops, yeast, water and grain in a brewery instead of a butcher shop and a meat-filled counter.\r\n\r\nFinally, at some point, you'll refer to us simply as \"Hop Butcher\" (and we're cool with that), but the \"For The World\" part is an important and meaningful element of our name. It inspires the ingredients we use and the personality behind the beers we brew: unique enough for the beer geeks, approachable enough for the newcomers. It guides who we work with and where our cans and kegs are distributed...and where they might someday be distributed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHop Butcher For The World","website":"http:\/\/www.hopbutcher.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-12 16:22:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:50:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6BOINF90Y","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"mDFzjD","name":"Hop Butcher For The World","streetAddress":"1000 N.
