This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

A new experimental hop known as HBC 342 shines through to give a watermelon aroma. This beer is perfect for summer, clocking in at 5.4% ABV and 20 IBUs. Twenty five percent of the grain used in James was locally sourced from Valley Malt in Hadley. This beer was first released in July 2013. Due to the overwhelming popularity we will be bringing it back for the summer of 2014.","abv":"5.4","ibu":"20","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Chicken, pork, lightly-spiced food","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2014-06-06 11:57:08","updateDate":"2014-06-06 11:57:09","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
