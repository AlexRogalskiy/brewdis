It should be brewed with at least 30 percent rye malt, and hop rates will be low. A banana -like fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; phenolic, clove-like characteristics should also be perceived. Color is straw to dark amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. If the beer is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or light caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"25","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:17"},"breweries":[{"id":"a7z4aQ","name":"Original Gravity Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Original Gravity","description":"Original Gravity Brewing Company is well worth the trip to Milan!

The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America\u2019s taps ran dry.\r\n\r\nThe brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco\u2019s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy\u2019s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery\u2019s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Tap Room opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery\u2019s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery\u2019s original fifteen barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.   \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Speakeasy beer brands and brewing equipment were acquired by Hunters Point Brewery, a company founded by former beverage distributor, Ces Butner. Under new ownership Speakeasy Ales & Lagers will grow by leaps and bounds.

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"9","srmMax":"35","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"yW9KR5","name":"Taxman Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Taxman","description":"Taxman Brewing Company is dedicated to crafting unique, artisanal Belgian-American ales.

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3RdJak","name":"Barreled & Portered","nameDisplay":"Barreled & Portered","description":"This fine brew pours a deep brown with thin light tan head and light lacing.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"pHs1Yo","name":"River North Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"River North","description":"Independent family-owned Denver brewery crafting Adventure Fuel for the state of Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/www.rivernorthbrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-08 21:12:33","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:05:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CG6TLSE8DO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"9pFgAc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2401 Blake St #1","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80205","phone":"303.296.2617","latitude":39.7586165,"longitude":-104.9892608,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-07-08 21:13:45","updateDate":"2016-10-07 00:16:27","forwardingId":"R0qhwx","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"R0qhwx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6021 Washington St","extendedAddress":"Unit A.","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80216","phone":"(303) 296-2617","website":"http:\/\/www.rivernorthbrewery.com\/","latitude":39.8065586,"longitude":-104.9790984,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-02 23:08:33","updateDate":"2016-10-07 00:16:13","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sIqjDA","name":"Barrelmaster's Reserve","nameDisplay":"Barrelmaster's Reserve","description":"bottle,special\r\n Aged in 18years Single Malt from Highlands","abv":"7.4","availableId":2,"styleId":15,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sIqjDA\/upload_tMbSOj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sIqjDA\/upload_tMbSOj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sIqjDA\/upload_tMbSOj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sIqjDA\/upload_tMbSOj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sIqjDA\/upload_tMbSOj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sIqjDA\/upload_tMbSOj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-05 20:30:54","updateDate":"2015-12-17 21:04:15","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":15,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scotch Ale","shortName":"Scotch Ale","description":"Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4CdLe9","name":"Barrett","nameDisplay":"Barrett","description":"This beer began its life as a batch of Rosalind from our fall core of beers.

Enter the spices.  I'll admit, it seems like a really odd blend of spices.  Some of them were things we had sitting around, and some were additional ideas to supplement that blend.  My original concept was to release this in time for the holidays, but as the spices developed in the beer over the next year it didn't feel quite appropriate at that time, so it came out in Spring.  I's incredibly complex, but it is without a doubt a sipper.\r\n \r\nHere, in Brewer's Notes, I will also come clean as to three embarrassing pieces of this label that make this Literary Greats release somewhat of a collector's item.\r\n \r\nI am a pedantic nerd about spelling and literature.  So, not only does it pain me to note that this is actually Barrel Series #5 (and not #4 as the label says), but that I spelled both \"cinnamon\" AND the name of the actual beer, \"Barrett\", wrong.

The name Gentle Ben\u2019s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington.
