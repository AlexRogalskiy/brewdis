When an opportunity arose, and Bruce retired, the two friends still wanted to work together. They thought about growing hops, as Bruce is a farmer, but that became more complicated than initially determined. The next plan was to brew beer, and with Greg\u2019s passion for cycling and time trial races, they incorporated both hobbies into a brewery and came up with the theme for Bike TrAle Brewing. Opened in October, 2017, Bike TrAle feels like a comfortable living room, with all the construction on the 100 year old building done by Bruce and Greg, with little touches of cycling throughout and cozy chairs and faux cycling stools. The tap surround is hand created using three types of wood. The bar is a large slab of walnut with a live edge and finished with splashes of Greg\u2019s signature purple. A new patio was opened in the spring of 2018, adding seating for over 40. Hops are still grown on Bruce\u2019s farm a few miles from the taproom, and most of the beer is also brewed at the farm. Bike TrAle is just two blocks off the W&OD Trail, making it an easy pit stop for thirsty riders.","website":"http:\/\/biketralebrewing.com\/","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MRRijd\/upload_5bHbGy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MRRijd\/upload_5bHbGy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MRRijd\/upload_5bHbGy-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MRRijd\/upload_5bHbGy-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MRRijd\/upload_5bHbGy-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 16:20:00","updateDate":"2019-07-11 18:40:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CSFDPX48VG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"5YD6zd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"101 Loudoun Street Southeast","locality":"Leesburg","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20175","phone":"(571) 293-0050","website":"http:\/\/biketralebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 5:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 7:00 PM","latitude":39.1136151,"longitude":-77.5634868,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 16:20:02","updateDate":"2018-08-17 16:20:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 5:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 5:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 7:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"n2JHej","name":"Tainted Black Pale","nameDisplay":"Tainted Black Pale","description":"First brewed the same day a certain British company tainted something much larger than a boil kettle, Tainted Black Pale is a hybrid searching for an identity. \r\n\r\nIs it a really hoppy stout?

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

It is gaining popularity not only with beer lovers and beer drinkers, but in general with gourmets, top chefs and people who are always willing to explore new flavors and experiences and who care about what they ingest.","website":"http:\/\/www.bevog.at","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUic1G\/upload_NTTve1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUic1G\/upload_NTTve1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUic1G\/upload_NTTve1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUic1G\/upload_NTTve1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TUic1G\/upload_NTTve1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-25 19:50:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"YtP8h9","name":"Bevog","streetAddress":"Gewerbepark B 9","locality":"Bad Radkersburg","region":"Steiermark","postalCode":"8490","phone":"+43 3476 41543","website":"http:\/\/www.bevog.at","latitude":46.6864396,"longitude":16.0120422,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-25 19:53:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MhdSXT","name":"Takashi","nameDisplay":"Takashi","abv":"12.5","ibu":"61","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MhdSXT\/upload_O2shOv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MhdSXT\/upload_O2shOv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MhdSXT\/upload_O2shOv-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MhdSXT\/upload_O2shOv-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MhdSXT\/upload_O2shOv-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MhdSXT\/upload_O2shOv-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.092","createDate":"2015-01-08 19:28:09","updateDate":"2015-12-17 19:33:19","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment.

Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"doVlXA","name":"Lab Brewing @ Twisted Oak Tavern","nameShortDisplay":"The Lab","description":"Twisted Oak Tavern was established in 2015 in the heart of Agoura Hills, California.

Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"7CnTbN","name":"M.I.A.

Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PD1LOINQV7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"1MuhAY","name":"J.
