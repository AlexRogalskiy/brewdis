The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:50:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CV9L7G804B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"boQj9A","name":"Afternoon Delight","nameDisplay":"Afternoon Delight","description":"The bursts of berry flavors will ignite your senses but not too fruity.

Then, somewhere in there, you could interject a tragic event or a turning point, which there are some of those too.  But looking back on how we got here, it is more like a handful of moments, a handful of moonshot ideas, a handful of occasions where the stars aligned in a way that can only be credited to divine intervention.  But at the end of it all, we aren't doing anything utterly remarkable.  We are crafting the best beer we can, having fun doing it, but most of all, creating something.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

Drawing inspiration from this area, our Coastal\/Celtic brewery was born and continues its pursuit of the next great local beer. With names of popular favorites like Agate Ale, DelNorter Porter, and 11 Bravo IPA, we continue to respond to the guidance of uncompromising influences and local tastes.\u200b\r\n       In the early days of craft beer, our Brewmaster Rick White and his wife Carol, our C.E.O, were stationed with the U.S. Army  Engineers in Heidelberg, Germany. It was there in the midst of all the beauty that the European culture has to offer, Rick developed a great appreciation for the historical and classic international styles of beer from around the world.\r\n       After his return to the United States, Rick was always searching for great beers like the ones he enjoyed in Europe. These beers could be found in specialty shops, but they were not the fresh, local product that he craved. After years of toying with the idea of making classic beer styles at home, Carol gave him a beer making kit as a Christmas gift. Rick eagerly started this new hobby, which soon developed into a passion.  With some recipe tweaking and through the guidance of many fellow brewers and beer judges, he was able to refine his skills as a highly celebrated homebrewer.\r\n     As Rick became tired of the demands of working in the corporate world, his passion and skills for craft brewing increased. After gaining recognition from winning many local and national homebrew competitions, he was offered an internship at Big Dog\u2019s Brewing in Las Vegas, NV. After a year of helping, he found himself volunteering his time at Buckbean Brewing in Reno, NV, and finally was able to land the opportunity he had always hoped for; an entry level position at Great Basin Brewing in Reno. Putting his brewing and engineering skills to work, Rick rapidly moved up in the brewing business from bottling and canning, to brewing and project management, to head production brewer.\r\n      When an opportunity to move to Del Norte County and the beautiful north coast of California presented itself, brewing was put on hold, but not for long. Within months of moving, job opportunities diminished and Rick could see a real need for a craft brewery in a town where it was difficult to find many venues for fresh craft beer, live music, or a place for friends to gather for fun and fellowship.\r\n      Rick and Carol put their minds together and Port O\u2019Pints Brewing Company was born.  With Rick\u2019s skills for brewing and Carol\u2019s strong business and organizational management background, the brewery and pub came into fruition. They officially opened to the public on November 19th, 2015, and added a small kitchen that offers delicious, fresh pub grub in the Spring of 2017. \r\n     With the tremendous support of the local community, friends, and family, they have been able to grow and expand their presence in Del Norte County, Humboldt County, and Southern Oregon.  They can proudly say that their beer can be found on tap up and down the North Coast, with hopes to expand opportunities for their fresh, award winning brews in many more locations.\r\n   Today they are proud to be Del Norte County\u2019s oldest, most award winning brewery, with fresh new beers always in the works.\r\nThank you for visiting their brewpub, where beer is their passion.\u200b CHEERS!","website":"http:\/\/www.portopints.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hL0niq\/upload_kI5V4h-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hL0niq\/upload_kI5V4h-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hL0niq\/upload_kI5V4h-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hL0niq\/upload_kI5V4h-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hL0niq\/upload_kI5V4h-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:49:37","updateDate":"2019-08-09 14:55:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4DSQ2E1PMU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"LMPeqi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1215 Northcrest Drive","locality":"Crescent City","region":"California","postalCode":"95531","phone":"(707) 460-1154","website":"http:\/\/www.portopints.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","latitude":41.7676502,"longitude":-124.1983472,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:49:39","updateDate":"2018-08-17 18:49:39","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"v6D1IR","name":"Agate Have It","nameDisplay":"Agate Have It","abv":"5","ibu":"20","styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-19 13:00:42","updateDate":"2018-07-19 13:00:42","style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ScK6VO","name":"Agave Wheat","nameDisplay":"Agave Wheat","description":"This unfiltered, American style wheat beer is fermented with 100% Agave Nectar for a slightly spicy character.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"8LP0bh","name":"Cruz Blanca Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Cruz Blanca Cervecer\u00eda","description":"904 W.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.
