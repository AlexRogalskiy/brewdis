Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

But while Matt\u2019s beer was incredible, his business plan was not (at least according to the banks) and nobody would lend him the money to start the brewery.\r\nUndaunted, he grabbed credit card applications on the way out, filled them out the same day, and opened Phillips Brewing Company on a mountain of credit card debt.  What palatial brewing fortress did this high-interest financing purchase? A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.  We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility\u2013the only one of its kind in Canada.  The same renegade passion and creativity that drove a young brewer to start a brewery on credit cards continues to be the driving force everything that we do today.","website":"http:\/\/www.phillipsbeer.com","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 07:07:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vTSRcK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2010 Government St.","locality":"Victoria","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V8T 4P1","phone":"250 380-1912","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","latitude":48.4326736,"longitude":-123.3673092,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 15:06:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2MOHrO","name":"Burlin White","nameDisplay":"Burlin White","abv":"5.2","ibu":"4","srmId":3,"styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.044","createDate":"2016-06-03 14:40:05","updateDate":"2016-06-03 14:40:05","srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
