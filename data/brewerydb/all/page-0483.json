Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"hvWfx5","name":"Elysian Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Elysian","description":"The Elysian was founded in 1995 by principals Dick Cantwell (President\/Head Brewer), Joe Bisacca (CFO\/Head of Operations) and David Buhler (Sales & Marketing Director).

In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery\/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0VbaG5","name":"Doomsauce","nameDisplay":"Doomsauce","description":"Winter is coming to New England and to our New England IPAs!

Where go we indeed, whatever that means.","website":"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"C0zPjd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1280 North McDowell Boulevard","locality":"Petaluma","region":"California","postalCode":"94954","phone":"707 769-4495","website":"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","latitude":38.272435,"longitude":-122.662346,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-12-01 18:56:55","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"g2d9B7","name":"Chicago","streetAddress":"2607 West 17th St.","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60608","phone":"(773) 522-2503","website":"http:\/\/lagunitas.com\/","latitude":41.8579099,"longitude":-87.691899,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-25 12:10:03","updateDate":"2017-06-08 20:31:56","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"s38mA2","name":"Charleston Taproom & Beer Sanctuary","streetAddress":"161 E Bay St.","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29401","phone":"843-853-4677","latitude":32.7784426,"longitude":-79.927534,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-08 20:31:56","updateDate":"2018-08-08 15:40:53","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"u1zQ8L","name":"Doppel-Hirsch","nameDisplay":"Doppel-Hirsch","abv":"7.2","glasswareId":3,"styleId":90,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/u1zQ8L\/upload_UZxPjR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/u1zQ8L\/upload_UZxPjR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/u1zQ8L\/upload_UZxPjR-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/u1zQ8L\/upload_UZxPjR-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/u1zQ8L\/upload_UZxPjR-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/u1zQ8L\/upload_UZxPjR-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-30 19:19:43","updateDate":"2015-12-16 16:10:58","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":90,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Doppelbock","shortName":"Doppelbock","description":"Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying.

We intentionally make balanced, approachable beers that appeal to both craft beer-geeks and casual American-macro drinkers alike.","website":"http:\/\/www.centerpointbrewing.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BLESao\/upload_P0C8h7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BLESao\/upload_P0C8h7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BLESao\/upload_P0C8h7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BLESao\/upload_P0C8h7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BLESao\/upload_P0C8h7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-14 13:54:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:32:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MYT2XBCK0I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"iGGk4M","name":"Centerpoint Brewing","streetAddress":"1125 E Brookside Ave","extendedAddress":"Suite B2","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46202","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\n\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\n\r\nMonday and Tuesday: Closed","latitude":39.7830926,"longitude":-86.1356363,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-11-14 13:56:47","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:22:16","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\n\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\r\n\r\nMonday and Tuesday: Closed","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
