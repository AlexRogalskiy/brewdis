The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

As the city of Nashville grew, so did the brewery, and it quickly became apparent that expansion was necessary. The company purchased an acre and a half of land at 800 44th Avenue North, and went to work on the future of the brewery. Shortly after celebrating 4 years of business, the move from the East side to the West side began. From roughly 5000 square feet, to a brand new, state of the art, 33,000 square foot facility. When asked what the vision was for the project, Ben answered with one word, \u201cQuality\u201d.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Our goal with every recipe is authenticity\u2026 to develop a particular character that allows the beer to stand out and be remembered. It's authenticity that we crave as beer drinkers; so, it's authenticity that we strive for as brewers. We study beer, determine what we want, then manifest it! For most of us here, it's not just in brewing; it's a way of life.","website":"http:\/\/www.harrietbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CiARRy\/upload_LTAIrl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CiARRy\/upload_LTAIrl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CiARRy\/upload_LTAIrl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CiARRy\/upload_LTAIrl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CiARRy\/upload_LTAIrl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"maAk4z","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3036 Minnehaha Ave.","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55406","phone":"651-491-8979","website":"http:\/\/www.harrietbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9471444,"longitude":-93.2338704,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2017-03-15 15:16:08","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8rc5kA","name":"Wachusetts IPA","nameDisplay":"Wachusetts IPA","description":"Dry-hopped with Cascade for an awesome floral nose.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"50","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rc5kA\/upload_3XksKh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rc5kA\/upload_3XksKh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rc5kA\/upload_3XksKh-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rc5kA\/upload_3XksKh-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rc5kA\/upload_3XksKh-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8rc5kA\/upload_3XksKh-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:28","updateDate":"2018-12-20 21:46:10","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"umlCeh","name":"Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Stave","description":"Crooked Stave is a progressive, artisan brewery that strives to blend brewing science and art, through creativity and following our passion.
