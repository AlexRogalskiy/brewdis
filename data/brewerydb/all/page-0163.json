The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the people we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us.

The brewery, located conveniently on Blue Star Highway in Douglas, Michigan, boasts two tasting rooms and outdoor patio dining. The Pub features 16 taps, hard cider, and wine along with a full food menu including everything from unique entrees to shareable appetizers. Free, live music increases the dining experience every Saturday at 6:00 pm, along with live music on the Patio every Thursday at 6:00 pm from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Along with the Pub, the Saugatuck Brewing Company recently added on a second tap room, which has been dubbed \"The Barrel Room,\" including 15 additional taps and a variety of munchies. The Barrel Room is a laid-back tasting room where customers can enjoy a pint while playing a round of one of the many games featured, like shuffleboard, bumper pool, pinball and more.\r\n\r\nSaugatuck Brewing Company is also proud to be the only location in the state of Michigan to offer a \"Brew On Premise\"  program, where customers can come in and brew their own beer on our 3.5 barrel Brew System located in the Pub. All of the beer offered at the Saugatuck Brewing Company is brewed on site on a 45 barrel Brew System in the 14,000 square foot Production Facility. Customers can tour the facility every Saturday at 2:00 pm for $7.50\/person. Each tour includes a complimentary tasting and their choice of a logo'd pint glass or growler to take home.\r\n\r\nThe Saugatuck Brewing Company bottles 7 styles year round, including everything from a crisp Blonde Ale to exciting flavored stouts. SBC also offers a variety of interesting styles throughout the year as bottled seasonals, specialty releases and draft only beers. These beers can be found near and far, as they are distributed through 11 states (Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Jersey and Nebraska) along with 7 foreign markets  (United Kingdom, Western Canada, Germany, Trinidad & Tobago, Ukraine, China and South Korea). While the plan remains to grow these brands throughout the country and world, SBC will never forget that Michigan is where they are from, and where the heart is.\r\n\r\nSaugatuck Brewing Company is located on the southwest coast of Michigan on Blue Star Highway, \u00bd mile North of Exit 36 on Interstate 196.

Pale to very dark brown in color. Additions of caramel coloring are sometimes employed to adjust color. They are light bodied with relatively low carbonation with limited aftertaste. The mouth feel is light to moderate, though higher than one might anticipate, usually because of unfermented sugars\/malt sugars. Malted barley, wheat and rye may be used as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats and corn. A mild malt character could be evident. Aroma\/Flavor hops are most commonly used to employ a flavor balance that is only low in bitterness. Traditional versions do not use artificial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions of this beer incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to a perception of smoothness. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in barely perceptible amounts, but this is not common. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may choose to break out subcategories of Traditional and Modern.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"0.5","abvMax":"3.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.008","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.034","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"pmdkR9","name":"Living The Dream Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Living The Dream","description":"We are a dog friendly brewery & taproom located in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/www.livingthedreambrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pmdkR9\/upload_r04APX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pmdkR9\/upload_r04APX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pmdkR9\/upload_r04APX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pmdkR9\/upload_r04APX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pmdkR9\/upload_r04APX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-28 11:56:41","updateDate":"2019-07-09 18:59:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TOM1CEXINY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Nde0Xy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12305 Dumont Way","extendedAddress":"Unit A","locality":"Littleton","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80125","phone":"(303) 284-9585","website":"http:\/\/www.livingthedreambrewing.com","latitude":39.540332,"longitude":-105.039832,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-28 11:57:15","updateDate":"2015-08-14 15:48:19","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6aqF70","name":"Belgian Brunette","nameDisplay":"Belgian Brunette","abv":"6.2","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6aqF70\/upload_lHJPgj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6aqF70\/upload_lHJPgj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6aqF70\/upload_lHJPgj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6aqF70\/upload_lHJPgj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6aqF70\/upload_lHJPgj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6aqF70\/upload_lHJPgj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-10 11:53:14","updateDate":"2015-12-17 05:52:09","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
