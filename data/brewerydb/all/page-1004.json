Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"}},{"id":"KTuitm","name":"Marionberry Lavender Sour Ale","nameDisplay":"Marionberry Lavender Sour Ale","description":"A luscious infusion of intricate flavors, this American sour sale drifts through tart patches of Oregon Marionberry and aromatic fields of lavender to a light,lemony finish.","abv":"4.3","ibu":"10","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KTuitm\/upload_qoauYc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KTuitm\/upload_qoauYc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KTuitm\/upload_qoauYc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KTuitm\/upload_qoauYc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KTuitm\/upload_qoauYc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/KTuitm\/upload_qoauYc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-12 10:55:07","updateDate":"2019-07-12 10:55:18","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.
