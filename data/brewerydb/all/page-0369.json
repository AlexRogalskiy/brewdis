We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Thomas Jefferson was a vocal supporter of the establishment of Hundreds to be used in the United States of America.  He believed that the hundred was the perfect amount of families to self-govern and educate but small enough that everyone could know each other well.  We invite you to become a part of our Gibb\u2019s Hundred and enjoy some good conversation and great beer with us.","website":"http:\/\/www.gibbshundred.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fsNEt0\/upload_F3ChzC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fsNEt0\/upload_F3ChzC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fsNEt0\/upload_F3ChzC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fsNEt0\/upload_F3ChzC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fsNEt0\/upload_F3ChzC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-17 16:18:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:26:26","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5P4DA96EFB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"ojHILP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"117 W Lewis Street","locality":"Greensboro","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27406","phone":"336-763-7087","website":"http:\/\/www.gibbshundred.com\/","latitude":36.065851,"longitude":-79.791772,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-17 16:19:57","updateDate":"2015-03-05 21:38:31","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"61E5KL","name":"Citra!

Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"b72jaO","name":"Marz Community Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Marz Brewing","description":"MARZ COMMUNITY BREWING CO.
