At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YcrREa","name":"Broad St. Pale","nameDisplay":"Broad St. Pale","abv":"5.5","ibu":"35","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-05-27 00:56:32","updateDate":"2017-05-27 00:56:32","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"YytkpO","name":"Brewer's Art","nameShortDisplay":"Brewer's Art","description":"Set in a grand Mt.

With additional holding tanks and a bottling line located directly across the street at 28 Broadway, MBBCo's process requires great attention to detail and is very labor intensive. This delicate care sets our final product apart from other mass-produced brewing competitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year we have 7 beers on tap at the Maumee Bay Brew Pub, including the historical Buckeye Beer. Additionally, our beers are available at all of the restaurants in the historic Oliver House. Come enjoy our craft beer paired with Toledo's best steak at Rockwell's or enjoy a pint with a pizza baked in our wood oven at the Pub. Enjoy a brewer's sample and some classic gaming at Mutz. It's simply a great place to be - in a whole lot of old and new ways! Our beer is also available for sale in half-gallon growlers \"to go.\" We have twelve packs and kegs of Buckeye Beer available, plus kegs of select craft beers like Oktoberfest and Blitzen Ale seasonally.","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:33:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GCUYBF2Q4A","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cSJ6eN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 Broadway","locality":"Toledo","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43602","phone":"419-243-1302","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday \u2013 Thursday 3p.m. - 10p.m.\r\nFriday and Saturdays 3p.m.- 11p.m.","latitude":41.6432338,"longitude":-83.5384216,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday \u2013 Thursday 3p.m. - 10p.m.\r\nFriday and Saturdays 3p.m.- 11p.m.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"mJEOcA","name":"North High Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"North High","description":"Award winning craft brewery located in Columbus, OH.","website":"http:\/\/www.northhighbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_xFUjA0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:34:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:06:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZL9X3VN6AJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"FOC78c","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1288 N High St.","locality":"Columbus","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43201","phone":"(614) 407-5278","website":"http:\/\/www.NorthHighBrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Fri: 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\r\nSat - Sun: 11:00 am - 2:00 am","latitude":39.9886815,"longitude":-83.0054302,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:35:24","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:51:44","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Fri: 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\r\nSat - Sun: 11:00 am - 2:00 am","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"0fjfSD","name":"North High Brewing Taproom","streetAddress":"1288 N.
