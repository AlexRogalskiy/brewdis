Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"bZCYqk","name":"Jack's Abby Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Jack's Abby","description":"Jack's Abby Brewing was formally founded in January of 2011 by three brothers, Jack, Eric and Sam Hendler, who grew up in a family business.
