There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Oj9rBb","name":"Short's Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Short's","description":"THE SHORT\u2019S STORY BEGAN IN 2002 when a 22-year-old brewer named Joe Short registered Short\u2019s Brewing Company as a business in the state of Michigan. Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IHL7x1","name":"Critz's Apple Ale","nameDisplay":"Critz's Apple Ale","description":"Critz's Apple Ale is an American wheat beer with apple cider added prior to fermentation for a fresh, tart, apple taste.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:35:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:29:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RNB6XQT9DA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1mRL8J","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7144 183rd St","locality":"Tinley Park","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60477","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","latitude":41.5593734,"longitude":-87.7911748,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:01","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:00:50","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5aG56S","name":"Crooked Beak with Passion Fruit","nameDisplay":"Crooked Beak with Passion Fruit","description":"For this limited variant of our popular Crooked Beak IPA, we added a large portion of Passion Fruit puree post fermentation.

The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
