Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

Our name is a fusion of 'brewery' with our family name, Rue.\r\n\r\nOur calling is to create beers with character and depth using the simplest and purest of means. We do not filter or pasteurize our beers. Most of our bottled beers gain carbonation through bottle conditioning, allowing carbonation to naturally occur through a secondary bottle fermentation. We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PD1LOINQV7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rYUsNg","name":"9 Lives","nameDisplay":"9 Lives","description":"Columbus and Exp 727 hops.","abv":"6.8","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-02-28 14:07:29","updateDate":"2019-02-28 14:10:07","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

In order to make this place extra spectacular, the Maitas partnered with general and managing partner of local favorites Bridges and the Vine, Randy Negi. We knew this alliance would ensure we compliment great craft beer with incredible food. Put our passions together, and a fun spot called Danville Brewing Co. is born. Our head brewer, Matt Sager is a UC Davis Master Brewers program graduate and has been an award winning brewer for 20 years. Matt has engineered some worthy brews and he\u2019s always eager to \u201ctalk shop\u201d, so when you see him on site or any of us around, feel free to say hi.

Named after the Interstate that links our Meaderies from Florida to New Jersey. The concept was to produce a mead that blurs the lines between mead and wine and truly comes across as a red wine.   There was a catch, we would not use grapes in the mead.  So we deconstructed the flavors of red wines a bit and blended black currants, blackberries, black cherries and blueberries.  We chose desert Mesquite honey for some earthiness and then aged the product on French Oak staves for a few months.  The goal being to elicit the same woody character you might see in a nice French Bourdeaux. I\u2019m pretty tickled with how this one played out.  It definitely hits the target of a red wine.  The French Oak aroma wafts gently from the glass.  The color is deep red with long, long legs.  Great fruit with some acidity as you might expect from the currants.  Medium tannins to hold it all together.  Bold but most importantly it\u2019s dry.  We wanted to make a \u201cwith dinner\u201d mead as opposed to an \u201cafter dinner\u201d type beverage.  In this regard, we nailed it.

I don't know that we recognized at the time that it was a life altering event; but, mostly out of desire to have more mead in our lives that measured up to the quality we had experienced from them we decided to start making our own.  Having no local meadmakers to draw from, this gave us the luxury of being unafraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients not associated with meads.  Some experiments failed and others worked great, all had a powerful influence on how we saw mead and what we thought mead could be.\r\nLike any hobby we dove face first into meadmaking.  Our goal was simple, to create memorable experiences through mead using locally produced ingredients to the extent possible.  Soon we were sharing those meads with friends and they shared them with others. I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.
