Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:20:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q8W2M631AI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gOFe3M","name":"White Linen","nameDisplay":"White Linen","abv":"7","ibu":"70","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-10 17:43:13","updateDate":"2017-08-10 17:43:13","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Gueuze is always referrmented in the bottle. These unflavored blended and secondary fermented lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and are characterized by intense fruity-estery, sour, and acidic aromas and flavors. These pale beers are brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Diacetyl should be absent. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Cloudiness is acceptable. These beers are quite dry and light bodied. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional gueuze lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.8","abvMax":"8.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:40"},"breweries":[{"id":"hpK1X5","name":"O'so Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"O'so","description":"3028 Village Park Dr. Plover WI\r\n\r\nArtisan brewery specializing in barrel aged sour beers and all things incredibly hoppy","website":"http:\/\/www.osobrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hpK1X5\/upload_R56Fwl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:23:32","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4TGPEFX23J","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ILdv2n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3028 Village Park Drive","locality":"Plover","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54467","phone":"715-254-2163","website":"http:\/\/www.osobrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday -Saturday 9:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m.\r\nSunday 10 a.m. - 4 p.m.","latitude":44.452355,"longitude":-89.523162,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday -Saturday 9:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m.\r\nSunday 10 a.m. - 4 p.m.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"VVErmk","name":"Funk Factory Geuzeria","nameShortDisplay":"Funk Factory","website":"http:\/\/www.funkfactorygeuzeria.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VVErmk\/upload_g3hwQf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-03 17:28:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:40:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2T5N3LR1C0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"jdQySZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1604 Gilson St.","locality":"Madison","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53715","latitude":43.049881,"longitude":-89.3920016,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-03 17:29:03","updateDate":"2015-09-03 17:29:03","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VCOezh","name":"White Magick of the Sun","nameDisplay":"White Magick of the Sun","description":"This Wheat ale is made with a little Voodoo Twist.

The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"4Z9Rzf","name":"Sailfish Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sailfish","description":"Sailfish Brewing Company is located in downtown Ft.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"H9RdES","name":"Garage Project","nameShortDisplay":"Garage Project","description":"Garage Project was started by Pete Gillespie & Jos Ruffell with help from Pete\u2019s brother Ian.

Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994.

Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle.

At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7L1oRa","name":"White Oak Whiskey BA Peanut Butter and Cacao Nib Imperial Stout","nameDisplay":"White Oak Whiskey BA Peanut Butter and Cacao Nib Imperial Stout","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-30 15:30:33","updateDate":"2019-05-30 15:30:33","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

A pleasure to imbibe and a wonder to behold, White Rabbit demands that you think and taste for yourself.","abv":"5.9","ibu":"27","glasswareId":8,"availableId":4,"styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5U8ZQu\/upload_TQvjZG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5U8ZQu\/upload_TQvjZG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5U8ZQu\/upload_TQvjZG-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5U8ZQu\/upload_TQvjZG-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5U8ZQu\/upload_TQvjZG-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5U8ZQu\/upload_TQvjZG-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2014-01-16 18:38:21","updateDate":"2016-06-07 18:36:07","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is intended to be served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is acceptable.
