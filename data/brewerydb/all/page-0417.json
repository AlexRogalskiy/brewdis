Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nUT6v5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2072 Stoneman Circle","locality":"Lakewood","region":"New York","postalCode":"14750","phone":"716-763-5479","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1008305,"longitude":-79.3356897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-27 14:23:02","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OJrSkt","name":"Southern Tier Brewing Company-Pittsburgh","streetAddress":"316 N Shore Dr.","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15212","phone":"(412) 301-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.stbcbeer.com\/capabilities-view\/about-stbc-pittsburgh\/","latitude":40.4463787,"longitude":-80.0104128,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-09 00:10:10","updateDate":"2018-04-10 14:11:48","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GAX515","name":"Creme Brulee IPA","nameDisplay":"Creme Brulee IPA","description":"Our IPA dry-hopped with Mosaic.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

Growler fills, 6 and 4 packs, and 1\/6 kegs are all available for take out to enjoy Cricket Hill at home!","website":"http:\/\/www.crickethillbrewery.com\/","established":"2001","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/CricketHillEmailSignUp","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_u03XhT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_u03XhT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_u03XhT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_u03XhT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_u03XhT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:45:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CWMH73LV9N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"ecNEQD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"24 Kulick Road","locality":"Fairfield","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"07004","phone":"973-276-9415","website":"http:\/\/www.crickethillbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.872566,"longitude":-74.296359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:18:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8tDqTV","name":"Cricket Song","nameDisplay":"Cricket Song","description":"Just as the cricket chirped at sunset for the villagers of the place of many trees, we too now give you a melody of the bitter and the sweat.

All Legend beers are unpasteurized and made from only two-row and specialty barley malt, hops, water and yeast.","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:30:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"US6ZJ8REMX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ujtlp3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"321 West 7th Street","locality":"Richmond","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23224","phone":"804-232-3446","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat:\t11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun:\t12:30 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.526596,"longitude":-77.442841,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\t11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat:\t11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun:\t12:30 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
