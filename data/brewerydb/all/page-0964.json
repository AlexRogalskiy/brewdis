Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},{"id":"A8Iqo6","name":"London Homesick Ale","nameDisplay":"London Homesick Ale","description":"A bright Texas session ale made with copious amounts of English Challenger hops and a classic English yeast strain \u2013 this beer is sure to make you feel right at home, no matter where you find yourself.","abv":"4.9","ibu":"27","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":4,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A8Iqo6\/upload_KHsldg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A8Iqo6\/upload_KHsldg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A8Iqo6\/upload_KHsldg-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A8Iqo6\/upload_KHsldg-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A8Iqo6\/upload_KHsldg-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/A8Iqo6\/upload_KHsldg-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.048","createDate":"2014-05-22 14:38:15","updateDate":"2017-09-06 14:42:27","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":4,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Special Bitter or Best Bitter","shortName":"Special Bitter","description":"Special bitter is more robust than ordinary bitter.
