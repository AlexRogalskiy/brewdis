Ludlow's population boomed with new construction in the 1920s and declined when folks moved to the burbs after World War II. In 1946 the city began sponsoring its annual Memorial Day parade for veterans, and the Ludlow Theatre opened its doors.

Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"}},{"id":"zz2QUa","name":"Ludwig's Revenge","nameDisplay":"Ludwig's Revenge","description":"This brew was inspired by the historical burning of our hometown of Chambersburg, PA in July 1864. During the burning, the brewery in town, Ludwig's Brewery operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier Germany which is where the style was born and in by coincidence the same area where Ludwig himself was born and taught to brew. It is made with a special birch wood smoked malt that imparts a light smoky aroma taste and dryness to the palate. The pilsner malt and noble German hops are used to balance this dryness making it very enjoyable as well as different. We believe this beer resembles how Ludwig himself might have brewed it over 100 years ago.","abv":"5","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:38","updateDate":"2015-05-22 02:31:26","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
