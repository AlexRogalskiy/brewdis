Taking that philosophy into mind when designing recipes, brewing beer,picking styles and brands, We are very proud of what we are doing.\r\n\r\nWe believe in a regional base with a national eye. Our brewery is named for a road that goes right thru the nearby Kennesaw Mountain Civil War battlefield. Head of the BHB, Scott Hedeen, was a mass comm major at Towson State in MD with a history minor. Lover of the Civil War, Scott decided to come up with beers with stories. Stories not based on \"who was who's\" side... but more of the drama,the guts and the lifestyle of the soldiers on both sides. Not to make someone feel as though they are getting whopped over the head with history and facts... the beers...such as \"Old Wooden Head\" (our Imperial IPA... named for Confederate General John Bell Hood...who was a principal player in the battle.. and nicknamed that by this troops for his tenacity)... are made more for the spirit and the feel of the time...mixed with a modern cool feel.","website":"http:\/\/www.burnthickorybrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:56:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:14:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZVPQUDJ0XG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"So1N3d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2260 Moon Station Ct","extendedAddress":"Suite 210","locality":"Kennesaw","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30144","website":"http:\/\/www.burnthickorybrewery.com\/","latitude":34.033027,"longitude":-84.61663,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:57:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7SQHu3","name":"Big Shark Grapefruit Radler","nameDisplay":"Big Shark Grapefruit Radler","description":"Blend of pale lager and house-made grapefruit soda.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"jDg4xl","name":"BearWaters Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"BearWaters","description":"BearWaters Brewing Company is located in Canton, North Carolina in the beautiful Smoky Mountains of Western North Carolina.

Years of minor tweaks, arguments over hop profiles, and experiments with different brands of base malts are poured into every glass that we brew.","website":"http:\/\/mondaynightbrewing.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1cfDau\/upload_WnG4pp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:59:16","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"K3IB1ZDXWV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"pGgCWL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"670 Trabert Ave","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30318","phone":"(404) 352-7703","website":"http:\/\/mondaynightbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nThu: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm","latitude":33.794919,"longitude":-84.40989,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2018-06-05 19:59:01","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nThu: 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RYTrew","name":"Monday NIght Garage","streetAddress":"933 Lee St. SW","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30310","website":"http:\/\/www.mondaynightbrewing.com\/garage","latitude":33.729001,"longitude":-84.4174307,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-05 19:37:39","updateDate":"2018-06-05 19:59:00","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"67lPiS","name":"Big Sound Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Big Sound Scotch Ale","description":"Big Sound Scotch Ale is dedicated to our good buddy Gino, the most punk rock bagpiper you'll ever meet, and the rest of the men and women of Tampa Bay Pipes and Drums.

Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"xSJ5ad","name":"Big Thompson Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Big Thompson","description":"Established in Dec 2015, Big Thompson Brewery is located at 114 E. 15th Street, Loveland, CO in the \u201cold Skate Castle Building\u201d (Behind the Blackjack Pizza and Mister Money on Cleveland Ave).\r\n\r\nWhy Big Thompson Brewery? \u2013 It all started with the drive up the canyon and the gorgeous views of the powerful Big Thompson River.
