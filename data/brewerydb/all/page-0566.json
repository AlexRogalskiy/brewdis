Brettanomyces produced flavors and aromas are not part of character. A fruity-estery character which is often cherry-like is apparent with no hop flavor or aroma. Flanders brown ales have low to medium bitterness and a cocoa-like character from roast malt. Roasted malt character in aroma and flavor is acceptable at low levels. A very low degree of malt sweetness may be present and in balance with the acidity produced by Lactobacillus activity. Oak-like or woody characters may be pleasantly integrated into overall palate. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Some versions may be more highly carbonated and, when bottle conditioned, may appear cloudy (yeast) when served. These final beers are often blended old with new before packaging in order to create the brewer's intended balance of characters.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"6.5","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:39"},"breweries":[{"id":"02Ne4w","name":"Iron Hill Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Iron Hill","description":"Welcome to Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, where you'll find fine handcrafted beers, creative yet informal cuisine, and friendly, attentive service in a casual, upscale atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe're passionate about producing distinctive, full-flavored handcrafted beers, accompanied by fresh\u2013from\u2013scratch New American cuisine in a comfortable, casual atmosphere.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

This top-fermented, unfiltered Wheat Bock beer is the counterpart to Bayern\u2019s famous Doppelbock Lager and is decoction-brewed, a technique used often in Bavaria but seldom in the US. The recipe uses five types of malt (Wheat, Pilsener, Carmel, Munich and Chocolate), and has an o.g. of  17 % Plato, producing a stout 7.5 % Alc. by Vol. As with all Bayern wheat beers, Face Plant surprises with its complex flavor. German Hallertauer Perle hops give this hearty Bock beer a perfectly balanced sweetness.\r\n The formulation for this delicate beer came from the Brauerei zum Schiff in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria. Bayern Brewing\u2019s proprietor, J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller, was one of the last of five brewers that brewed this special beer in 1979 before the brewery, which was founded in 1540, sadly closed its doors due to the owner\u2019s passing. \r\n In fall of 2007, when it became apparent that the crisis of extremely high raw material prices would continue, the Bayern team decided to test the market with a brew that uses a very large amount of energy and raw materials while being the most difficult, labor-intensive, demanding beer that anyone could create. We told our distributors that we would do two brews at 1000 gallons each to see whether the market could handle the premium price that we had to charge due to these factors. \r\n Our \"Super Brew\" lasted only a couple of months and then completely sold out. \r\n So Bayern Brewing continues to brew Face Plant while its popularity continues to grow. Thus Doppelweizen has been revived here in Missoula, Montana, USA. We hope you will enjoy a piece of living beer history and a specialty beer that is truly rare, even in the Northwest\u2019s highly diversified beer landscape.","abv":"7.5","ibu":"18","availableId":4,"styleId":52,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/IJCPu1\/upload_gjWwg1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/IJCPu1\/upload_gjWwg1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/IJCPu1\/upload_gjWwg1-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/IJCPu1\/upload_gjWwg1-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/IJCPu1\/upload_gjWwg1-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/IJCPu1\/upload_gjWwg1-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 18:24:57","updateDate":"2015-12-18 00:51:15","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":52,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Dunkel Weizen \/ Dunkel Weissbier","shortName":"Dunkelweizen","description":"This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt.

This new system will help us meet the growing demand in our state.","website":"http:\/\/dragonmead.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9HcWSd\/upload_AqPobI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:19:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6RY4IFN1EX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"OyQarF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"14600 East Eleven Mile Road","locality":"Warren","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48089","phone":"586-776-9428","website":"http:\/\/dragonmead.com\/","latitude":42.493159,"longitude":-82.9741767,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fn1jXM","name":"Faceplant IIPA","nameDisplay":"Faceplant IIPA","abv":"8","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-19 20:16:23","updateDate":"2018-04-26 20:17:38","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Just great hand-crafted beer brewed in West London with the best ingredients, knowledge, and respect for process, and a little insanity.\r\n\r\nBut why stop there? We don\u2019t believe in being stereotyped. We love upfront in-your-face hop focused beers, but are we only going to brew these? Hell no! We love beer, and we will brew whatever we want, whenever it suits us.\r\n\r\nAt Weird Beard we aim to continue making experimental, no-holds-barred beers that we feel excited about and we want to drink.\r\n\r\nInspired by the American and burgeoning British craft beer movement, along with great music, exquisite food, epic beards, and the outstanding beer community in our hometown of London, Weird Beard Brew Co will not compromise on anything to bring the best flavours to the beer, whether it is the roasted specialty grains in a stout or the newest hops in an IPA. We create beers that push the boundaries of style, forcing the consumer to stop and think about the drink in front of them, to confront the misconceptions of what ale and beer should or can be, and who drinks it? \r\n\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, Gregg and Bryan do sport some very impressive facial hair. Here at Weird Beard Brew Co we are all about the beards, but not so much the sandals. We are passionate about good beer, no matter where it comes from or how it is dispensed. You will find us in bottle shops, on cask in real ale pubs and in the best London beer bars on keg.\r\n\r\nWeird Beard Brew Co is a full on, no compromise brewery, brewing great tasting and genre-busting beers...hold on to your taste buds and come along for the ride!","website":"http:\/\/www.weirdbeardbrewco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 17:37:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"p0vg5z","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Boston Business Park","extendedAddress":"Unit 5","locality":"Hanwell","region":"London","postalCode":"W72QA","phone":"0203 645 2711","latitude":51.5000484,"longitude":-0.338234,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 17:59:01","updateDate":"2014-11-10 17:59:01","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":27,"name":"Citra","description":"Comprised of Hallertau Mittelfr\u00fch, US Tettnang, Brewer's Gold and East Kent Golding","alphaAcidMin":11,"alphaAcidMax":13,"betaAcidMin":3.5,"betaAcidMax":4.5,"humuleneMin":11,"humuleneMax":13,"caryophylleneMin":6,"caryophylleneMax":8,"cohumuloneMin":22,"cohumuloneMax":24,"myrceneMin":60,"myrceneMax":65,"farneseneMax":1,"isNoble":"N","forBittering":"N","forFlavor":"Y","forAroma":"Y","category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:28","updateDate":"2015-09-24 13:38:05"},{"id":122,"name":"Sorachi Ace","category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:36"},{"id":135,"name":"Summit","description":"The first hedgerow (dwarf) hop variety to be grown commercially in the United States, and the first to be available to home hop growers as a rhizome, Summit is perhaps the strongest bittering hop available based on early crops.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style export ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style export ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style export ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"mzRqp5","name":"Castle Rock Beer Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Castle Rock Beer Co.","description":"An English-Style Craft Brewery located in Castle Rock, Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/www.CastleRockBeerCo.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mzRqp5\/upload_1j1ub6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mzRqp5\/upload_1j1ub6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mzRqp5\/upload_1j1ub6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mzRqp5\/upload_1j1ub6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mzRqp5\/upload_1j1ub6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-07 16:00:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"flgniI","name":"CRBC Main Location","streetAddress":"514 N Perry St.","extendedAddress":"C106","locality":"Castle Rock","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80104","phone":"720-328-9008","website":"http:\/\/www.castlerockbeerco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thurs: 3pm-9pm\r\nFri-Sat: 11am-10pm\r\nSun: 11am-9pm","latitude":39.374909,"longitude":-104.858296,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-08 00:00:35","updateDate":"2016-06-09 14:37:01","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon-Thurs: 3pm-9pm\r\nFri-Sat: 11am-10pm\r\nSun: 11am-9pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"iqeuAv","name":"Fadglad","nameDisplay":"Fadglad","description":"Wild Danish Cider BA","abv":"5.9","styleId":149,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-01-23 14:25:15","updateDate":"2019-01-23 14:25:15","style":{"id":149,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Common Cider","shortName":"Common Cider","description":"Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it.
