Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America\u2019s taps ran dry.\r\n\r\nThe brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco\u2019s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy\u2019s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery\u2019s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Tap Room opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery\u2019s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery\u2019s original fifteen barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.   \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Speakeasy beer brands and brewing equipment were acquired by Hunters Point Brewery, a company founded by former beverage distributor, Ces Butner. Under new ownership Speakeasy Ales & Lagers will grow by leaps and bounds. The brewery\u2019s trademark eyes, ubiquitous and cryptic, beckon you to join our mob, no password required.","website":"http:\/\/www.goodbeer.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_zLVYs0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:46:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0BHXDML1I5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"t559gG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1195-A Evans Avenue","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94124","phone":"415-642-3371","website":"http:\/\/www.goodbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t9:00 am - 10:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:\t12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.7382569,"longitude":-122.3802492,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\t9:00 am - 10:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:\t12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Fxw61G","name":"Tally Ho","nameDisplay":"Tally Ho","description":"Brewed with Pale Ale, Crystal and Brown malts.

For the uninitiated, the tamarind tree, which grows in tropical regions, produces a pod-like fruit with large seeds and a sticky pulp. These guys have an intensely tart flavor and are commonly used to make thirst-quenching beverages similar to lemonade. \r\n\r\nBeamer initially deliberated on the beer style that would pair well with this unique ingredient before settling on an English brown ale. The idea was to use a medium malt body as well as fruity esters from the British yeast strain and a hint of earthy Goldings hops.

As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.  Our best example of this is our Blood Saison, an agave and Hibiscus infused Saison that come off sweet initially, middle tartness and finishing like a beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@borderxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:08:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OPB6VTC7RN","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"IDHs4u","name":"Logan Tasting Room","streetAddress":"2181 Logan Ave","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92113","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":32.6981181,"longitude":-117.1397986,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2017-06-28 14:43:12","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cRLX8x","name":"Otay Brewery","streetAddress":"8684 Avenida De La Fuente Ste 8","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92154","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","latitude":32.5566393,"longitude":-116.9567988,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-02-18 16:21:01","updateDate":"2017-06-28 14:42:41","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"11RJ4u","name":"Tamerlane Brown Porter","nameDisplay":"Tamerlane Brown Porter","description":"Edgar Allan Poe's (author of \"The Raven\") publishing career began humbly with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and other Poems (1827).

Diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"22","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"25","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:37:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"PZ9Qvv","name":"West Kill Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"West Kill","description":"On a dead end road in the heart of the Catskills, something is brewing.\r\n\r\nA business with a deep commitment to the area \u2013 to its mountains, to its people, to its heritage, to its future.\r\n\r\nAnd oh yeah: lots of great beer.\r\n\r\nWith a focus on locally grown and foraged ingredients and a soft spot for history, West Kill Brewing aims to reflect the great place it was born.

Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze.

Tim's background in brewing started in his college days at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:49:10","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZVWX7SOR0P","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HtFqFO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"831 W Bonanza Rd","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89106","phone":"702-362-7335","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","latitude":36.176722,"longitude":-115.15317,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:35:55","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
