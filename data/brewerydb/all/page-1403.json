Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

However, in the wake of the acquisition of Caledonian brewing Company by Scottish & Newcastle UK, the brewery became independent once again in 2008 by three noble shareholders who sought to preserve the status as an independent award-winning micro-brewery. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Harviestoun is going through some new and exciting changes to expand the brewery.

Schlafly brand beers are distributed to the following states: Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Western Mississippi, North Virgina, and Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nThe Saint Louis Brewery, Inc. was incorporated in 1989. It was founded by Dan Kopman and Tom Schlafly,[1] a lawyer and nephew of political activist Phyllis Schlafly, although she is not involved with the brewery in any way. Their goal was to create quality local microbrew beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.schlafly.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tNDKBY\/upload_tZcFnF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tNDKBY\/upload_tZcFnF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tNDKBY\/upload_tZcFnF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tNDKBY\/upload_tZcFnF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tNDKBY\/upload_tZcFnF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2019-03-21 12:07:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"BHV54UCSMG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ketZE5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2100 Locust Street","locality":"Saint Louis","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63103","phone":"314-241-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.schlafly.com\/","latitude":38.632968,"longitude":-90.209769,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"JyJ8dh","name":"Schlafly Bottleworks","streetAddress":"7260 Southwest Ave.","locality":"Maplewood","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63143","phone":"314-241-2337","website":"http:\/\/schlafly.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Tue: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nWed - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm","latitude":38.6130246,"longitude":-90.3153033,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-28 20:14:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Tue: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nWed - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BeVslL","name":"Schlager Lager","nameDisplay":"Schlager Lager","abv":"5.8","styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BeVslL\/upload_ueA07C-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BeVslL\/upload_ueA07C-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BeVslL\/upload_ueA07C-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BeVslL\/upload_ueA07C-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BeVslL\/upload_ueA07C-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BeVslL\/upload_ueA07C-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-15 22:38:07","updateDate":"2015-12-17 22:29:09","style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"AMspsb","name":"Schlappeseppel","nameShortDisplay":"Schlappeseppel","description":"In 1631, King Gustav from Sweden took the city of Aschaffenburg.
