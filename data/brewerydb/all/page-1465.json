Black to very deep ruby\/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Moat Mountain Smokehouse and Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Moat Mountain Smokehouse","description":"Moat Mountain is a 174-seat brew pub, restaurant & inn located in one of North Conway\u2019s historic buildings.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"12","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.035","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"sk5YLK","name":"Buffalo Bayou Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Buffalo Bayou","description":"Buffalo Bayou Brewing Company is a new twist on an old craft.

The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).\r\n\r\nLater created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

We can't wait to share our beer with Charlotte and beyond and look forward welcoming everyone to our spacious tap room very soon.","website":"http:\/\/triplecbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:30:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:30:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TC5H0XLUBR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Qfcr4y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2900 Griffith St.","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28203","phone":"704-372-3212","website":"http:\/\/www.triplecbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"MONDAY - closed \r\nTUESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nTHURSDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nFRIDAY 4 - 9 pm\r\nSATURDAY 2 - 9 pm\r\nSUNDAY 1 - 6 pm","latitude":35.200972,"longitude":-80.869119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:32:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"MONDAY - closed \r\nTUESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nTHURSDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nFRIDAY 4 - 9 pm\r\nSATURDAY 2 - 9 pm\r\nSUNDAY 1 - 6 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wrXg8j","name":"Smoked Amber","nameDisplay":"Smoked Amber","abv":"5.7","styleId":54,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wrXg8j\/upload_vy3ETk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wrXg8j\/upload_vy3ETk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wrXg8j\/upload_vy3ETk-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wrXg8j\/upload_vy3ETk-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wrXg8j\/upload_vy3ETk-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wrXg8j\/upload_vy3ETk-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-17 12:16:46","updateDate":"2015-12-17 13:43:10","style":{"id":54,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bamberg-Style Weiss (Smoke) Rauchbier (Dunkel or Helles)","shortName":"Rauchbier","description":"Bamberg-style Weiss Rauchbier should have smoky characters that range from detectable to prevalent in the aroma and flavor. Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"6qc3Dy","name":"Shebeen Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Shebeen","description":"Opened in 2013, the brewery is the place to enjoy 13 award winning rotating Connecticut craft beers beers including Baby Seal Dance Party New England IPA, Chocolate Cherry Cannoli, Cucumber Wasabi and choice lagers and ales.

We begin with cull apples, apples that are too small, misshapen, or otherwise undesirable to grocery stores and use those as the base for most of our ciders.\r\n\r\nIn early 2019, we started a brand-new brewery born from a partnership with Dirty Bucket Brewing Co, now all under the name of Locust Cider & Brewing Co. We decided to throw out conventions and start over with a new and unique approach to brewing, inspired by cidermaking methods, delivering easy-to-drink, light-bodied beer while respecting traditions but not being anchored to them.\r\n\r\nOur taprooms and cideries outside of Woodinville are part of an expansion plan to make cider more accessible to a larger audience as well as provide a space to educate on the nuances of the cider world while allowing us to localize our efforts on a deeper level in the communities where we serve.\r\n\r\nWe currently have a cider and beer production facility and taproom in Woodinville, WA, standalone taprooms in Seattle and Tacoma (with plans to open additional taprooms in greater Washington in 2019), and a cider production facility and taproom in Fort Worth, TX with another set to open in Boulder, CO this summer.\r\n\r\nCurrently cans and bottles can be found throughout Washington, Oregon, California, and Texas with plans to continue expanding distribution nationally.","website":"https:\/\/www.locustcider.com\/home\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/9mcUs1\/upload_xCjphr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-30 02:46:13","updateDate":"2019-08-22 18:42:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"hWEHWN","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Woodinville","region":"Washington","latitude":47.7542651,"longitude":-122.1634582,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-30 02:46:53","updateDate":"2016-07-30 02:46:53","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EHRs5I","name":"Smoked Brown","nameDisplay":"Smoked Brown","description":"Our Barley Buddy Brown with a few lbs. of smoked malt.","abv":"5.8","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-14 16:54:11","updateDate":"2015-01-14 16:55:57","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"Qfcr4y","name":"Kissmeyer Beer & Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Kissmeyer Beer","description":"Kissmeyer Beer and Brewing was launched in 2010 after ten years at N\u00f8rrebro Bryghus.

Chili pepper aromas ranging from subtle to intense may or may not be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Malt sweetness can vary from very low to medium-high levels, depending on the underlying beer style. Hop bitterness is very low to medium-high. Chili pepper aroma and flavor qualities should not be overpowered by hop aroma and flavor, and should be present in harmony with characteristics typical of the underlying beer style.
