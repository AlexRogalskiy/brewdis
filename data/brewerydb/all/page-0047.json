Our passion for Craft Beer got us going, sharing that passion for Craft Beer with others keeps us going.\r\n\r\n- Adam","website":"http:\/\/www.moodyales.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MHfbCE\/upload_Xrsbsf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MHfbCE\/upload_Xrsbsf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MHfbCE\/upload_Xrsbsf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MHfbCE\/upload_Xrsbsf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MHfbCE\/upload_Xrsbsf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-26 12:41:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8ej09S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2601 Murray St.","locality":"Port Moody","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V3H 1X1","phone":"+1 604-492-3911","website":"http:\/\/www.moodyales.com\/","latitude":49.2788702,"longitude":-122.854181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-26 12:43:11","updateDate":"2016-07-26 12:43:11","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"sun-12:00pm-9:00pm,mon-1:00pm-9:00pm,tue-1:00pm-9:00pm,wed-1:00pm-10:00pm,thu-1:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Vancouver","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lxh9Sg","name":"Affair with Amarillo","nameDisplay":"Affair with Amarillo","abv":"7.5","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 21:51:52","updateDate":"2015-11-30 21:51:52","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewage.at","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:45:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mMnrjZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mittelgasse 4","locality":"1060 Wien","phone":"+43 1 9550935","website":"http:\/\/brewage.at\/","latitude":48.1939642,"longitude":16.3434939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","updateDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-7:00pm,wed-2:00pm-7:00pm,thu-2:00pm-7:00pm,fri-12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"Europe\/Vienna","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Kc7f54","name":"Affilgem Rouge","nameDisplay":"Affilgem Rouge","abv":"6.7","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-03 03:16:20","updateDate":"2013-05-03 11:49:42","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

That said, there's a decent bitterness providing a sharpness, but is moderated and perfectly balanced by the subtle toffee sweetness from the malts and tropical fruit flavours.","abv":"5.4","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-17 18:41:15","updateDate":"2015-12-17 10:43:43","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

The base malt is all German Pilsener and Munich Malt (as is the typical practice of most of the high quality Belgian brewers of pale beers) with a bit of red winter wheat thrown in for body and mouthfeel and just a touch of coriander for the finish. We use a little Belgian Light Candi Sugar and a little Special B Malt to add to the Belgian character. Five mash rests are employed to improve the clarity, pH and distribution of sugars. And, four hop additions are made in the boil using a combination of German, Styrian and Czech Hops. This beer gets considerably better with about six months to a year under its belt. 5 Seasons will be serving it throughout this period, slowly meting out the kegs on a monthly basis to ensure it lasts until next year's batch is ready.","abv":"8","availableId":4,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-08 18:28:30","updateDate":"2014-10-09 13:50:04","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Brewer's Gold was never used as an aroma hop in England because of its intense flavors, but has been used experimentally as a dry hop by some American craft brewers.","countryOfOrigin":"GB","alphaAcidMin":5.5,"betaAcidMin":2.5,"betaAcidMax":3.5,"humuleneMin":29,"humuleneMax":31,"caryophylleneMin":7,"caryophylleneMax":7.5,"cohumuloneMin":40,"cohumuloneMax":48,"myrceneMin":37,"myrceneMax":40,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:27","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":378,"name":"Caramel\/Crystal Malt","category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:45"},{"id":429,"name":"Chocolate Malt","description":"A dark malt that gives a rich red or brown color and a nutty flavor, used in brown ales, porters, and some stouts.","countryOfOrigin":"US","srmId":41,"srmPrecise":350,"moistureContent":4,"coarseFineDifference":1.5,"dryYield":60,"potential":1.028,"protein":13.2,"maxInBatch":10,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"N","characteristics":[{"id":6,"name":"Chocolate","description":"Imparts a chocolate quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":7,"name":"Coffee","description":"Imparts a coffee flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":11,"name":"Nutty","description":"Imparts a nutty flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":15,"name":"Toasted","description":"Imparts a toasted flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:47","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":1922,"name":"Two-Row Pale Malt","description":"The is the standard starting point for almost all beer recipes.
