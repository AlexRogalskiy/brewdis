Its aroma is a mixture of its characteristic lemony citrus character as well having woody, minty, and ginger notes. The beer\u2019s toasted malt flavors, with a touch of caramel, is balanced against the Sorachi Ace\u2019s piney and citrusy hop flavor. Hop bitterness is assertive without being overwhelming.

As your mouth recovers' from the initial wave of intensity, dofter, more subtle flavors begin to make themselves known. Tropical fruits like passion fruit and lychee are often described playing along side a clove-like spiciness.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"tNDKBY","name":"The Saint Louis Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"The Saint Louis","description":"Schlafly is the brand name of beers produced by the Saint Louis Brewery, Inc.
