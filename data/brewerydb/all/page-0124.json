It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"6XlqQv","name":"Great Baraboo Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Great Baraboo","website":"http:\/\/greatbaraboo.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6XlqQv\/upload_LQcGl9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6XlqQv\/upload_LQcGl9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6XlqQv\/upload_LQcGl9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6XlqQv\/upload_LQcGl9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6XlqQv\/upload_LQcGl9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:25:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"3LPUO7D4H2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"C5WSMS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"35905 Utica Road","locality":"Clinton Township","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48035","phone":"586-792-7397","website":"http:\/\/greatbaraboo.com\/","latitude":42.5601937,"longitude":-82.9649787,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5Qz20N","name":"Baracus","nameDisplay":"Baracus","description":"This BABBA (Bad Attitude Big Brown Ale) is hella hoppy, with resin, citrus and pine hop flavor from intense hopping and dry hopping.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:10:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PI7THDWZB4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qo6LCf","name":"Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom","streetAddress":"1621 Moore St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-827-6025","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","latitude":39.1137948,"longitude":-84.5150108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1853","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:45:48","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"X0HMO8","name":"Christian Moerlein Lager House","streetAddress":"115 Joe Nuxhall Way","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-421-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.moerleinlagerhouse.com\/","latitude":39.0963619,"longitude":-84.5087017,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:10:31","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:46:10","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-1:00pm-8:00pm,mon-11:00am-11:00pm,tue-1:00pm-8:00pm,tue-11:00am-11:00pm,wed-1:00pm-8:00pm,wed-11:00am-11:00pm,thu-1:00pm-8:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00am,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"z6PfRf","name":"Barbary Coast Brand Gold Rush Style Beer","nameDisplay":"Barbary Coast Brand Gold Rush Style Beer","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:45","updateDate":"2018-11-02 15:20:03","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"uZs73z","name":"LETRA Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Letra","description":"LETRA is a craft beer situated in the beautiful village of Vila Verde, near Braga, the third biggest city in Portugal.

Bardstown has a wonderful aroma of vanilla, fruit, smoke, oak and alcohol. On the palate you first taste sweet malt, vanilla, ripe fruit and raisons followed closely by the warmth of alcohol and tannic oak.\r\n\r\nBardstown is the very first beer OHB has ever bottled.  It was made in very limited quantities, only about 150 cases were made.\r\n\r\nAbout the name: Bardstown is the county seat for Nelson County, Kentucky and is the host city of the annual Bourbon Festival.  Most of the famous bourbons made hail from this area of Kentucky. A few years ago Steven was visiting Bardstown and the many distillers around Kentucky.While visiting the distilleries, Steven arranged to pick up some freshly used barrels, empty less than a day.  The barrels were brought back to the brewery and filled right away. The barrels rested in the brewery for a year, full of barley wine. \r\n\r\nWhen the beer was just right, the barrels were emptied into a tank and allowed to condition before being bottled, one at a time, by hand. \r\n\r\nAs Bardstown is such a big and robust beer, as well as being 10%, it will age very well, becoming more mellow as the years pass. If you have the opportunity and the patience to keep a bottle or two back you will be well rewarded in five to ten years.","abv":"10","availableId":3,"styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-10 15:34:38","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness. Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:27:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"ichhfQ","name":"Olde Hickory Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Olde Hickory","description":"Great beer is the result of meticulous attention to detail throughout the brewing process.

One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"jdulDH","name":"Door County Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Door County","description":"Door County Brewing Company is inspired by our surrounding; our friends, our families, our landscape.
