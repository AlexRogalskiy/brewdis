Saaz and Willamette hops add subtle herbal notes.  The earthy graininess of the malt and sweetness of the carrot juice along with the spice from the ginger come together to create one healthy tasting brew.  In true soupy fashion, we decided to take the first portion of Hot Thoup! and serve it both warm and still (uncarbonated), much like a mulled wine.  Each glass will be garnished with a carrot stick. When enjoyed warm, the sweetness of the carrot juice comes through along with spicy ginger and a warming toddy-like alcohol burn.  This one would be a great pairing with the hummus plate and lighter dishes, but might be best enjoyed as a starter to your meal!","abv":"8.25","ibu":"18","availableId":3,"styleId":79,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"warm","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Warm - (14-16C\/57-61F)","createDate":"2012-08-31 09:57:28","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":79,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Dortmunder \/ European-Style Export","shortName":"Dortmunder","description":"Dortmunder has medium hop bitterness.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"}},{"id":"8dCV8s","name":"Hotline","nameDisplay":"Hotline","description":"Simcoe+Mosaic+Nelson+Citra DDH...\r\nThat can only mean one thing...","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8dCV8s\/upload_olF0ug-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8dCV8s\/upload_olF0ug-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8dCV8s\/upload_olF0ug-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8dCV8s\/upload_olF0ug-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8dCV8s\/upload_olF0ug-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8dCV8s\/upload_olF0ug-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-09 13:09:26","updateDate":"2018-04-09 13:10:28","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
