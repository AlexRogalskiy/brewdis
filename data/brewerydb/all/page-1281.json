When Aspen Brewery\u2019s head brewer, Terry Butler expressed interest in brewing a porter, it didn\u2019t take much convincing to follow through with one. After all, Terry has won medals for porters at the Great American Brew Festival in years past!  What poured out of our tap that first day the porter was ready was nothing short of euphoria.\r\n\r\nAspen is nestled between two enormous mountain ranges, the Elk Mountains, and the Sawatch Range.

Rich with complexity and flavor, try savoring it with a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine ale.\r\n\r\nAs with any higher alcohol beers, QUAD will be at its best after a period 12 months or so in the bottle, perhaps longer. We expect a shelf life of 3-5 years, but go ahead, we know you can\u2019t wait. Enjoy one now, and another every month or two, and you\u2019ll be truly amazed as QUAD gains smoothness and complexity over time as it ages.\r\n\r\nQuad is available in November and December.","abv":"11.8","ibu":"39","glasswareId":6,"availableId":4,"styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.111","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:01","updateDate":"2017-01-10 21:53:44","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
