Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops.

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"F1Wu0V","name":"Lolo Peak Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Lolo Peak","description":"Lolo Peak Brewing Company is a brewery in Lolo, Montana.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style.

Afterwards, he worked as an engineer by day, but spent most nights playing with recipes, designing brewing systems, or brewing beer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Nick traveled the world as a photojournalist covering political, social and environmental issues. He too became enthralled by brewing, going so far as to brew in single gallon batches because that was all the space he had in his New York City apartment.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve 2013, Andrew and Nick ran into one another doing some last-minute shopping. After catching up, their discussion quickly turned to home-brewing, and they promised to meet again soon. A few months later they met at a Brooklyn bar, and over a glass of Andrew\u2019s home-brewed Golden Tripel, Shire Breu-Hous was born. They haven\u2019t stopped working on it since.\r\n\r\nWhen space in the old Crane Stationery Factory became available, they knew it would be the perfect home for Shire. Construction began in the fall of 2016. They worked diligently to preserve as much of the original character of the building as possible. When part of the original hardwood floor had to be removed to install brewing equipment, they reused the wood to make a long bench seat and a majority of the table tops. The tap system and coffee table are made from parts of the old factory vacuum pump; the lounge chandelier is made from old compressed air oil filters, and the host stand is a 150-year-old type-setting table.  \r\n\r\nAndrew and Nick used materials local to the Berkshires whenever possible. They sourced marble for the lounge window sills and hearth stone from quarries in Lee (the same quarries that provided marble for the Lincoln Memorial and the headstones at Arlington National Cemetery). When an old sugar maple tree on Andrew\u2019s grandparent\u2019s land died, Nick and Andrew decided to give it a second life; this tree (the first tree ever tapped by Andrew\u2019s father and uncle when they started the family tradition of making maple syrup) is now the bar top, the soon to come banquet tables, as well as a few tap handles. We even smoke our meat in house with extra scraps of wood from that very same tree.\r\n\r\nAfter many months of construction and a lot of help from family and friends, Shire finally opened in August 2017!\r\n\r\nHere in the Berkshires, we\u2019re lucky to have access to many local ingredients, and we strive to source locally whenever possible; malt from South Egremont, liquor from a few local distilleries, meats, cheeses and produce are also purchased from many different nearby farms, and we even grow our own hops.","website":"http:\/\/shirebreuhous.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qBurBF\/upload_hpav8G-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qBurBF\/upload_hpav8G-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qBurBF\/upload_hpav8G-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qBurBF\/upload_hpav8G-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qBurBF\/upload_hpav8G-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:42:54","updateDate":"2019-08-14 15:42:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"XT36NZJ2LR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"rtau9g","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"63 Flansburg Avenue","locality":"Dalton","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01226","phone":"(413) 842-8313","website":"http:\/\/shirebreuhous.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nWednesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nThursday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nFriday: 4:00 PM \u2013 1:00 AM,\nSaturday: 10:00 AM \u2013 1:00 AM,\nSunday: 10:00 AM \u2013 3:00 PM","latitude":42.4745869,"longitude":-73.1728401,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 19:42:56","updateDate":"2018-08-17 19:42:56","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nWednesday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nThursday: 4:00 PM \u2013 12:00 AM,\nFriday: 4:00 PM \u2013 1:00 AM,\nSaturday: 10:00 AM \u2013 1:00 AM,\nSunday: 10:00 AM \u2013 3:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mF8ZMp","name":"30 Minute Coma","nameDisplay":"30 Minute Coma","description":"30 Minute Coma is a CANlaboration devised with our friends from Solemn Oath Brewery for the second annual Sun King CANvitational.

Unique character from \u201caged\u201d fresh hop beers may emerge, but they have yet to be defined.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:25"},"breweries":[{"id":"HUCz2L","name":"Fullsteam Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Fullsteam","description":"Fullsteam is a Durham, North Carolina brewery inspired by the agricultural and culinary traditions of the South.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to craft a distinctly Southern beer style using local farmed goods, heirloom grains, and Southern botanicals. Like what, you wonder? We're making beer with sweet potatoes, corn grits, summer basil, and malted barley house-smoked over hickory. Other successful \"plow to pint\" experiments to-date include beer brewed with scuppernong grapes, persimmon, paw paw, rhubarb and more. \r\n\r\nUltimately, our vision is to craft a year-round, sustainable, scalable, and distinctly Southern beer brewed 100% with local ingredients. That's the quest. We're a long ways from realizing this vision, but we hope you enjoy the adventure as much as we expect to. Interested?
