The convergence point right before you jump off into the wilderness of the Olympic National Forest on your way to the Pacific Ocean, resting between the edge of the Puget Sound and the base of the Olympic Mountains, rests Silver City. This Urban-Suburban experience is a sweet brewer's mash of Seattle city life and breathtaking outdoor adventure, all within ones reach. Beer, well made, brings the people of the \"Silver City\" together in celebration of having it all.\r\n\r\nSilver City was started in 1996 by Co-owners Steve & Scott Houmes, and it remains a locally owned and operated business. Silver City Brewery's handcrafted beers are available on draft, in 22oz bottles, 12oz bottle & 12oz can 6-packs across Washington State in bars, restaurants, and grocery stores.\r\n\r\nSilver City Brewery's production facility & brewery taproom is located at 206 Katy Penman Ave. in Bremerton, WA. Silver City Restaurant is located in Silverdale at 2799 NW Myhre Rd.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.","website":"http:\/\/silvercity.beer","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:44:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LCKMU86SX5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"XDsUGb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2799 NW Myhre Road","locality":"Silverdale","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98383","phone":"360-698-5879","website":"http:\/\/www.silvercitybrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":47.659282,"longitude":-122.687358,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2017-06-12 18:32:03","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IgNzA4","name":"Brewery & Taproom","streetAddress":"206 Katy Penman Ave","locality":"Bremerton","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98312","phone":"360-813-1487","website":"http:\/\/silvercity.beer","latitude":47.5615696,"longitude":-122.6780062,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-12 18:32:01","updateDate":"2018-06-19 19:52:35","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bS13Ei","name":"Big Deluxe","nameDisplay":"Big Deluxe","description":"This unique beer features a massive wall of flavor and is so dark it actually absorbs light \u2013 at least we think it does!

Spalt Select was reportedly chosen by Anheuser-Busch to replace Spalt Spalter and Tettnang Tettnanger hops in some of their recipes. Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau.

The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

We brewed Big Falcon Deal with a hearty and inspired grain bill of Vienna malt, special aromatic, victory and oats to provide a complex and well rounded malt profile. We then bittered this ale with Columbus hops, provided some flavor with Cascade and then loaded the last 10 minutes of the boil with the Falconer's Flight hop blend. Falconer's Flight was also added post fermentation with a little bit of Centennial to showcase the hop's aroma.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"47.1","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PtfFW9\/upload_BEllsr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PtfFW9\/upload_BEllsr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PtfFW9\/upload_BEllsr-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PtfFW9\/upload_BEllsr-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PtfFW9\/upload_BEllsr-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PtfFW9\/upload_BEllsr-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.054","createDate":"2012-04-15 19:26:28","updateDate":"2015-12-16 16:54:20","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century.

Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"ZrWVsJ","name":"Flat Tail Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Flat Tail","description":"Started in 2010 in Corvallis, OR, home of the Oregon State Beavers, Flat Tail Brewing started with a small 6 barrel system. 4 years later Brewer\/Owner Dave Marliave is creating some of the best beers in Oregon.
