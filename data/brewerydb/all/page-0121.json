In May 2006 the Baltika #3 was produced in an innovative package: a premium 1 liter PET-package that looks practically the same as the half-liter glass bottle. In 2007 the Baltika #3 bottle received an embossed lettering. At the same time the brand was produced in a one-liter aluminum can that was new for the market. In April 2008 a 1.5-liter PET bottle with a \"football\" design was produced for the Baltika #3, especially for the Russian Football Championship. The PET-glass material has high protective qualities and keeps the most popular Russian beer fresh for a longer period.\r\n\r\nDue to the high demand the production of this popular brand keeps growing. By the results of the 2008, the volume of sales amounted +7,5% (Business Analytica) , which allows the brand to remain a certain leader in the medium-price segment. The highest distribution level of Baltika Company for food products (98%) makes the Baltika \u21163 available for buyers all over the country.\r\n\r\nToday the Classic beer is exported to over 40 countries around the world, including Germany, Japan, Great Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, France, and Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor ten years running the Baltika #3 Classic has received the prestigious Russian \"Commodity of the Year\" prize in the field of consumer goods. The prize is awarded to the most popular mass consumption products available in the assortment of retail shops. Since the time the prize was established the Baltika #3 Classic has been the unconditional leader in the \"beer\" category.\r\n\r\nThis beer brand is also annually declared \"The Most People\u2019s Brand\" by the results of tasting at the Moscow Beer Festival, the largest beer festival in Russia. In 2008 the Baltika #3 won a silver medal at the Superior Taste Award contest in Brussels established by the International Taste and Quality Institute.

Baltika \u21164 is a dark drink produced with rye malt, which adds bread flavor and light bitterness to the taste. The Original sort is now steadily popular and has dedicated lovers throughout Russia.\r\nBaltika #4 is traditionally produced only at St. Petersburg brewery. From this place it is taken all over Russia and exported to almost 30 countries of the world.\r\n\r\nBaltika #4 has won a number of top prizes of international professional contests. In September 2004 Baltika #4 was among the 50 top brands of the world by the results of the annual International Beer Challenge Contest. All the brands participating in the contest are divided into 12 classes and are strictly assessed by their flavor and package by the leading experts in brewing. The jury includes both consumers and specialists in marketing and packaging.\r\n\r\nTwo times running, in 2007 and 2008, Baltika #4 won the silver medals of the Australian International Beer Awards Contest in the category of Lager Packaged.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Baltika #4 Original brought the Company the Gold Medal of the European Beer Star Awards Contest in the category of Red and Amber Beer. This is the top award of one of the most prestigious contests of the world brewing. The contest was organized by the Association of Private Breweries of Germany and the Association of Independent Breweries of Europe.

Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:33:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QUG9N370X2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lAcrbq","name":"Gadsden","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-5:00pm-9:00pm,thu-5:00pm-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-5:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"heKnGb","name":"Birmingham","streetAddress":"3201 1st Avenue North","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"(205) 407-8025","website":"https:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/birmingham","latitude":33.5221355,"longitude":-86.7882994,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2018-10-14 19:57:28","updateDate":"2019-10-10 13:05:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-3:00pm-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YZWDeE","name":"Bamarillo","nameDisplay":"Bamarillo","description":"This beer is an Amarillo-hopped saison brewed with pineapple.\r\n\r\nBamarillo uses the same grist bill as Bam Bi\u00e8re, but with half the amount of Crystal and Cascade hops.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"pzWq1r","name":"Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Jolly Pumpkin","description":"Welcome to a land of open fermentation, oak barrel aging, and bottle conditioning.

This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness. Certain renditions of this beer style approach a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":4.1,"betaAcidMin":4.7,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":55.1,"humuleneMax":55.1,"caryophylleneMin":14.5,"caryophylleneMax":14.6,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":26,"myrceneMin":15.5,"myrceneMax":17.5,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":0.1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:31","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"yeast":[{"id":1893,"name":"Munich Lager","description":"This is a unique strain, capable of producing fine lagers.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put up\" a dozen people from \"the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town.
