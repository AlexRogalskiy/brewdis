In my dreams, let me my true love see.\u201d\r\n\r\nCopper in colour, St. Luke\u2019s Verse Gruit Ale offers up an aromatic herb-and-spice bouquet of lavender accented by thyme and rosemary. This is a flavourful, balanced beer that is highly nuanced but very approachable. Gruits are beers made with herbs, spices and other botanicals, and St. Luke\u2019s Verse was first brewed in 2014 for International Gruit Day Feb. 1.\r\nHistory & Style\r\n\r\nCenturies ago it would have seemed odd to consider using only one herb to spice beer. Dozens of plants, such as bog myrtle, yarrow, heather, and juniper were commonly used in ancient brewing. These beers were known as Gruit or Grut (German for herb), and a brewers\u2019 spice blend was a proprietary and carefully guarded secret. After the Reinheitsgebot (Bavarian Purity Act of 1516) ordered that only hops be used to spice beer, the Bavarian style of brewing took hold in most of Europe, and the gruit gradually faded into obscurity. Luckily, some craft breweries have rediscovered this ancient form of brewing. Craft brewing is all about discovery and experimentation, and gruits are one of the best examples of this pioneering spirit!","abv":"5.7","ibu":"11","availableId":2,"styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bBXCpz\/upload_rSPUG8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bBXCpz\/upload_rSPUG8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bBXCpz\/upload_rSPUG8-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bBXCpz\/upload_rSPUG8-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bBXCpz\/upload_rSPUG8-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/bBXCpz\/upload_rSPUG8-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Soft cheeses like fresh mozzarella, ricotta & mascarpone; herbed chicken stew; Alsatian-style tarte flamb\u00e9 (bacon, caramelized onions, thyme & fresh cheese)","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.056","createDate":"2015-03-01 19:38:45","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:20:18","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....","website":"http:\/\/www.easternshorebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:21:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7NU39JD4ZQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wW6rQJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"605 S.

Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....","website":"http:\/\/www.easternshorebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:21:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7NU39JD4ZQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wW6rQJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"605 S.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze. Competition organizers may wish to subcategorize this style into rice and corn subcategories.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:40:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"D1UQzj","name":"Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Rock Bottom Restaurant","description":"Our brewers eat, drink and sleep beer.

Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.
