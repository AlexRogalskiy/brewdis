Well, let us explain\u2026as many of you know Butler is the birthplace of the \u201cjeep\u201d vehicle. What many of you may not know is that the first \u201cjeep\u201d prototype was called the Bantam Reconnaissance Car (BRC). We want to capture the essence of Butler in everything we do and what better way than to have our name be a tribute to such an important part of our history. So there you have it, Butler is the birthplace of the Bantam Reconnaissance Car and now, Recon Brewing.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nRecon Brewing was established in February 2016 by 3 friends, all born and raised in Butler that met through the fire service in Butler Township. Toby Wehr, Dave Bestwick, and Nate Bacher set out on a mission to start a brewery that would focus on high quality, yet simple beers that will become known for their drinkability and value. We searched the area far and wide for a suitable location that would set the perfect stage for the type of brewery that we envisioned. We are now happy to say that we found the perfect home on N. Main St Ext in Center Twp. With a combined volunteer history of over 70 years of service, we have dedicated our lives to volunteering and working for our community and we strive to continue to give back to the Butler area.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nOur \u201cdrink local\u201d mentality means more to us than just our beer and has led us to seek locally for materials, supplies, equipment, and even design. Our logo and artwork has been designed by Butler native artist, and long-time friend, Jack Laughner and our custom brewing equipment will be manufactured only an hour away.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nOur dream is that Recon Brewing is a relaxed atmosphere that invites all walks of life to come spend their day or evening with us and share a pint. It is a dream in the process of becoming a reality. \r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n#OnAMission","website":"https:\/\/www.reconbrewing.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VeXCZR\/upload_fTtHZM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VeXCZR\/upload_fTtHZM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VeXCZR\/upload_fTtHZM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VeXCZR\/upload_fTtHZM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VeXCZR\/upload_fTtHZM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:59:22","updateDate":"2019-08-13 14:08:57","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0ARH4TK93U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9fw3hJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1747 North Main Street Extension","locality":"Butler","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"16001","phone":"(724) 256-8747","website":"https:\/\/www.reconbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 3:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 7:00 PM","latitude":40.9083082,"longitude":-79.9255227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:59:24","updateDate":"2018-08-17 18:59:24","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 3:00 \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 11:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 7:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nL6v4Y","name":"Azrael","nameDisplay":"Azrael","description":"Gold in color, medium in body, with hints of apple and pear from the unique Belgian yeast strain used.

Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"pHs1Yo","name":"River North Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"River North","description":"Independent family-owned Denver brewery crafting Adventure Fuel for the state of Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/www.rivernorthbrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/pHs1Yo\/upload_PfwOJC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-08 21:12:33","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:05:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"CG6TLSE8DO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"9pFgAc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2401 Blake St #1","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80205","phone":"303.296.2617","latitude":39.7586165,"longitude":-104.9892608,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-07-08 21:13:45","updateDate":"2016-10-07 00:16:27","forwardingId":"R0qhwx","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"R0qhwx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6021 Washington St","extendedAddress":"Unit A.","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80216","phone":"(303) 296-2617","website":"http:\/\/www.rivernorthbrewery.com\/","latitude":39.8065586,"longitude":-104.9790984,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-02 23:08:33","updateDate":"2016-10-07 00:16:13","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"H6V3eM","name":"B-1000 Terminator","nameDisplay":"B-1000 Terminator","description":"Celebrating our 1000th brew at the Market Garden Brewpub on W. 25th St., Market Garden Brewery releases B-1000 Terminator, a rich and roasted Barrel Aged Imperial Stout accented with dark fruit and caramel notes.
