On the hoppy side, we particularly like showcasing the intensely tropical, citrusy, and earthy-green aromas and flavors of newer varieties from the Pacific Northwest and the Southern Hemisphere. We also like experimenting with Belgian yeast \u2013 the floral, fruity bouquet and soft, peppery spice created during fermentation make Belgian ales truly unique, and are often the best styles to pair with food. AND they make excellent barrel-aging candidates, some of which can be seen on display in the brewpub.","website":"http:\/\/www.alvaradostreetbrewery.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g2d9B7\/upload_4m0QrV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g2d9B7\/upload_4m0QrV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g2d9B7\/upload_4m0QrV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g2d9B7\/upload_4m0QrV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/g2d9B7\/upload_4m0QrV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-16 23:34:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:55:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"O0VFZDMIXE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"alL5xh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"426 Alvarado St","locality":"Monterey","region":"California","postalCode":"93940","phone":"(831) 655-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.alvaradostreetbrewery.com","latitude":36.5993041,"longitude":-121.8948251,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-16 23:34:59","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:16:19","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UK09Tp","name":"Countdown Honey Brown","nameDisplay":"Countdown Honey Brown","description":"This medium bodied honey brown ale was originally brewed in celebration of the new millenium.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.

We were busy creating the same kind of crisp,refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment.

If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"CwxOMu","name":"Odd Side Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Odd Side","description":"\u200bWelcome to Odd Side Ales, one of the fastest growing breweries in Michigan.
