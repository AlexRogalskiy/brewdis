These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"}},{"id":"J2jo0g","name":"Little Bagpipe","nameDisplay":"Little Bagpipe","abv":"6.2","ibu":"24.2","availableId":1,"styleId":9,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/J2jo0g\/upload_k3zml7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/J2jo0g\/upload_k3zml7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/J2jo0g\/upload_k3zml7-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/J2jo0g\/upload_k3zml7-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/J2jo0g\/upload_k3zml7-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/J2jo0g\/upload_k3zml7-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-19 18:55:48","updateDate":"2017-01-24 19:26:20","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":9,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Export Ale","shortName":"Scottish Export","description":"The overriding character of Scottish export ale is sweet, caramel-like, and malty.

Then the term \"Session\" became a scarlet letter to a beer making sure no one would drop cash on the bar top for a pint of low ABV hop magic. In our constant attempt to brew beers that nobody will buy, we decided to combine the aforementioned styles and terms to create a Session India Pale Lager: Little Galaxy. Our third child in the Galaxy single-hop series of beers, Little Galaxy is part American Light Lager and part Session IPA. A clean and simple grain bill of Barley and Rice is mashed at a high temperature to retain a heavier body than your typical Light Lager to support an IPA amount of high alpha Galaxy hops from Australia. Fermented with our house Lager strain, we develop an extremely clean ester profile that flees from the giant hop aroma of fresh picked apricots and pineapple. Left un-fined and hazy, this Session IPL brings all of the refreshment and bright nature of a traditional domestic Lager with all of the hop juice you want in an IPA. The perfect beer for a heat wave, Little Galaxy Session IPL can be crushed with reckless abandon regardless of the season.","abv":"4","styleId":108,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-04 13:39:45","updateDate":"2017-10-04 13:39:45","style":{"id":108,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Session Beer","shortName":"Session","description":"Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines.
