Oktoberfest is malty and crisp, but not sweet, with a smooth, balanced finish and understated hops.\r\n\r\nWe first crafted this beer to celebrate Oktoberfest at the Delaware Saengerbund. This annual German festival brings the spirit of Munich to Delaware with Bavarian bands, German food and folk dancing. Twin Lakes Oktoberfest blends the traditions of German brewing with the innovative American spirit.","abv":"6","ibu":"30","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gmfbj6\/upload_6Qq4kT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gmfbj6\/upload_6Qq4kT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gmfbj6\/upload_6Qq4kT-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gmfbj6\/upload_6Qq4kT-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gmfbj6\/upload_6Qq4kT-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gmfbj6\/upload_6Qq4kT-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:50","updateDate":"2015-12-16 06:46:08","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.

It tends to be less sweet with a more assertive hop character. That is not to say that Vienna Lager is a hoppy beer - it's not - but it is a balanced beer. And if you know us at all, you know we LOVE balanced beer. It's also slightly less alcoholic than Maerzen, coming in at around 5.5%. \r\n\r\nIt's hard to find good quality Vienna Lager these days, but the one country that has embraced the style the most is Mexico. We think it has to do with either Maximilian I, another Viennese Austrian who just happened to be emperor of Mexico, or The Most Interesting Man in the World. But that's a lesson for another day.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"27","styleId":102,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-31 20:58:12","updateDate":"2016-08-31 20:58:12","style":{"id":102,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style M\u00e4rzen \/ Oktoberfest","shortName":"American Oktoberfest","description":"The American style of these classic German beers is distinguished by a comparatively greater degree of hop character.
