Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

The farm is a historic site, dating back to the Civil War, and is officially known as \u201cThe Encampment\u201d as the farm was used as a camp for Union soldiers leading up to the battle of Antietam.\r\nFollowing the Civil War, a fire destroyed most of the farmhouse. It was rebuilt in the 1890\u2019s on its original foundation. Today, the farmhouse, adjacent carriage house, and Civil War-era barn foundation still stand on the property. Additional buildings, such as the cider house and barns, were added later, designed to maintain the historic appearance and integrity of the property and surrounding area.\r\nRob Miller, his wife, Patty Power, and their three children moved to the farm in 2001. Prior to the Millers, the farm had never been used as an apple orchard. However, having always been cider fans (both fresh and hard cider) and with the farm located in a prime region to grow apples, they decided to enter the cider-making world.\r\nThe operation has been a family-affair from the beginning: fifteen of the Millers\u2019 extended family came to plant the initial 1,000 trees one weekend in the spring of 2001. By 2006, the trees were producing enough fruit to make the first batches of fresh cider. At this point, construction on the cider house commenced.\r\nBy 2008, the cider house was officially completed and approved to be open for business. During this time, numerous home-brew cider-makers discovered the farm and would buy fresh cider to take home and ferment into hard cider. Tim Rose, one of the home-brewers, had come back several times with refreshing cider and well-researched advice for the Millers\u2019 cider making. Tim was invited to join the family-owned and operated farm as the official cidermaker for Distillery Lane Ciderwork. He has since moved from carboys in his basement to his own building with stainless steel tanks!\r\nOpened for business as an official Maryland winery in 2010, Distillery Lane Ciderworks took its name from the rich history of the area. The whole valley was dotted with beer and whiskey-producing distilleries up until Prohibition. The remains of one of these distilleries can still be seen today down the road from the farm in the woods.\r\nDistillery Lane Ciderworks was the first licensed cidery in Maryland. More trees have been planted since 2001 and the orchard is now nine acres (over 3,000 trees)!\r\nSince 2010, the business has been featured in articles in media outlets such as The Washington Post and on the hit television show, \u201cDrinking Made Easy,\u201d where the host, Zane Lamprey, and his stuffed monkey, Pleepleus, visited the farm and tasted some of the cider.

Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character.

The Witchshark is shy and mischievous, but once you let him into your heart you\u2019ll see why this intense brew is a favourite among our patrons and brewers.","abv":"9","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w56HpC\/upload_o4zuJQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w56HpC\/upload_o4zuJQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w56HpC\/upload_o4zuJQ-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w56HpC\/upload_o4zuJQ-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w56HpC\/upload_o4zuJQ-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/w56HpC\/upload_o4zuJQ-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-12 19:54:18","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:57:31","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Boa6td","name":"Perrin Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Perrin","description":"Located 10 minutes north of downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan, our micro brewery and taproom is striving to bring a world class experience to every person who walks through our doors.\r\n\r\nWith a hospitality philosophy of treating our customers like they're guests in our home, we look forward to serving you.","website":"http:\/\/www.perrinbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","mailingListUrl":"connor@perrinbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Boa6td\/upload_6ADB1F-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 11:40:02","updateDate":"2019-10-11 21:14:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CRE5z9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5910 Comstock Park Drive","locality":"Comstock Park","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49321","phone":"(616) 551-1957","website":"http:\/\/www.perrinbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.0710876,"longitude":-85.6814504,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 11:41:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:28:50","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-11:00am-11:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00pm,sun-12:00pm-8:00pm,wed-4:00pm-11:00pm,thu-4:00pm-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HYTCkt","name":"With Love From Grimm","nameDisplay":"With Love From Grimm","abv":"9","glasswareId":8,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HYTCkt\/upload_GEnz31-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HYTCkt\/upload_GEnz31-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HYTCkt\/upload_GEnz31-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HYTCkt\/upload_GEnz31-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HYTCkt\/upload_GEnz31-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HYTCkt\/upload_GEnz31-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2013-12-13 14:05:26","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:10:35","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"AT5UIb","name":"D9 Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"D9","description":"A craft microbrewery with the purpose of brewing and sharing outstanding beer that unites people.
