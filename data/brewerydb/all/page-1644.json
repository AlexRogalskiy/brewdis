There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"8iY0UW","name":"Brewery Ferment","nameShortDisplay":"Brewery Ferment","description":"Ferment is an inviting, casual, neighborhood brewery that is truly all about the beer.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"ETtkIW","name":"Bluejacket","nameShortDisplay":"Bluejacket","description":"Brewery and Tavern in SE Washington, DC.","website":"http:\/\/www.bluejacketdc.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/neighborhoodrestaurantgroup.us2.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=d879a39f766b935628a8d1295&id=eb7332cb6d","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-16 16:09:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:30:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RWU1S5KY70","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"YhxPMZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"300 Tingey St SE","locality":"Washington","region":"District of Columbia","postalCode":"20003","phone":"(202) 524-4862","website":"http:\/\/www.bluejacketdc.com\/","latitude":38.875171,"longitude":-77.001023,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-16 16:10:07","updateDate":"2015-03-03 17:28:23","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"YJcaRH","name":"Intangible Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Intangible Ales","description":"Brewer of eclectic, rustic and wild ales based in South Central Pennsylvania.\r\nIntangible Ales is a new project combining Terry Hawbaker's passion for brewing and Kristen Mullen's passion for photography (Watch for Kristen\u2019s cool label art!)

It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"78PXl9","name":"Treacle Treat","nameDisplay":"Treacle Treat","description":"Wadworth new seasonal ale Treacle Treat is  ghoulishly good.

Golding hops.","abv":"8.6","ibu":"24","availableId":4,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/okPGK2\/upload_BBj3Bv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/okPGK2\/upload_BBj3Bv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/okPGK2\/upload_BBj3Bv-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/okPGK2\/upload_BBj3Bv-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/okPGK2\/upload_BBj3Bv-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/okPGK2\/upload_BBj3Bv-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-05 00:36:31","updateDate":"2018-06-26 01:39:39","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"iYAf2b","name":"Flathead Lake Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Flathead Lake","description":"Flathead Lake Brewing Co. is all about handcrafted and award-winning beers, brewed in Bigfork, MT using local ingredients and glacial water. Our flagship beers include The Centennial IPA, Citrus SMaSH IPA, Bluff Charge Oatmeal Pale, Swimmer\u2019s Itch Saison, and Moonlight Paddle Kettle Sour. We also have a rotating selection of seasonal brews. Visit our Pubhouse in Bigfork for a fresh, locally farmed, seasonal menu featuring daily specials and a wide range of food entrees such as in-house smoked meats, seafood, our famous clam chowder, and homemade desserts.\r\n\r\nThe Flathead Lake Brewing Company started in 2004 in Woods Bay, Montana. Our owner Greg Johnston has two very specific goals. The first: to make the best beer ever. The second: to have fun doing it. Naming the brewery wasn\u2019t hard. FLBC overlooks the shores of the largest freshwater lake in the West \u2013 and we would argue the most beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 we were honored with becoming the youngest brewery ever to win not just one, but two, World Beer Cup awards. Our brewery brought home a Bronze medal for our Peg Leg Porter and a Silver medal for our Mutiny Stout.\r\n\r\nWe at FLBC work hard, play harder, and do everything to the highest standard. For us, it\u2019s about being leaders in the beer industry, it\u2019s about supporting local and environmental sustainability, and it\u2019s about contributing to the community that has so graciously embraced us. Most importantly for our crew, it\u2019s about making beer and food that we are proud of. We love what we do, and we hope you do too.\r\n\r\nMontana is the Treasure State, and we are Montana\u2019s Liquid Treasure.","website":"http:\/\/www.flatheadlakebrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iYAf2b\/upload_2trUlC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:05:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8NJ793DXHU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CHRyRk","name":"Woods Bay","streetAddress":"26008 East Lake Shore Rte.","locality":"Bigfork","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59911","phone":"406-837-0353","website":"http:\/\/www.flatheadlakebrewing.com\/","latitude":47.998205,"longitude":-114.045602,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-06-04 18:45:20","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XF4JJ4","name":"Missoula","streetAddress":"424 North Higgins","locality":"Missoula","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59802","phone":"406-542-3847","website":"http:\/\/www.flbcofmissoula.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Friday    3:00 to 12:00 \r\nSaturday 11:00 to 12:00 \r\nSunday 11:00 to 10:00","latitude":46.873384,"longitude":-113.99322,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-15 21:34:43","updateDate":"2015-06-05 16:11:31","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Friday    3:00 to 12:00 \r\nSaturday 11:00 to 12:00 \r\nSunday 11:00 to 10:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"3JNh3v","name":"FLBC Pubhouse","streetAddress":"116 Holt Dr.","locality":"Bigfork","region":"Montana","postalCode":"59911","phone":"4068370085","latitude":48.0642939,"longitude":-114.083249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-04 18:35:45","updateDate":"2015-06-05 16:11:31","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XVQRa7","name":"Treblehook","nameDisplay":"Treblehook","description":"Treblehook is vigorously hopped and patiently aged with aromatic malt and spicy hop notes.
