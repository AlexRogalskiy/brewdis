There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Navnet stammer fra Urban-bryggeriet i Aalborg, hvor brygmesteren fra Thisted Bryghus i slutningen af 70\u00e9rne \u201dslog sine folder\u201d. Her fik han f\u00f8rste gang \u201dsmag\u201d for provinslivet og denne s\u00e6rlige \u00f8ltype, som ofte i Thisted-regi betegnes som \u00f8llets gentleman. Navnet k\u00f8btes efter Urban-bryggeriets lukning i 1986. Limfjords-Porteren \u201dkredsede\u201d brygmesteren om frem til 1997, hvorefter han ikke mente l\u00e6ngere at kunne forbedre produktet. Den rette blanding af maltene var opn\u00e5et. Af us\u00e6dvanlige ingredienser skal n\u00e6vnes r\u00f8gmalt og engelsk lakrids, der tilsammen giver en smagsm\u00e6ssig balance p\u00e5 et lidt h\u00f8jere niveau end det s\u00e6dvanligvis ses. Brygmesterens personlige favorit og \u201dhjertebarn\u201d.","abv":"7.9","styleId":104,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-28 20:21:59","updateDate":"2017-01-10 21:43:48","style":{"id":104,"categoryId":9,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Other Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Baltic-Style Porter","shortName":"Baltic Porter","description":"A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma.
