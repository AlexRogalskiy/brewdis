This idyllic swimming hole is the first place Doobie, the chocolate brewery labrador, learned how to swim. This Ale is our take on a classic Belgian Wit. To make this Wit unique, we add un-malted wheat, rolled oats, two varieties of classic European hops, chamomile, curacao orange peel, coriander, grains of paradise, and a rare yeast strain from the Old Country. This is a beer that can be enjoyed year-round, whether on the slopes on a beautiful bluebird day, or lazily fly fishing in Lava Lake.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"15","glasswareId":5,"srmId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/frtS8I\/upload_4KX75a-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/frtS8I\/upload_4KX75a-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/frtS8I\/upload_4KX75a-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/frtS8I\/upload_4KX75a-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/frtS8I\/upload_4KX75a-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/frtS8I\/upload_4KX75a-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Marscarpone cheese, steamed mussels, panna cotta","originalGravity":"1.048","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:36","updateDate":"2016-07-05 18:44:33","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"}},{"id":"yOAdmq","name":"Lava Love Hazy IPA","nameDisplay":"Lava Love Hazy IPA","description":"Voggy and hazy India Pale Ale brewed with Mosaic, Citra, and Denali hops, and fermented with London III and Sacc Brux Trios.\r\n\r\nAppearance: Opaque, hazy, pale golden\r\n\r\nAroma: Tangerine, mango, pineapple, pine\r\n\r\nFlavor: Soft tropical fruit, citrus and piney with moderate bitterness","abv":"6.5","ibu":"50","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yOAdmq\/upload_fZrmDl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yOAdmq\/upload_fZrmDl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yOAdmq\/upload_fZrmDl-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yOAdmq\/upload_fZrmDl-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yOAdmq\/upload_fZrmDl-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yOAdmq\/upload_fZrmDl-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-01 20:15:33","updateDate":"2018-07-01 20:16:24","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
