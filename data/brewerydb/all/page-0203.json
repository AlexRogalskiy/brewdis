Before he knew it, Julian Hard Cider's fresh-pressed hard cider was in great demand not just in our little mountain town, but nationwide!  Paul immediately began working hard to open a local pressing facility, but for various reasons (county zoning limitations, lack of water \/ drought, unavailable or unusable land) and the determination to only make fresh-pressed hard cider, he partnered with his friend Andrew Brown and their amazing sustainable orchards in Oregon.  \r\n\r\nAnd now finally, after more than seven years of searching and working with the County, Julian Hard Cider is coming home!

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jwh6wU","name":"Black & Cram","nameDisplay":"Black & Cram","abv":"9","ibu":"54","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-07 01:20:55","updateDate":"2015-12-08 19:21:20","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"yyXPEU","name":"Side Project Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Side Project","description":"A 100% barrel-aged, mostly barrel fermented, gypsy brewing project.","website":"http:\/\/sideprojectbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/yyXPEU\/upload_UFXbuL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-26 17:14:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:51:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"E5JN6IWK1C","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ymbt9C","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7458 Manchester Rd","locality":"Maplewood","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63143","website":"http:\/\/www.sideprojectbrewing.com","latitude":38.61188,"longitude":-90.321888,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-27 01:21:32","updateDate":"2017-12-11 18:41:56","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"TYlrtN","name":"Side Project Cellar","streetAddress":"7373 Marietta Ave","locality":"Maplewood","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63143","phone":"(314) 224-5211","website":"http:\/\/www.sideprojectbrewing.com\/tasting-room\/","latitude":38.611977,"longitude":-90.3198394,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-21 13:54:27","updateDate":"2015-07-21 13:54:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-3:00pm-10:00pm,wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-1:00pm-11:00pm,sat-1:00pm-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3Ncd5r","name":"Black '47","nameDisplay":"Black '47","description":"Irish Oatmeal Porter\/Stout \r\n\r\nEasy drinking, medium bodied, notes of coffee and chocolate.","abv":"6.7","styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-17 00:47:09","updateDate":"2015-06-17 14:29:06","style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"oDJkQb","name":"Buckbean Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Buckbean","description":"Buckbean Brewing Company \u2014 the first package brewery in Western Nevada and the second of three in the Silver State \u2014 began operations in a new 7,600-square-foot facility in Reno, NV in April 2008.

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-03-14 13:33:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YmEulj","name":"Black Ale","nameDisplay":"Black Ale","description":"Potosi Black Ale is technically a German style ALT beer that has the body of a golden ale but with a bit more bitterness derived from Cascade hops.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"https:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:25:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TN7GC9UK6M","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JlQ32z","name":"Black Ale","nameDisplay":"Black Ale (2012)","description":"Thousands of years ago the ancient Mayans of Central America developed a \"Long-Count\" round calendar that ends ominously on December 21, 2012.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"y4ip96","name":"High Water Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"High Water","description":"Leveraging his successful 15 year brewing career, Brewmaster Steve Altimari is proud to enter his fifth year at the helm of High Water Brewing. \"High Water\" being a playful interpretation of Steve's last name.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.
