With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:04:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0K4BFPNY1I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RjDYhl","name":"BA Wee Heavy","nameDisplay":"BA Wee Heavy","description":"This Barrel-Aged version of our Scotch-Style ale is matured in premium bourbon barrels for up to one year to add layers of complexity to its rich, malty flavor profile.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"TqC06u","name":"Anthem Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Anthem","description":"Anthem Brewing Company strives to create World Class beers that blur the line between the Old World and the New.

Fast friends and freshman roommates, they came up together during their years at UNH.  After graduation each wished the other well and split for separate coasts. Dane crossed the country, landing in San Francisco, where a hobby born from homebrewing with his father compelled him to volunteer at Magnolia Gastropub & Brewery in the Bay Area's famed Haight-Ashbury. It was at Magnolia that Dane first got drunk on beer. Well, wait, not intoxicated drunk, though, obviously one can assume, but drunk as in impassioned. He became impassioned to turn a hobby into a life\u2019s discipline. In the years to follow, Dane would become a brewer at the international brewery Trumer, lead brewer at Magnolia, and in 2015, upon returning to the Seacoast, brewer at Smuttynose.\r\n\r\nDuring that time Dagan spent his days laying roots in Portsmouth. Although, he\u2019s worked in restaurants since fourteen, it was Dane who got him his first gig in the downtown area, bussing tables on the decks. Despite his brief flirtation with advertising, Dagan never fully wrenched himself from behind the bar. What began as bussing, turned to bartending, turned to the acting General Manager at the Franklin Oyster House. And over that time his reverence for the bar has grown as deep as stout.\r\n\r\nNowadays the two are down in the trenches at the official Liars' Bench, sledgehammering concrete and pouring it. Dane is eager to brew, Dagan is eager to pour, and both are eagerly awaiting the not so distant date when the doors open and it all really begins.","website":"http:\/\/www.liarsbenchbeer.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-09 16:09:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:43:33","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H6A0BGIYVJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"azeG7v","name":"Liar's Bench Beer Co.","streetAddress":"459 Islington Street #4","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","website":"http:\/\/www.liarsbenchbeer.com","latitude":43.0722885,"longitude":-70.7685789,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-09 16:10:42","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:07:59","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-12:00pm-8:00pm,thu-12:00pm-8:00pm,fri-12:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6l3a1t","name":"Babble to the Nag","nameDisplay":"Babble to the Nag","abv":"6.8","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-09 16:00:05","updateDate":"2016-03-09 16:00:05","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America\u2019s taps ran dry.\r\n\r\nThe brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco\u2019s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy\u2019s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery\u2019s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Tap Room opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery\u2019s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery\u2019s original fifteen barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.   \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Speakeasy beer brands and brewing equipment were acquired by Hunters Point Brewery, a company founded by former beverage distributor, Ces Butner. Under new ownership Speakeasy Ales & Lagers will grow by leaps and bounds.

The second we settle, the second we say that a beer has been taken as far as it can go, we start losing. The proverbial mountaintop exists only in our minds. Always be climbing, always be pushing forward.\r\n\r\nThe next, and equally important commitment, is to the process. There is serenity to be found in even the most menial, repetitive task. There are always ways to improve yourself and your methods, hiding just below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe parties, jokes, and fun we seem to be having? We have created our own world in which to reside, and we love sharing it with all those that want to partake. I promise you, there is no greater joy, professionally.\r\n\r\nThe painfully fleeting span of the human life is much too short and precious to spend it being anything less than the best you can possibly be in your chosen vocation. We love the work we do, for its own sake. We spend every day trying to get better, and we treat the opportunity to give this beer to the people of Maine every week as the gift that it is.\r\n\r\nThank you for drinking.","website":"http:\/\/www.bissellbrothers.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TEG3J9\/upload_nBbTz7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TEG3J9\/upload_nBbTz7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TEG3J9\/upload_nBbTz7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TEG3J9\/upload_nBbTz7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/TEG3J9\/upload_nBbTz7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-25 20:00:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:07:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"V739Z2RDPK","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"rDrEhT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4 Thompsons Point #108","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04102","phone":"(207) 423-3622","website":"http:\/\/www.bissellbrothers.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nFri:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nSat:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nWednesday - Saturday 12-6Pm","latitude":43.6519828,"longitude":-70.2918357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-28 12:14:49","updateDate":"2016-08-22 12:47:35","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nFri:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\r\nSat:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\r\n\r\nWednesday - Saturday 12-6Pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
