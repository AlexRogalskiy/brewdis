A \u201cpippin\u201d is an apple tree that grew from an errant seed (unlike most apple trees, which are propagated by grafting). Pippins cider reflects the story of how apple varieties developed during North America\u2019s pioneering age, when many of the Old World varieties failed to thrive, but their seeds produced a generation of new varieties. The Yellow Newton Pippin is one such apple, and the main varietal in Sea Cider\u2019s Pippins. This apple is high in both acid and sugar (important features in traditional North American cider varieties).  Pippins cider is made in the New England pre-Prohibition style, which means sharply acidic, but balanced with subtle sweetness, and high in alcohol thanks to chapitalization. Fermentation is undertaken at cool temperatures to preserve fruity aromas and to maintain the acidity. A dosage of organic cane sugar is added during fermentation to raise the level of alcohol (this was traditionally important to improve the shelf life of cider during the pioneering days).\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:\r\nAppearance: Effervescent, warm straw in colour, clear, bright.\r\nAromas, flavours: Citrus, apple, pear, lemongrass, pineapple, confectionary.\r\nAcid\/sweetness: Intense acidity, balanced by slight residual sweetness.\r\nMouthfeel: Crisp, sharp to the tongue.","abv":"9.5","styleId":154,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Truth be told, Pippins pairs well with pretty much everything!

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.
