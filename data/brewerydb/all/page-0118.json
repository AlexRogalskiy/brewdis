The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

Our name is a fusion of 'brewery' with our family name, Rue.\r\n\r\nOur calling is to create beers with character and depth using the simplest and purest of means. We do not filter or pasteurize our beers. Most of our bottled beers gain carbonation through bottle conditioning, allowing carbonation to naturally occur through a secondary bottle fermentation. We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PD1LOINQV7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4amUPc","name":"Bakke Hill Black Lager","nameDisplay":"Bakke Hill Black Lager","description":"Bakke Hill Black Lager has an opaque, black color and a full, chocolaty or coffee flavor with a hint of vanilla.

After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.\r\n \r\nWe host 3 annual events, The Virginia Herb Festival (June), BRB Hop Harvest Party (August) and BRB Holiday Market (November). \r\n \r\nYou are cordially invited to come and drink our beer, eat, play and spend some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.backroombreweryva.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:40:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EZKWH4V13N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"CEon99","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Ridgemont Rd.","locality":"Middletown","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22645","phone":"540-869-8482","latitude":38.9956004,"longitude":-78.2210269,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:28:31","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NBjiVH","name":"Balashi","nameDisplay":"Balashi","description":"The beer has a deep golden color totally clear and transparent, with a bitterness which is soft to the tongue and nose however with an aroma of fresh hops, a short aftertaste and easy on foam.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few.
