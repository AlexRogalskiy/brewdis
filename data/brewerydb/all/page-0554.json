This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"9TY2Xv","name":"Bullfrog Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Bullfrog","description":"The Bullfrog Brewery, located in downtown Williamsport, Pa, is an award-winning microbrewery \/ restaurant and has quickly grown into one of the largest attractions in Northcentral Pennsylvania.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"laNl6e","name":"Grimm Artisanal Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Grimm Artisanal Ales","description":"Our beers are artisanal and often Belgian-inspired.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"osLNb3","name":"Pizza Boy Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Pizza Boy","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaboybrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/osLNb3\/upload_aXnmYi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 18:39:41","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:16:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYVNK0BFWM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QBZAUO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2240 Millenium Way","locality":"Enola","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17025","phone":"717-728-3840","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaboybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Wed 11 am - 10 pm\r\nThurs - Sat 11 am - 11 pm","latitude":40.2887287,"longitude":-76.9698583,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 18:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Wed 11 am - 10 pm\r\nThurs - Sat 11 am - 11 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CD6byk","name":"Eternal Youth Bi\u00e8re d\u2019Abricot","nameDisplay":"Eternal Youth Bi\u00e8re d\u2019Abricot","description":"In search of healing waters and gold, 16th century Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon traveled to what is now Florida.

An ale which exhibits Brettanomyces character would be classified as \"American-style Brett Ale.\" A statement by the brewer that could include information such as style being elaborated upon, and other information about the entry with regard to flavor, aroma or appearance, is essential for fair assessment in competitions.

He\u2019s better known as Dr. Pat and has already worked with Sam on his Ancient Ales: beers inspired by the world ancient civilizations.\r\nThe idea is to create a \u201cbeer\u201d which the Etruscan may have drunk more than 2,500 years ago. Under Dr. Pat\u2019s supervision, ingredients have been selected on the basis of the findings made at several Italian archeological sites.\r\nThe complex recipe has been shared by the three master brewers and each one of them has then decided to use a different fermentation technique. Baladin has chosen a large oak barrel, Birra del Borgo uses amphorae and Dogfish Head has gone for copper.\r\nFor Baladin, the malty component comes almost entirely from the malt made from the barley grown in its fields in Melfi, with the addition of \u201cSenatore Cappelli\u201d wheat.\r\nThe significant addition of spices has been the focus of the research carried out on Etruscan habits, as they would spiced fermented drinks with hazelnut flour, pomegranate and pomegranate juice, honeys, sultanas, natural resin and gentian root.\r\nThe quantity of hops is kept to the minimum allowed by existing regulations, and they all come from the Italian fields farmed by Baladin.\r\nFinally, the yeast comes from an ancient strain \u2013 over 1,500 old \u2013 obtained thanks to our biologist friend Duccio Cavallieri, teacher at the Research and Development Center of the Edmund Mach Foundation in S.

In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world. It is always a place where good food is accompanied not only by our beers but by good music and by the sympathy of the staff who always has a smile for everyone and where it is customary to a friendly \"welcome\", a hello and a good day to all those who pass through it if only for a small beer refreshing.","website":"http:\/\/www.baladin.it\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1kXTo5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Piazza V Luglio, 15","locality":"Piozzo","postalCode":"0","phone":"39-0173-795431","latitude":44.5154291,"longitude":7.8921316,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IT","name":"ITALY","displayName":"Italy","isoThree":"ITA","numberCode":380,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AFT4jW","name":"Etrusca","nameDisplay":"Etrusca","description":"Created together with our friends Sam Calagione and Dr. Pat McGovern from the States and Baladin's founder Teo Musso, that\u2019s really something unique: as we used unusual ingredients (for a beer) and most of all an unusual fermentation system (the amphoras!), the result is a real \u201carcheological find\u201d.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EHRB4SUDWI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together.

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels.
