The convergence point right before you jump off into the wilderness of the Olympic National Forest on your way to the Pacific Ocean, resting between the edge of the Puget Sound and the base of the Olympic Mountains, rests Silver City. This Urban-Suburban experience is a sweet brewer's mash of Seattle city life and breathtaking outdoor adventure, all within ones reach. Beer, well made, brings the people of the \"Silver City\" together in celebration of having it all.\r\n\r\nSilver City was started in 1996 by Co-owners Steve & Scott Houmes, and it remains a locally owned and operated business. Silver City Brewery's handcrafted beers are available on draft, in 22oz bottles, 12oz bottle & 12oz can 6-packs across Washington State in bars, restaurants, and grocery stores.\r\n\r\nSilver City Brewery's production facility & brewery taproom is located at 206 Katy Penman Ave. in Bremerton, WA. Silver City Restaurant is located in Silverdale at 2799 NW Myhre Rd.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.","website":"http:\/\/silvercity.beer","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:44:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LCKMU86SX5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"XDsUGb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2799 NW Myhre Road","locality":"Silverdale","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98383","phone":"360-698-5879","website":"http:\/\/www.silvercitybrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":47.659282,"longitude":-122.687358,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2017-06-12 18:32:03","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IgNzA4","name":"Brewery & Taproom","streetAddress":"206 Katy Penman Ave","locality":"Bremerton","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98312","phone":"360-813-1487","website":"http:\/\/silvercity.beer","latitude":47.5615696,"longitude":-122.6780062,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-12 18:32:01","updateDate":"2018-06-19 19:52:35","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LypOPB","name":"Fat Scotsman Ale","nameDisplay":"Fat Scotsman Ale","description":"A big rich and malty Scotch ale featuring a robust flavor but with a smooth mouth feel.

When the going gets tough, remember to relax a moment and enjoy the \"Fat Squirrel\" in your neighborhood.","abv":"5.8","glasswareId":5,"srmId":25,"availableId":4,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MwwlaL\/upload_XDzcNo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MwwlaL\/upload_XDzcNo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MwwlaL\/upload_XDzcNo-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MwwlaL\/upload_XDzcNo-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MwwlaL\/upload_XDzcNo-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MwwlaL\/upload_XDzcNo-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:12","updateDate":"2017-05-01 12:25:56","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":25,"name":"25","hex":"7B1A00"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer \u2013 Scott Vincent \u2013 leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NorULV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"89 Bertie Street,","locality":"Port Melbourne","region":"VIC","postalCode":"3207","phone":"(03) 9673 4545","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","hoursOfOperation":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","latitude":-37.8286099,"longitude":144.9371032,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"C2bASy","name":"Fatal Attraction","nameDisplay":"Fatal Attraction","abv":"8.5","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C2bASy\/upload_JtJi2N-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C2bASy\/upload_JtJi2N-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C2bASy\/upload_JtJi2N-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C2bASy\/upload_JtJi2N-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C2bASy\/upload_JtJi2N-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C2bASy\/upload_JtJi2N-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-21 19:32:57","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:46:02","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"MOpp7e","name":"Howe Sound Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Howe Sound","description":"Howe Sound Brewing is proud to provide premium quality, all natural, micro-brewed beers to British Columbia's Sea To Sky Corridor, from Vancouver to Whistler BC.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.

Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Cu5xXG","name":"Two Brothers Barrel House","nameShortDisplay":"Two Brothers","description":"The Two Brothers Barrel House is Naperville\u2019s new home for craft cocktails, artisan beer and Americana comfort food.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San
