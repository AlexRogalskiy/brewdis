Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

It is no longer necessary to efficiently extract the sugars but with our malt forward lagers, decoction mashing produces a melanoidin-laden wort, which our yeast turns into in a truly complex and well-balanced Montana-made beer.  Sure, we could try to compensate with specialty grains, but it just wouldn't taste the same. With our lager beers, we\u2019re after superior taste.

Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:04"},"breweries":[{"id":"D1UQzj","name":"Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Rock Bottom Restaurant","description":"Our brewers eat, drink and sleep beer.

Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived. Well balanced with savoring\/sipping drinkability. Oxidative character if evident in aged Quads should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"9","abvMax":"14","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.084","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:33:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"mtUjck","name":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Karl Strauss","description":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company has pioneered the San Diego beer scene since 1989 with innovative beer releases like Mosaic Session Ale, Big Barrel IIPA, and Wreck Alley Imperial Stout.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.","countryOfOrigin":"DE","alphaAcidMin":4.1,"betaAcidMin":4.7,"betaAcidMax":4.7,"humuleneMin":55.1,"humuleneMax":55.1,"caryophylleneMin":14.5,"caryophylleneMax":14.6,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":26,"myrceneMin":15.5,"myrceneMax":17.5,"farneseneMin":0,"farneseneMax":0.1,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:31","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}},{"id":"804jIe","name":"Two Women Lager","nameDisplay":"Two Women Lager","abv":"5","styleId":76,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-10 14:12:48","updateDate":"2018-06-06 15:34:34","style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

Our marketing and branding efforts try to reinforce this and we choose to market by talking to folks instead of blaring messages through mass-market advertising.","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"Y","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:33:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lvNMRa","name":"Beaus Brewery","streetAddress":"10 Terry Fox Drive","locality":"Vankleek Hill","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"K0B 1R0","phone":"(866) 585 BEER","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","hoursOfOperation":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","latitude":45.5177348,"longitude":-74.6374259,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:36:23","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4WWGh4","name":"Tyranny","nameDisplay":"Tyranny","description":"Bold ale teaming with Simcoe and Centennial hops.","abv":"6.2","ibu":"44","glasswareId":5,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4WWGh4\/upload_UAnh1Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4WWGh4\/upload_UAnh1Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4WWGh4\/upload_UAnh1Z-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4WWGh4\/upload_UAnh1Z-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4WWGh4\/upload_UAnh1Z-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/4WWGh4\/upload_UAnh1Z-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-09 00:49:42","updateDate":"2015-12-16 13:58:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
