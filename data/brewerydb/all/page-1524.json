Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \r\n\r\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \r\n\r\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings.

It wasn\u2019t long until they found Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on the shelf, changing their perception of what beer was and what it could be. Tyler found a job at a local craft beer bar and they were officially enamored with craft beer. After trying hundreds of labels in a short time they were inspired to try their hand at brewing their own.\r\nLate Start Brewing was born in 2012 within the confines of a two-car garage in Tampa. Within a few batches of homebrewing, their hobby turned to an obsession. Brewing as much as they could, too often starting late after sunset, finishing up in the wee hours of the morning. They started serving their beer around Tampa February \u201813 exclusively at beer fests and special events. Around this time Tyler and Jordan met Streeter when they both landed jobs at Cigar City Brewing.\r\nStreeter helped them find their feet as they transitioned from homebrewing to the pro-brewing. They learned and grew as brewers together at CCB, they recognized Nick\u2019s qualities and had found their third team member and together hit the local fest scene. They moved to separate breweries to expand their experience all-the-while peddling their creations around town. Tyler to Coppertail Brewing in Ybor, Nick to Head Brewer of both Carrollwood Brewing and 7venth Sun Brewery, and Jordan went to brew at Angry Chair Brewing.\r\nNow countless batches later they have found a home for Late Start at Pour House craft beer bar in Channel District of downtown Tampa.\r\nWe are happy and grateful to be brewing in our native city amongst such a thriving craft beer scene. Big thanks to our friends, families, colleagues, and peers for the help and continued support. -Late Start Brewing","website":"https:\/\/www.latestartbrewing.com\/home","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a2ihzE\/upload_dM19zC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a2ihzE\/upload_dM19zC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a2ihzE\/upload_dM19zC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a2ihzE\/upload_dM19zC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/a2ihzE\/upload_dM19zC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-07 12:14:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"3CDT8V","name":"Late Start Brewing","streetAddress":"1208 E.

Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character.

We loved both beers so much that we decided to combine the recipes to make this year\u2019s Anniversary offering: Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. This beer pours deep black with a rich brown head of foam. The aroma is dominated by roast malt and cocoa. Upon tasting, the cocoa (we used unsweetened, unprocessed cacao sourced through our friends at Chuao Chocolatier) really comes through with a deep chocolate flavor and a long lasting bitter finish. The roasted grains used add coffee and licorice accents. It is a thick beer, but not sweet, with the addition of oatmeal in the mash providing a rich, silky mouthfeel that adds to the creamy texture.","abv":"9.2","ibu":"45","availableId":3,"styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Yv4kUK\/upload_mQPibv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Yv4kUK\/upload_mQPibv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Yv4kUK\/upload_mQPibv-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Yv4kUK\/upload_mQPibv-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Yv4kUK\/upload_mQPibv-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Yv4kUK\/upload_mQPibv-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:18","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

While our success in this pursuit is open to debate, there can be no question that we returned home inspired by the ghosts of Burton and by the experience of poring over 150-year-old brewer\u2019s logs handwritten in (India?) ink. Stone Brewing Co., after all, traces its lineage back to the British Empire\u2019s brewing history: We make ales, and all of our original offerings used traditional British styles as a jumping-off point.

From the imported white malt to the \u201cBurtonised\u201d water to the rare yeast strain to the most pungent hops Kent has to offer, we used all British ingredients to brew our \u201cEmperial\u201d IPA.*  While we may have brewed Stone 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA with our own distinctively modern, San Diego-style touch, what good is history if you can\u2019t rewrite it to suit your tastes?\r\n\r\nIn this case, our tastes called for highly intemperate quantities of Target, East Kent Golding and Boadicea hops, bestowing upon this dry-bodied ale a powerfully spicy, earthy aroma. On the palate, peppery hops assert themselves early and often, with malt sweetness making a brief appearance before being beaten back by a long, complex, and decisively bitter \ufb01nish.

However, when it comes to the Stone Anniversary Ales, it's all us. Yet, it is indeed still a collaboration with great creative brewers (if we do say so ourselves). We're talking about our own brewing team, of course. And while some of our beers, anniversary and otherwise, have been designed by a single person, the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA was definitely a team effort.\r\n\r\nThis year our brewing team was inspired by some exotic-ish additions of the lemony persuasion. Yes, it's a Double IPA (can you really say you're surprised?), but as we strive to do with all our Stone Anniversary Ales of the let's-take-this-IPA-in-a-new-direction variety, we've brewed up a Stone-worthy divergence from tradition. The amount of rye malt we used isn't quite enough to warrant the appellation \"Rye IPA,\" but it still adds hints of spiciness that contrast deliciously with the tropical fruit flavors and aromas of the Amarillo and Calypso hops. Add a few European specialty malts, some lemon verbena, and three more hop varieties to the mix, and you have a highly complex brew melding both bitter and fruity hop notes with rich toasted malt character punctuated by nuances of spicy rye and subtle lemon.","abv":"10","ibu":"85","glasswareId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-25 20:01:52","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:09:40","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"709vEK","name":"Stone Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Stone","description":"Founded by Greg Koch and Steve Wagner, Stone Brewing has come a long way since opening up in San Diego, California in 1996.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
