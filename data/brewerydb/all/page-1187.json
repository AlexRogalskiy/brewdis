This is the same type of wood that makes up the aging vessels for our Palo Santo Marron.  Though, the smoking process lends an entirely different and unique character to this ale when compared to the Marron, which is aged \u201con the wood\u201d.  Unlike most smoked beers which tend to have a camp fire and almost bacon-like character at times, the smoke from Palo Santo wood lends a much more perfume-like aromatic quality to this beer, similar to the aroma of pinon incense.  Notes of coconut, vanilla, and sandalwood dominate the nose with just a touch of ash of coming through.  These notes also come through in the flavor along with chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, bourbon soaked oak, and a sweet but spicy finish, with minor supporting hints of the familiar smokey camp fire coming through.  Despite its deep black color with mahogany highlights, this is one truly quaffable ale.  Perfect on its own, or a great match up with any of our wood grilled offerings or one of our delicious homemade desserts like the bread pudding or brownies and ice cream.","abv":"5.75","ibu":"25","availableId":2,"styleId":38,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-12 01:14:48","updateDate":"2015-04-30 18:48:33","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":38,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Smoke Porter","shortName":"Smoke Porter","description":"Smoke porters are chestnut brown to black in color.

The casks have a great story to tell and amazing flavours to contribute to the beer. The casks (French and American Oak) originally held red wines from Mills Reef in NZ and then created the special Double-Wood\/Oamaruvian releases from the NZ Whisky Co. The resulting beer is rich, nutty, and smooth with notes of dried fruits, raisins, Christmas cake, and tawny port.\r\n\r\nThere were a very limited number of NZ Whiskey Co. barrels, and we can coax the whiskey character out of a barrel and into a beer only once. After that, the barrel may offer oak flavour, but the whiskey character is essentially lost. Each bottle is hand numbered. The 2017 release is available. Annual releases are planned for 2018 \u2013 2020 and supply is very, very limited.\r\nCount yourself fortunate if you are lucky enough to get your hands on some of these bottles. It is a unique experience which can\u2019t be repeated and the beer will age gracefully for years. We expect the sweet spot to be around 3-5 years. Do not serve cold!

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"}},{"id":"pRXif9","name":"Pancho Vienna","nameDisplay":"Pancho Vienna","abv":"5.3","styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-08 15:30:50","updateDate":"2018-06-08 15:30:50","style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.
