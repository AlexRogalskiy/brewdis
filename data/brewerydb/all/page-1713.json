This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:23:48","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A5CLS8HOXR","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oPxIne","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23600 Overland Drive","extendedAddress":"#180","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"(703) 474-3050","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com","latitude":38.9629988,"longitude":-77.4992517,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:34","updateDate":"2016-03-22 17:54:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1VgfpJ","name":"Waterford","nameDisplay":"Waterford","abv":"5","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 18:15:32","updateDate":"2015-06-09 18:48:19","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"1aVp31","name":"Platt Park Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Platt Park","description":"Platt Park Brewery and Taproom was designed and developed to provide Denver and its surrounding areas with craft Ales and Lagers, with a focus on quality and not quantity.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"sjblac","name":"Elk Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Elk Brewing","website":"http:\/\/elkbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sjblac\/upload_2QxSy3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sjblac\/upload_2QxSy3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sjblac\/upload_2QxSy3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sjblac\/upload_2QxSy3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sjblac\/upload_2QxSy3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-06 17:21:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:43:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IZRU782YGX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"t2vl8N","name":"Elk Brewing","streetAddress":"700 Wealthy St. Southeast","locality":"Grand Rapids","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49503","phone":"(616) 238-5227","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ElkBrewing","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nTue:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\n\r\nMon:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nTue:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:00pm","latitude":42.9554501,"longitude":-85.6515277,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-06 17:27:26","updateDate":"2017-08-31 18:56:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nTue:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 12:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\n\r\nMon:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nTue:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"VMeZHo","name":"Elk Brewing","streetAddress":"700 Wealthy St. Southeast","locality":"Grand Rapids","region":"MI","postalCode":"49503","phone":"(616) 238-5227","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ElkBrewing","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 12:00 am\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 2:00 am\nSun: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm","latitude":42.955433,"longitude":-85.651544,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-08-06 17:27:27","updateDate":"2017-08-31 18:56:11","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 12:00 am\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 2:00 am\nSun: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"CK3s3j","name":"Elk Brewing","streetAddress":"400 Dodge St.","locality":"Comstock Park","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49321","website":"http:\/\/www.elkbrewing.com","latitude":43.045054,"longitude":-85.6587918,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-28 02:44:57","updateDate":"2018-04-10 14:01:29","timezoneId":"America\/Detroit","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"f4Ruw7","name":"Watermelon Dorado","nameDisplay":"Watermelon Dorado","description":"Our Watermelon Dorado Double IPA is not one to back down from big flavors.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
