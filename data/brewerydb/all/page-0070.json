This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"jnD5zy","name":"American Solera Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"American Solera","description":"A place where beers young and old can get together.\r\n\r\nAmerican Solera is a blend of unique beers created by brewer Chase Healey.","website":"https:\/\/americansolera.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jnD5zy\/upload_JJ1hGT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jnD5zy\/upload_JJ1hGT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jnD5zy\/upload_JJ1hGT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jnD5zy\/upload_JJ1hGT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jnD5zy\/upload_JJ1hGT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-07 13:52:45","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:01:46","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ALBCY86M1R","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wAriri","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"18003 S 49th W Ave","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","phone":"918-949-4318","latitude":35.9023031,"longitude":-96.0474338,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-07 13:53:34","updateDate":"2017-09-07 13:53:34","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KjhohM","name":"Amber Cream Ale","nameDisplay":"Amber Cream Ale","description":"A unique brew that is the perfect marriage of amber and cream ale.

The special yeast used in brewing this beer creates flavors of spices, notably nutmeg and clove and bright fruit notes to accompany. An element of malt sweetness comes in to balance the yeast notes. The beer finishes with a bright carbonation and a crisp dryness.\r\n\r\nThe Saison style originated in the France\/Belgian border region of Wallonia. Saison is not a single style, but more a family of beers. They were originally made in small farmhouse breweries and could vary greatly in color & flavor from farm to farm. The word \u201csaison\u201d means \u201cseason\u201d in French and Saison beers were usually brewed seasonally and used as payment & fortification for seasonal farm laborers known as \u201csaisonnaires\u201d. Many of the original Saison beers were produced in conditions that allowed wild yeasts to colonize them and impart flavors. These Brettanomyces yeasts are now being used by modern brewers to help replicate some of the flavors of the past. We age our Amber Saison in oak barrels with added Brettanomyces for a special fall release in our Barrel Roll Series that we call Falling Leaf.","abv":"6.6","ibu":"19","glasswareId":8,"availableId":3,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Plank-grilled Salmon Steak, Pad Thai, Gruyere Cheese","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2013-05-09 02:37:57","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
