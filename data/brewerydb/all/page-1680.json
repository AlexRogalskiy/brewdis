One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home brew around that time and would share his batches with the Goulets and their friends. What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

Six months later while only available on draft in Athens, Terrapin\u2019s sole offering won the American Pale Ale Gold Medal at the 2002 Great American Beer Festival.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"QLp4mV","name":"Elk Valley Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Elk Valley","description":"Just a simple home brewer who is inspired to turn his passion into a career.","website":"http:\/\/elkvalleybrew.com","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"elkvalleybrewing@gmail.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QLp4mV\/upload_v1zj8U-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QLp4mV\/upload_v1zj8U-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QLp4mV\/upload_v1zj8U-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QLp4mV\/upload_v1zj8U-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QLp4mV\/upload_v1zj8U-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-12 12:51:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:23:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H3JI06PSOK","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"H73z9W","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"520 N Meridian Ave.","locality":"Oklahoma City","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"73107","phone":"(405) 209-0016","website":"http:\/\/elkvalleybrew.com","latitude":35.4728651,"longitude":-97.6005357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-12 12:53:05","updateDate":"2018-05-31 18:54:03","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BEiPtJ","name":"Upful","nameDisplay":"Upful","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-08 17:02:19","updateDate":"2017-04-08 17:02:19","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"},"breweries":[{"id":"VjnZAd","name":"Upslope Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upslope","description":"Located in Boulder with two tap rooms (Flatiron Park & Lee Hill), Upslope taps into Colorado's active lifestyle by offering superior quality, hand-crafted ales & lagers in cans for the on-the-go beer enthusiast.\r\n\r\nAscend to New Heights.","website":"http:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/#","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VjnZAd\/upload_AWIYLN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2019-07-20 13:02:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"09JBTMX3RW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"89FEzM","name":"Lee Hill","streetAddress":"1501 Lee Hill Road No. 20","locality":"Boulder","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80304","phone":"720-379-7528","website":"http:\/\/www.upslopebrewing.com\/","latitude":40.0628561,"longitude":-105.2791958,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-03-08 13:42:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"},{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-2:00pm-8:00pm,tue-2:00pm-8:00pm,wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-2:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ha3HrR","name":"Flatiron Park","streetAddress":"1898 S.
