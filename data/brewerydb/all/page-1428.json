Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

It was Christmas 2005 James Thompson got his best friend Mark Taylor a Mr. Beer homebrew kit as a gag gift. Mark admits that he put the kit away for a while because it seemed \"overwhelming\" at the time. Mark had already made homemade wines but just wasn't sure of the kit's complexity. About six months had passed and Mark found himself wandering the isles of a local homebrew shop and decided to take another go at making beer at home. He spent hundreds of hours over a period of seven years perfecting his recipes. He was obsessed with learning new brewing techniques and the beers became remarkable. In 2012, James approached Mark again with a new idea to open a brewery in Sacramento's burgeoning craft beer market. Big Sexy Brewing was no longer a cool idea it was a reality. The team started by collecting equipment and pooling together the cash to start the new venture. It took three years for the new co-founders to find a perfect location for the new brewery. They settled on a cool little-forgotten warehouse district tucked away in South East Sacramento. James with a background in business operations and marketing and Mark with his craft beer background realized quickly that they were going to need help. In 2015, they recruited Ryan Moore the Vice President of a local commercial bank as a partner and Chief Financial Officer and to round off the team in 2016, the Reilly Family (Pat & Sarah) joined as the companies financial partners. Big Sexy's doors opened on August 31st, 2016 and to this day still holds true to the original vision, \"Quality craft beers everyone can enjoy\".","website":"http:\/\/bigsexybrewing.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-12 14:56:48","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:02:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"USXT8EO7LB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"L4lH68","name":"Big Sexy Brewing Company","streetAddress":"5861 88TH St","extendedAddress":"Ste 800","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95828","phone":"916.374.7332","website":"https:\/\/www.bigsexybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Closed Mon and Tue","latitude":38.5202962,"longitude":-121.3751571,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-13 18:29:05","updateDate":"2018-07-13 18:29:05","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-8:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Closed Mon and Tue","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CvQtMK","name":"Sexi Mexi","nameDisplay":"Sexi Mexi","description":"An amber lager that originated in Vienna before emigrating to Mexico, the Mexi is a light, toasty brew that is flavorful but still refreshing.

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived.

Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character.

Circusplaneet was founded by Frank Dejanckheere, Gadele Dauwe and Emily Ghekiere: \u201cThey dreamed of a better world. A place where kids, youngsters and adults could celebrate their quirky creative zest of life. And all of this in an atmosphere of trust, solidarity and fun.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt the 2010 Network of International Circus Educators Conference in Berlin, Circus Mojo\u2019s Creator, Paul Miller, met Circusplaneet\u2019s Co\u00f6rdinator, Matthias Vermael. An innovator, free thinker and showman, Vermael introduced Miller to BIRCUS, an idea sparked from the desire to eschew government funding in pursuit of circus autonomy. Fancy that! These kindred spirits bonded over a couple BIRCUS beers and planned to bring this big-top idea stateside. Miller licensed the concept and set forth to expand the Ludlow Theatre into a brewery connected to local history, community outreach, unique entertainment and stellar beer.\r\nIn 2015 Miller purchased equipment made in California by New World Brewing Systems in October of 1996, the month and year he proposed to \u201cGourmet\u201d Ren\u00e9e, his wife of 18 years and namesake of the LLC. It was fate: love, circus and beer. The brewing system has a 5 barrel mash tun and brew kettle, three 10 barrel fermenters and three 10 barrel bright tanks. Each tank has a glycol jacket and there is a glycol storage unit in matching stainless.\r\nThe TTB, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, has granted Miller a Federal Brewer\u2019s Notice. BIRCUS has secured a certificate of occupancy from PDS\/the City of Ludlow and microbrewery permits from the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the City of Ludlow.  BIRCUS is distributed in Northern Kentucky by Chas.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co!
