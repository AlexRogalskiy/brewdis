We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?\r\n\r\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER?\r\n\r\nWe want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

American strong pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruityester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"40","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"5.5","abvMax":"6.3","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"yfDPgj","name":"Indiana City Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Indiana City","description":"It\u2019s our mission to brew innovative beers for craft beer lovers in Indy.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"XRTc94","name":"Aviator Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Aviator","description":"Aviator Brewing Company was started to provide fine ales and lagers in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nWe also got sick of driving to the store all the time to buy beer so we thought...what the heck....lets brew lots of beer and drink most of it ourselves.","website":"http:\/\/www.aviatorbrew.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XRTc94\/upload_0x4xyX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XRTc94\/upload_0x4xyX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XRTc94\/upload_0x4xyX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XRTc94\/upload_0x4xyX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XRTc94\/upload_0x4xyX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:32:45","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OALKSJFZVY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"3GI0hE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 Technology Park Lane","locality":"Fuquay-Varina","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27526","phone":"919-567-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.aviatorbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday & Friday \u2013 We open the doors at 5pm, single tour at 6pm and close at 8pm.

Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the world's best barley- and hop-growing regions, and is distinguished by an ample supply of top-quality water.\r\n\r\nThe 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly fasts. They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called \u201cliquid bread\u201d and named \u201cHoly Father\u201d to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts. The beer was known as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager. Since \u201cbock\u201d also means \u201cbilly goat\u201d in German, these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats. Our Double Vision label features two goats in front of a waterfall\u2014a reminder of the importance of water to the development of the style as well as the taste of this strong lager.\r\n\r\nOur Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, CaraAroma, CaraMunich and de-husked Carafa malts to an original gravity of 24 Plato (1.096 SG). The malts provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with a hint of smoke. It is lightly spiced with Liberty hops, an American version of the noble German Hallertau Mittelfruh, and fermented with lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich. In the traditional manner, Double Vision is fermented cold (48 F) and lagered a full 10 weeks for smoothness. At over 8% alcohol by volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.\r\n\r\nDouble Vision\u2019s slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match for game\u2014venison, moose, duck, goose, wild boar\u2014especially when prepared with fruity sauces or reductions.","abv":"8","styleId":90,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e25bj1\/upload_5ou6IC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e25bj1\/upload_5ou6IC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e25bj1\/upload_5ou6IC-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e25bj1\/upload_5ou6IC-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e25bj1\/upload_5ou6IC-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/e25bj1\/upload_5ou6IC-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Try it with pork and saut\u00e9ed apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet sausages, ham or prosciutto.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
