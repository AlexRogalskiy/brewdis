A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"}},{"id":"YMRRth","name":"Mission Hard Root Beer","nameDisplay":"Mission Hard Root Beer","abv":"7.5","styleId":161,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YMRRth\/upload_3qclj5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YMRRth\/upload_3qclj5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YMRRth\/upload_3qclj5-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YMRRth\/upload_3qclj5-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YMRRth\/upload_3qclj5-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YMRRth\/upload_3qclj5-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-29 12:56:41","updateDate":"2015-12-17 21:57:09","style":{"id":161,"categoryId":14,"category":{"id":14,"name":"Malternative Beverages","description":"Malternative Beverages, also known as \"ready-to-drink\" beverages, are sweet, sometime carbonated, beverages that are low in alcohol.","createDate":"2014-07-10 14:11:26","updateDate":"2014-07-10 14:20:24"},"name":"Flavored Malt Beverage","shortName":"Flavored Malt Beverage","description":"Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that are different from traditional malt beverages like malt liquor, ales, and lagers in several aspects.

Enter Missionary Blonde Ale. We use only one malt (Pilsner) and one hop (Saaz) to make this simple, yet classically-styled beer. The use of ale yeast lends a subtle fruity character to the otherwise crisp, light finish. But the thing we like best about Missionary: Drinking it is so easy, anyone can do it.","abv":"5.1","ibu":"15","availableId":1,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"French fries with truffle oil, all-beef hot dogs, sesame soba noodles, fried shrimp poor boys.","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:42","updateDate":"2015-01-23 18:40:38","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
