The area has a semi-desert climate with hot days and cool nights. We choose deep, fresh soils, to delay ripening, and avoid hydrological stress. These are sandy loams where the clay component provides mineral nutrients and water retention, while the sand component prevents the silt and clay part from compacting excessively, and guarantees water drainage. In this climate we avoid soils with abundant superficial gravel, which increases the warming effect and might shorten the ripening season \u2013 which we rely on to give our Malbec its intensity and flavor.\r\n\r\nVINTAGE\r\nThe 2015 harvest can be summed up as a kind of a bipolar one. November, December and January had extremely high temperatures which accelerated the ripening process in the vineyards. These temperatures and quick ripening can dramatically decrease the level of natural acidity in the fruit, as sugar levels rise. In order to avoid this we decided to harvest 15 days earlier than the established date. Taking the window of opportunity from mid February to March 23rd, we picked up all the Malbec, even from the high altitude, cooler climates and vigorous soils.\r\n\r\nWINEMAKING\r\nGrapes from different vineyards are vinified separately before the final blend. After a careful, double sorting process, the grapes are softly pressed and fermented with indigenous yeasts in order to express each of the selected vineyard. Fermentation takes place in separate stainless steel tanks between 24-28\u00b0C for 10 days. Each tank is tasted three times a day to determine what is needed. The wine is then aged for 12 months in concrete vats.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES\r\nThe joyful and fresh expression of Mendoza is in this Malbec. Red fruits, cherries and a soft note of plums that have just been picked up from the tree. This wine is all about freshness. The palate is supple and juicy, inviting to enjoy glass after glass. Soft but structured tannins and a pleasant finish. Three words can describe this Malbec perfectly: freshness, joy and vitality. Can be paired with light fare or heavier dishes, but also can be enjoyed alone. The ideal service temperature is 64\u00b0F \u2013 18\u00b0C.","abv":"13.3","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-01-12 14:46:25","updateDate":"2017-01-12 14:46:25","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"}},{"id":"dhUeOL","name":"Malbec Pyment","nameDisplay":"Malbec Pyment","abv":"14","styleId":144,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-29 21:52:47","updateDate":"2018-05-16 16:06:09","style":{"id":144,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pyment (Grape Melomel)","shortName":"Pyment","description":"In well-made examples of the style, the grape is both distinctively vinous and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead.
