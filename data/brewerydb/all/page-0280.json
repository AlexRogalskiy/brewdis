Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Alongside Citra and Mosaic we deployed Mandarina Bavaria to give a pithy tangerine element to the aroma.\r\n\r\nThe Vermont yeast and oats leave the beer with that trademark smooth mouthfeel as required by the style, and although the ABV has increased we have retained the bitterness at around 30 IBU to leave that baseline exactly where it should be.

this beer was brewed with the Holiday Spirit in mind (with a little extra!).  Based on the great Golden Ales of Belgium, this pale but complex elixir was made with Pilsner Malt and a good portion of Pear Juice to add a crisp fruity wine-like finish.  But the real twinkle in Brewdolf\u2019s nose is contributed by a special blend of spices \u2013 Cardamom, Cinnamon, Bourbon Vanilla Bean, Cumin, and dried Habanero, which really puts Brewdolf in a holiday mood with an extra spicy kick.  Bold notes of yeast derived fruit and Pear upfront with which gives way to spicy complexity with intense heat that hits you in the back of the throat, perfect for warming the belly on a cold December night.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.

The name, Track 7 Brewing Company, was selected in part due to the brewery\u2019s proximity to the old Western Pacific railroad tracks, west of Curtis Park, and as a nod to the integral role the railroad has and continues to play in Sacramento\u2019s rich history.\r\n\r\nTrack 7's approach to beer is in the vein of the firmly-hopped West Coast tradition, but without fidelity to a singular \u201cstyle\u201d. This unfocused approach allows Track 7 to experiment with all varieties of beer, regardless of American, Belgian, English, or German inspiration.","website":"http:\/\/track7brewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4cUfa1\/upload_1TH4gn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4cUfa1\/upload_1TH4gn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4cUfa1\/upload_1TH4gn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4cUfa1\/upload_1TH4gn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4cUfa1\/upload_1TH4gn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-09 12:34:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:13:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"13PQIFBOER","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"yDJ7e2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3747 W.
