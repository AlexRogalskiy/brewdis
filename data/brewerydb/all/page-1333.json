Before its cultivation, hunter gatherers harvested it wherever it grew wildly, with the earliest evidence of its consumption dating to approximately 19,000 years ago near the Sea of Galilee. It, along with barley and einkorn, was a staple crop in the Fertile Crescent, and it was also used by the ancient Egyptians to make beer. Here and now in the 21st century, Riedenburger\u2019s Emmer Bier gives us a chance to connect a bit to our early history, as it\u2019s made with emmer along with lesser quantities of einkorn, spelt, barley and wheat. Like all of Riedenburger\u2019s beers, Emmer Bier is bottled unfiltered (naturtr\u00fcb), so expect a very hazy deep brownish amber on the pour, and don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s some yeast sediment in the bottle. It\u2019s not heavily carbonated, and thus comes across a bit like a kellerbier crossed with a specialty grain dunkelweizen.","abv":"5.1","styleId":131,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-27 23:05:50","updateDate":"2018-01-30 21:14:23","style":{"id":131,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Historical Beer","shortName":"Traditional","description":"Historical Beers are any range of color.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},{"id":"n9N595","name":"Righteous Candor","nameDisplay":"Righteous Candor","description":"Our New England style IPA is hazy, juicy, and absolutely bursting with fruit aromas from the aggressive dry hopping.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.
