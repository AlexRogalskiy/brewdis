Historically, the British dark beers have always been low to moderate in alcohol and very lightly hopped, so a British India Black Ale didn't actually exist. But we like hops and need little encouragement to add lots to dark beers as well as pales.\r\n\r\nTBB's India Black Ale is malted to be black and strong, with a relatively dry feel. Strong hints of coffee predominate, although there is no coffee in this beer. As with the IPA, five hops are used in this beer, although in different proportion to balance the slightly more acidic dark malt character.","abv":"6.9","ibu":"80","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-08 11:22:25","updateDate":"2012-09-08 11:22:25","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

In 2008, they opened a production brewery about 1 mile from their brewpub allowing them to triple production, take on more accounts locally, and distribute some beer in 4 more states.","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:42:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EXYPHWC9ZO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vuehNG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"724 4th Street","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95404","phone":"707-545-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.4414632,"longitude":-122.7117124,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2016-08-22 12:45:05","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Pxy2bv","name":"Production Facility","streetAddress":"1812 Ferdinand Ct","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95404","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.421129,"longitude":-122.709695,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-13 11:55:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BzJnwS","name":"Suprema","nameDisplay":"Suprema","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:20","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:48","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"J7LzNx","name":"To \u00d8l","nameShortDisplay":"To \u00d8l","description":"In 2005, sat Tobias Emil Jensen and Tore Gynther at a party at their old high school with their teacher Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8 and spat into a flat sickly lager.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"J7LzNx","name":"To \u00d8l","nameShortDisplay":"To \u00d8l","description":"In 2005, sat Tobias Emil Jensen and Tore Gynther at a party at their old high school with their teacher Mikkel Borg Bjergs\u00f8 and spat into a flat sickly lager.

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"umlCeh","name":"Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Stave","description":"Crooked Stave is a progressive, artisan brewery that strives to blend brewing science and art, through creativity and following our passion.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"umlCeh","name":"Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project","nameShortDisplay":"Crooked Stave","description":"Crooked Stave is a progressive, artisan brewery that strives to blend brewing science and art, through creativity and following our passion.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"aMWUHh","name":"Liquid State Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Liquid State","description":"We are focused on creating high quality, small batch beers with our 20 hectoliter brewhouse.
