Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"wfAwfx","name":"BrewDog","nameShortDisplay":"BrewDog","description":"BrewDog is a Scottish craft brewery located in the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBrewDog was founded in 2006 by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie.

Black to very deep ruby\/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"ofSI0L","name":"Renaissance Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Renaissance","description":"\u201cOklahoma Born and Bred\u201d\r\n\r\nGlenn Hall, owner and brewer, was born and raised in Oklahoma.  He started home brewing in 1994 after a year abroad studying Linguistics at The Braunschweig Technical University in Germany.  He actually caught the bug 5 years earlier on one of his high school exchange trips to Clauthal-Zellerfeld in Germany.  While on an excursion with the group to London, the father of the family he was staying with served him his homebrewed John Bull.  He would never forget it, but would wait to brew his own until the legal age of 21.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from the University of Oklahoma with degrees in International Business, German and Management Information Systems, he started a 16 year career in the Information Technology business that was very successful.  Many lasting relationships were formed during this time.  Many of his biggest supporters come from this IT family as well as his extended Soccer family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000 he and his wife moved to Tulsa into a home in the Renaissance neighborhood.  They quickly fell in love with its charm, character, neighbors, surrounding shops, accessibility and walkability.  He served as the neighborhood president for 4 years from 2006 through 2010 and ever since as Treasurer on the board.  There are so many things that they liked about living in this part of Midtown Tulsa that when they had kids they renovated their house versus moving to another part of town.\r\n\r\nGlenn continued to dream of becoming a professional brewer someday and was always looking to further his education in the brewing field.  In 2008 while taking a tour of a brewery in Hood River, Oregon he decided to start taking the necessary steps to make this dream a reality.  He began to read anything and everything beer related and of course brewed and brewed.  In October of 2011 the Hall\u2019s founded the Renaissance Brewing Company and purchased a dilapidated commercial property in their neighborhood at 12th and Lewis where they wanted to build the brewery building.  Tulsa\u2019s antiquated zoning laws, however, only allowed breweries in Industrial areas so they had to apply for a zoning variance.  Although this was a delay of over a year, Glenn never lost track of his vision.\r\n\r\nHe completed the Concise Course in Brewing Technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago, Ill. as well as the esteemed International Diploma Program from the World Brewing Academy which is a partnership between the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago and the Doemens Institute in Munich, Germany.  Glenn also successfully completed the Colorado Boy Brewery and Pub Immersion Course with the famous Tom Hennessy in Ridgway Colorado.  Tom will always be his mentor as well as all the other breweries that have helped along the way.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long journey and a long road still to tread, so Prost!","website":"http:\/\/www.renaissancebeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P07215MSRB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"orNo5d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1147 S Lewis Ave.","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74104","website":"www.renaissancebeer.com","latitude":36.1462265,"longitude":-95.9580406,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:52","updateDate":"2018-01-15 21:29:50","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Z8Jui4","name":"Abundansea","nameDisplay":"Abundansea","description":"Imperial Stout: AZ Lactose, AZ roasted cacao nibs, Faroe Island seaweed","abv":"10","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-13 20:31:04","updateDate":"2018-12-13 20:31:04","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

Since then he has seen explosive sales growth, as hard cider has moved beyond specialty beer and liquor stores and established itself on the supermarket shelves as a new drink category.\r\n\r\nWith Sonoma's superior apple juice giving Ace Ciders their great fresh taste and House's expertise and in-depth knowledge of the hard cider business providing a marketing edge, CCC is beginning to take a dominant position in this increasingly significant new beverage market.\r\n\r\nAs with all alcoholic beverages, we urge you to please drink responsibly.","website":"http:\/\/www.acecider.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZIDkN9\/upload_jwS6yA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZIDkN9\/upload_jwS6yA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZIDkN9\/upload_jwS6yA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZIDkN9\/upload_jwS6yA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ZIDkN9\/upload_jwS6yA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kuAItj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2064 Gravenstein Highway North","extendedAddress":"Building 4","locality":"Sebastopol","region":"California","postalCode":"95472","phone":"707-829-1101","website":"http:\/\/www.acecider.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"ACE- in-the-HOLE Pub is open on Fridays only from 2pm-5pm.","latitude":38.424961,"longitude":-122.848101,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"ACE- in-the-HOLE Pub is open on Fridays only from 2pm-5pm.","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LfOyQM","name":"Ace Hill Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Ace Hill Pilsner","description":"The Ace Hill Pilsner is a beer that can always hit the spot.

Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"},"breweries":[{"id":"L4lH68","name":"Ace Hill Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Ace Hill","description":"At Ace Hill, we\u2019re passionate about good times with good friends.
