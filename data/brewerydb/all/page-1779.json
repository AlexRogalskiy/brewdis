All of our beers are produced on location in our 5.5 BBL brewhouse under the watch of headbrewer Carston Haney. He produces a wide variety of beers, from the light, refreshing Siskiyou Golden Ale to the deep, impenetrable Black Bear Double Stout, which won the Gold Medal at the 2003 GABF and the Silver Medal in 2006 and 2008 in the foreign-style stout category. In addition, there is always at least one seasonal beer on tap to fit the mood of the season and one selection served on nitrogen.","website":"http:\/\/www.alamedabrewhouse.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t5YwQy\/upload_pSCmyX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"16OBTZXNR9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WDrFlD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4765 NE Fremont St","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97213","phone":"503-460-9025","website":"http:\/\/www.alamedabrewhouse.com\/","latitude":45.5484823,"longitude":-122.613645,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:05","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5JtwpP","name":"Yellowbeard Pils","nameDisplay":"Yellowbeard Pils","description":"This Pilsner has a fantastic malty aroma with a slight spice from the hops.

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"HVsapW","name":"Dark Horse Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Dark Horse","description":"Humble beginnings gave way to lessons learned of brewing in the shadows of the residence hall; steering clear of the landlord and having your ass handed to you by the almighty dollar are now consumed by the glory bells of success and the daily grind - a dichotomy of sorts\u2026 Should a young madman have to bend and be Ned Beatty\u2019d to sell and serve to please the public eye\u2019s nerve endings from the very beginning?
