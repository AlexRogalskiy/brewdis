It draws inspirations from the Belgian Saisons. It is surprisingly spicy due to the use of wild flowers, chamomile, coriander, green peppercorn and ginger. Deep gold with orange highlights, it has exceptionally floral and spicy aromas. It finishes with a quenching dryness and an earthy bitterness. It is an ode to spring.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA journey through forests and dales, a hymn of hope for the day to come\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis beer is particularly dear to me. I envisioned it while I was training at Birrificio Italiano (an Italian brewpub) during the spring of 2006. I was extremely excited, I could feel the dream that I had long held in my heart about to come true. Every morning I used to say \u201cThis is a new day\u201d and since the first blossoms on the trees were enunciating the coming of spring, I decided to brew a beer to honor the season, rebirth and new beginnings.\r\n To express my vision I decided on a Saison because it is a beer strongly connected to the land. (Saisons are traditionally brewed by the farmers of the Hainaut region in Belgium.)\r\n Although choosing the beer was simple, selecting the herbs and spices was surprisingly difficult. I wanted both to recall the scent of a blooming field and create a fresh, intriguing and easy to drink beer. In order to achieve the right balance of herbs and spices, I remember drinking herbal infusions every day during that winter.\r\n\r\nI had no doubt on the name. I called it \u201cNew Morning\u201d after Bob Dylan\u2019s song about the awe for life and nature\u2019s marvels.","abv":"5.8","availableId":1,"styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Fish and raw shellfish, herb risottos and some varieties of semi cured cheeses.","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.057","createDate":"2015-03-04 14:45:38","updateDate":"2015-03-04 14:45:38","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.
