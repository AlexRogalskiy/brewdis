The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

It\u2019s hard to say why, except it seemed like the right thing to do. Maybe we\u2019ll make it again one day.\r\n\r\nAnyway, for the sake of history, here is our description:\r\nConfounded Mr. Sisyphus is a subtle beer, full of yeast, bacteria, leafy hops and grains. Mr. Sisyphus\u2019s roots are Vienna-style lager malts, which give a golden orange colour and a malty nuttiness. Light esters and phenols from four strains of yeast give fragrance, and a malolactic bacteria has softened the acidity during conditioning and will continue to do so in the bottle. At his extremities you\u2019ll find herbal German Hallertau and American Crystal hops, like leaves basking in the sun. Finally come Balaton cherries, with their spicy, musty, earthy character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a beer to drink at sunset, be it in the quietness of a darkening forest or with the stillness of the city surrounding you. We even wrote Mr.S his own bedtime story\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cA gentle breeze blew through the forest. The leaves fluttered, and the ripe cherries on the Sisyphus tree bumped against one another. Then all was still. A tiny, contented sigh then came. It would only have been audible to a bird close by, or perhaps a child standing amongst the blossoms near the ground. But a sigh it was, and a most extraordinary sigh, for it came from Mr. Sisyphus.\r\n\r\nIf you stand at the bottom of the Sisyphus tree, close in beside the trunk where leaves surround you, and gaze up into its depths, you might notice that amongst all the cherries hanging there, one is not quite the same as all the others. Perhaps you will notice a tiny foot, a twig-like hand, or even, if your crane your neck, an eyeball twinkling there amongst the hanging balls of fruit. Unpluckable, never picked by hand, nor pecked by bird, nor pitted and preserved in a pie. Never to fall gently and bounce on soft moss, to be planted and grow again. For there hangs Mr. Sisyphus, the cherry who cannot fall.\u201d","abv":"7","ibu":"50","glasswareId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-23 19:28:17","updateDate":"2012-04-23 19:28:17","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

To achieve this vision, we stand our craft beers on the shoulders of native ingredients and artisan practices, balancing them with modern-day expertise.","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@trilliumbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SsYPgS\/upload_ZW01Ek-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:53:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"452A9H071U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0vUBsZ","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Brookline","region":"Massachusetts","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.333473,"longitude":-71.120476,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Vy6jKr","name":"Trillium Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"369 Congress St","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"(617) 453-8745","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":42.3498417,"longitude":-71.0480154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-23 17:57:40","updateDate":"2015-08-17 16:26:05","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nThu:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 7:30pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xrLwng","name":"Canton Tasting Room","streetAddress":"110 Shawmut Rd.","locality":"Canton","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02021","phone":"781-562-0073","website":"http:\/\/www.trilliumbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1844198,"longitude":-71.1524525,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-03 20:17:35","updateDate":"2016-06-09 15:27:13","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:30pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-12:00pm-7:30pm,tue-12:00pm-7:30pm,wed-12:00pm-7:30pm,thu-12:00pm-7:30pm,fri-12:00pm-7:30pm,sat-12:00pm-7:30pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bAmbB0","name":"Congruent Pale","nameDisplay":"Congruent Pale","abv":"5","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-04-17 12:32:53","updateDate":"2017-04-17 12:32:53","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Sour","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged sour beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood and has developed a bacterial induced natural acidity. This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"em9Lxc","name":"Two Roads Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Two Roads","description":"Two Roads isn\u2019t just the logo on our brewery building, it\u2019s our philosophy.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"QXV3e8","name":"Vernacular Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Vernacular","description":"a super small brewing project in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","website":"https:\/\/www.Vernacular.beer","established":"2018","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.Vernacular.beer","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXV3e8\/upload_Z2hDxP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXV3e8\/upload_Z2hDxP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXV3e8\/upload_Z2hDxP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXV3e8\/upload_Z2hDxP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QXV3e8\/upload_Z2hDxP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-08 15:43:23","updateDate":"2019-09-18 10:24:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Le42bI","name":"Vernacular","streetAddress":"505 South 5th Street","locality":"Milwaukee","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53204","phone":"414-909-0610","latitude":43.026082,"longitude":-87.917236,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-08 15:47:48","updateDate":"2019-07-09 13:15:13","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"a0oqf0","name":"Conscious Culture Festiveale","nameDisplay":"Conscious Culture Festiveale","glasswareId":5,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/a0oqf0\/upload_cMJBUb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/a0oqf0\/upload_cMJBUb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/a0oqf0\/upload_cMJBUb-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/a0oqf0\/upload_cMJBUb-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/a0oqf0\/upload_cMJBUb-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/a0oqf0\/upload_cMJBUb-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:01","updateDate":"2015-12-16 10:48:09","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"irUeaM","name":"Great South Bay Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Great South Bay","description":"GSB is a Craft Brewery in Long Island, NY, Specializing in American, Belgian & German Beers, with much added creativity.","website":"http:\/\/greatsouthbaybrewery.com\/","established":"2009","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.greatsouthbaybrewery.com\/signup.php","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/irUeaM\/upload_57MeXt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/irUeaM\/upload_57MeXt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/irUeaM\/upload_57MeXt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/irUeaM\/upload_57MeXt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/irUeaM\/upload_57MeXt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:28:45","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PL5DMJ8XN7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qXdmUY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"25 Drexel Dr","locality":"Bay Shore","region":"New York","postalCode":"11706","phone":"631-392-8472","website":"http:\/\/greatsouthbaybrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri:\t3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:\t12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":40.760611,"longitude":-73.264134,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu - Fri:\t3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:\t12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6pAgxq","name":"Conscription","nameDisplay":"Conscription","description":"Attention: You have just been conscripted into the 1st Roth Brewing Company.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"BSsTGw","name":"Russian River Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Russian River","description":"Russian River Brewing Company (RRBC) was originally owned by Korbel Champagne Cellars in Guerneville, California and was founded on their historic and beautiful property amidst vineyards and redwoods near the Russian River.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"BP3Svs","name":"The Rare Barrel","nameShortDisplay":"The Rare Barrel","description":"We are an all-sour beer company in Berkeley, CA","website":"http:\/\/www.therarebarrel.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-28 22:16:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:33:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"W50LJ1YXRI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eU1BSK","name":"Brewery and Tasting Room","streetAddress":"940 Parker St","locality":"Berkeley","region":"California","postalCode":"94710","phone":"510.984.6585","website":"http:\/\/www.therarebarrel.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.858752,"longitude":-122.2918147,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-28 22:18:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"O9oWJD","name":"Consilium","nameDisplay":"Consilium","description":"Consilium-a Latin word meaning advice or counsel-is a wise choice for any occasion.

(English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
