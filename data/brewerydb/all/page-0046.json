Starting off with a strong aroma of dank resins and citrus from generous dry-hopping, Aerial boasts similar flavors on the palette balanced against a restrained bready malt backbone, finishing with a lingering hoppiness that isn\u2019t overly bitter. The light body keeps the beer refreshing and allows the hops to shine through without too much malt sweetness to negate the power of the aggressive hopping. Enjoy with crispy fish tacos with a simple cilantro and tomato salsa.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"65","srmId":8,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cS103U\/upload_bGqLAz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cS103U\/upload_bGqLAz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cS103U\/upload_bGqLAz-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cS103U\/upload_bGqLAz-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cS103U\/upload_bGqLAz-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cS103U\/upload_bGqLAz-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.057","createDate":"2015-03-27 14:34:21","updateDate":"2015-12-18 00:17:00","srm":{"id":8,"name":"8","hex":"EA8F00"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

In January of 2010, with inspired council from family, Paul Coggins relocated to Georgia to focus the group on one purpose.  With the help of God, the group was charged to create the best dining experience for the community.  After many months of construction, permitting, setbacks, and discoveries; Toasted and Tapped opened its doors to the public on November 26th, 2010.  We at Toasted and Tapped are excited to offer the best food, beer, and service we can to the community which gives us so much.","website":"http:\/\/www.toastedtapped.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"i1FXcN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5603 Main St","locality":"Flowery Branch","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30542","phone":"770-967-8801","website":"http:\/\/www.toastedtapped.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Closed\r\nTuesday - Wednesday 11:00am - 10:00pm\r\nThursday 11:00am - 10:00pm (Team Trivia at 8pm)\r\nFriday - Saturday 11:00am - Midnight\r\nSunday - Starting March 6th - 1pm to 9pm","latitude":34.1854607,"longitude":-83.926168,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Closed\r\nTuesday - Wednesday 11:00am - 10:00pm\r\nThursday 11:00am - 10:00pm (Team Trivia at 8pm)\r\nFriday - Saturday 11:00am - Midnight\r\nSunday - Starting March 6th - 1pm to 9pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8BGvPZ","name":"AF","nameDisplay":"AF","abv":"6.1","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-04-17 13:10:19","updateDate":"2019-04-17 13:10:19","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
