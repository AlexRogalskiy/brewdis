It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery.

The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"yW9KR5","name":"Taxman Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Taxman","description":"Taxman Brewing Company is dedicated to crafting unique, artisanal Belgian-American ales.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"Af10Nt","name":"Station 26 Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Station 26","description":"Denver fire station turned brewery + taproom\r\n\r\n5280's 2014 \"Best New Brewery\" \r\n\r\nWestword's 2014 \"Best Taproom - Ambience\"","website":"http:\/\/www.station26brewing.co","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Af10Nt\/upload_B86b78-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Af10Nt\/upload_B86b78-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Af10Nt\/upload_B86b78-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Af10Nt\/upload_B86b78-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Af10Nt\/upload_B86b78-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-16 23:51:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:06:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P8LQ53OXNF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"AT5UIb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7045 E. 38th Ave.","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80207","phone":"(303) 333-1825","website":"http:\/\/www.station26brewing.co\/#about","latitude":39.769609,"longitude":-104.905894,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-16 23:52:40","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6ifvwx","name":"Cherubim","nameDisplay":"Cherubim","description":"The Cherubim (Chair-rub-eem) are powerful angels that have two pairs of wings.

The farm is a historic site, dating back to the Civil War, and is officially known as \u201cThe Encampment\u201d as the farm was used as a camp for Union soldiers leading up to the battle of Antietam.\r\nFollowing the Civil War, a fire destroyed most of the farmhouse. It was rebuilt in the 1890\u2019s on its original foundation. Today, the farmhouse, adjacent carriage house, and Civil War-era barn foundation still stand on the property. Additional buildings, such as the cider house and barns, were added later, designed to maintain the historic appearance and integrity of the property and surrounding area.\r\nRob Miller, his wife, Patty Power, and their three children moved to the farm in 2001. Prior to the Millers, the farm had never been used as an apple orchard. However, having always been cider fans (both fresh and hard cider) and with the farm located in a prime region to grow apples, they decided to enter the cider-making world.\r\nThe operation has been a family-affair from the beginning: fifteen of the Millers\u2019 extended family came to plant the initial 1,000 trees one weekend in the spring of 2001. By 2006, the trees were producing enough fruit to make the first batches of fresh cider. At this point, construction on the cider house commenced.\r\nBy 2008, the cider house was officially completed and approved to be open for business. During this time, numerous home-brew cider-makers discovered the farm and would buy fresh cider to take home and ferment into hard cider. Tim Rose, one of the home-brewers, had come back several times with refreshing cider and well-researched advice for the Millers\u2019 cider making. Tim was invited to join the family-owned and operated farm as the official cidermaker for Distillery Lane Ciderwork. He has since moved from carboys in his basement to his own building with stainless steel tanks!\r\nOpened for business as an official Maryland winery in 2010, Distillery Lane Ciderworks took its name from the rich history of the area. The whole valley was dotted with beer and whiskey-producing distilleries up until Prohibition. The remains of one of these distilleries can still be seen today down the road from the farm in the woods.\r\nDistillery Lane Ciderworks was the first licensed cidery in Maryland. More trees have been planted since 2001 and the orchard is now nine acres (over 3,000 trees)!\r\nSince 2010, the business has been featured in articles in media outlets such as The Washington Post and on the hit television show, \u201cDrinking Made Easy,\u201d where the host, Zane Lamprey, and his stuffed monkey, Pleepleus, visited the farm and tasted some of the cider.
