The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zUkUMx","name":"Equinox Dark Belgian Winter","nameDisplay":"Equinox Dark Belgian Winter","abv":"8","styleId":64,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:10","updateDate":"2015-05-06 18:20:37","style":{"id":64,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Dark Strong","description":"Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color.

The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"UpVCKX","name":"Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!","nameShortDisplay":"Dieu Du Ciel!","website":"http:\/\/www.dieuduciel.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UpVCKX\/upload_tibMtB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UpVCKX\/upload_tibMtB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UpVCKX\/upload_tibMtB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UpVCKX\/upload_tibMtB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UpVCKX\/upload_tibMtB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"GUtmoi","name":"Montr\u00e9al Brewpub","streetAddress":"29 Laurier West","locality":"Montr\u00e9al","region":"Qu\u00e9bec","postalCode":"H2T 2N2","phone":"514-490-9555","website":"http:\/\/www.dieuduciel.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday to Friday, from 3:00 PM to 3 AM\r\nSaturday and Sunday, from 1:00 PM to 3 AM","latitude":45.522765,"longitude":-73.593091,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday to Friday, from 3:00 PM to 3 AM\r\nSaturday and Sunday, from 1:00 PM to 3 AM","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"socay9","name":"St-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Micro Brewery","streetAddress":"259 rue de Villemure","locality":"Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me","region":"Quebec","postalCode":"J7Z 5J4","phone":"450-436-3438","website":"http:\/\/www.dieuduciel.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open Monday to Wednesday from 11:30 AM - 11 PM.\r\nThursday and Friday from 11:30 AM - 2:30 AM.\r\nSaturday from 2 PM - 2:30 AM\r\nSunday from 2 PM - 11:00 PM","latitude":45.773742,"longitude":-73.990711,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Open Monday to Wednesday from 11:30 AM - 11 PM.\r\nThursday and Friday from 11:30 AM - 2:30 AM.\r\nSaturday from 2 PM - 2:30 AM\r\nSunday from 2 PM - 11:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IMlt1Q","name":"Equipoise","nameDisplay":"Equipoise","description":"For Equipoise, we collaborated with Chef Paul Qui to create an authentic, well-integrated table beer to pair with the nuanced, complex flavors and textures in Chef Paul\u2019s cuisine.

The experience is unlike any other you can find in beer.","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:41:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"622Y3A","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"223 North Main","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74107","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","latitude":36.159253,"longitude":-95.9937507,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:42:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:09","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IwMl7T","name":"Prairie Artisan Ales Taproom","streetAddress":"3 NE 8th St.","locality":"Oklahoma City","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"73104","phone":"(405) 602-0894","website":"https:\/\/prairieales.com\/okc-taproom\/","latitude":35.4763325,"longitude":-97.5117798,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:50:43","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-11:00am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eZrsDb","name":"Eradicator","nameDisplay":"Eradicator","abv":"8","srmId":3,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eZrsDb\/upload_yymY47-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eZrsDb\/upload_yymY47-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eZrsDb\/upload_yymY47-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eZrsDb\/upload_yymY47-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eZrsDb\/upload_yymY47-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/eZrsDb\/upload_yymY47-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-01-22 21:05:45","updateDate":"2019-01-22 21:06:28","srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

We opened in June of 2015, making us the second oldest brewery in Athens!\r\n\r\n Like many of today's best microbreweries, the origins of Devil's Kettle go back to a kitchen stovetop, with some pots and buckets. Brewmaster Cameron Fuller grew up around winemaking, but when he reached college, his interests shifted towards beer. Unlike most undergrads, Fuller had a passion for craft beers, but affordability was an issue for a college student. He decided to teach himself how to make his own beer with just the help of the internet and some of his family's old winemaking equipment. Not surprisingly, the early beers were less than desirable, but a fire was lit.\r\n\r\n For the next 8 years, Fuller focused on perfecting his craft. The beers got better and the reviews were great, but how true is the praise from people who are given free beer? In 2013, Fuller entered a number of his beers in the Ohio Brew Week homebrew competition to get some unbiased feedback, with the mindset that if he did \"well enough\", then he would consider going pro. Well, \"good enough\" was never in question. He won the most medals in the competition and Best in Show. Not only was the path to professional brewing before him, he was practically being pushed down it.\r\n\r\n\u200bThe next 2 years comprised of financing, finding a location, and developing it to become a brewery. A lot of hard work paid off and we were able to open with a world class brew system, a gorgeous taproom, and an eviable amount of space to grow and improve our operations. We couldn't be happier with what we have and we can't wait to share it with you!\r\n\r\n\u200b","website":"https:\/\/www.devilskettlebrew.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dImT9P\/upload_iXLUcg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-26 23:44:50","updateDate":"2019-07-03 20:12:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7P8N5RWYS3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"M1gpEp","name":"Devil's Kettle Brewing","streetAddress":"97 Columbus Rd","locality":"Athens","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45701","phone":"(740) 589-7187","latitude":39.3492074,"longitude":-82.0954267,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-26 23:49:06","updateDate":"2015-06-26 23:49:06","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"loSfjp","name":"Eric the Red","nameDisplay":"Eric the Red","abv":"5.7","ibu":"33","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:10","updateDate":"2016-04-30 15:33:21","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
