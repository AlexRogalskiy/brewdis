Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners.

Their love of beer and the quest for mountain living lured them to move to Revelstoke to create the brewery in 1996. Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \r\n\r\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \r\n\r\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings. Most significantly, the brewery moved to a larger location downtown, in an old car dealership, which now includes a tasting area and retail space.","website":"http:\/\/www.mt-begbie.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bVrLGO\/upload_lRNo9z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bVrLGO\/upload_lRNo9z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bVrLGO\/upload_lRNo9z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bVrLGO\/upload_lRNo9z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bVrLGO\/upload_lRNo9z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-03 07:45:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TavGRG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2155 oak drive","locality":"Revelstoke","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V0E 2S0","phone":"250-837-2756","website":"http:\/\/www.mt-begbie.com\/","latitude":50.9929316,"longitude":-118.1628514,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-03 07:48:53","updateDate":"2018-07-18 17:39:28","timezoneId":"America\/Vancouver","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9vcj3p","name":"Taildragger","nameDisplay":"Taildragger","description":"Golden in color with floral hop aromas, and a uniquely smooth Belgian yeast profile.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"23","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:47:35","updateDate":"2016-01-15 14:47:35","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

Stay tuned to our facebook and twitter for the most up to date info!\r\n\u200b\r\nAround 1910, a 16 year old kid in Fort Wayne decided he wanted to be a pilot.  He designed a plane and built it with $1800 fom his parents after they had mortgaged their home.  Anxious to try his new design, he promptly flew and crashed the plane, demolishing it.  He redesigned and successfully flew his plane, possibly making him the first person in Fort Wayne to fly on his own.  This earned him the name Birdboy.  After making a name for himself locally, Birdboy travelled the country and the world, all the while updating and refining his design.  He became a huge influence on aviation throughout the world, and Smith Field here in Fort Wayne is named after him. \r\n \r\nThrough Birdboy Brewing, we hope to embrace Birdboy's adventurous spirit by offering new and exciting choices in the local beer scene.","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:46:42","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:34:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OJGXET78CY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cxmroT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"210 E Collins Rd.","locality":"Fort Wayne","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46825","phone":"260-579-5508","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","latitude":41.1217689,"longitude":-85.1395111,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:53:57","updateDate":"2018-07-25 18:37:49","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"zqCalz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"314 N Main St.","locality":"Roanoke","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46783","phone":"(260) 579-5508","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tues - Friday 5pm-10pm\r\nSat 11am-10pm\r\nSun 11-7pm","latitude":40.9634013,"longitude":-85.3728007,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-25 18:42:08","updateDate":"2018-07-25 18:42:08","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tues - Friday 5pm-10pm\r\nSat 11am-10pm\r\nSun 11-7pm","timezoneId":"America\/Indiana\/Indianapolis","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7bYEDX","name":"Taildragger 300 Foot Steve","nameDisplay":"Taildragger 300 Foot Steve","description":"Taking a page from its namesake, this freestyle ale changes the rules.

Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur compounds in aroma and flavor should be apparent, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. There should be no diacetyl detectable. Dry hopping is acceptable. Head retention may not be optimal. Contemporary Version of Kellerbier: Beers that are packaged or on draft which are unfiltered versions of other lager styles. These may share many attributes of traditional versions, but are generally fully carbonated, fully lagered, with full head retention and absent of acetaldehyde.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:39:16"},"breweries":[{"id":"PuOZUW","name":"TailGate Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"TailGate Beer","description":"TailGate Brewery is a craft brewery specializing in experimental, small batch, seasonally appropriate craft beer in Nashville, Tennessee!","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/tailgatebeer.com\/tailgate-newsletter\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_aUENLq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_aUENLq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_aUENLq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_aUENLq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_aUENLq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:18:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"3V6TA0ZJ1B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"XqWTM7","name":"Tasting Room","streetAddress":"7300 Charlotte Pike","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37209","phone":"615-861-9842","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com","latitude":36.119999,"longitude":-86.919825,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2017-08-22 17:22:39","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"NWxZNG","name":"TailGate Brewery Music Row","streetAddress":"7300 charlotte pike nashville TN 37209","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","latitude":36.1199298,"longitude":-86.9198973,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-01 21:27:53","updateDate":"2018-03-06 16:36:07","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-11:00am-11:00pm,wed-11:00am-11:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-11:00am-11:00pm,mon-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"DP5vwe","name":"TailGate Brewery Music Row","streetAddress":"1538 Demonbreun St","locality":"Nashville","region":"TN","postalCode":"37203","phone":"6297025914","website":"tailgatebeer.com","hoursOfOperation":"Su - Th 11am - 11pm\nF-Sa 11am - 1a","latitude":36.1526301,"longitude":-86.7913879,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2017-06-21 12:23:13","updateDate":"2017-06-21 14:11:23","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Su - Th 11am - 11pm\nF-Sa 11am - 1a","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kSUGO5","name":"Tailgate Light","nameDisplay":"Tailgate Light","description":"Why settle for a watered down version of delicious barley and hops when the TailGate Beer Light will make you a convert to the world of light ales.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.
