These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"}},{"id":"PJnYVp","name":"Life of Riley","nameDisplay":"Life of Riley","description":"Derek Riley was born and brought up in Wincle so life in the fast lane has never been a priority.

Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"}},{"id":"2NsDUk","name":"Light IPA","nameDisplay":"Light IPA","description":"An easy drinking session IPA coming in at 4% ABV with 37 IBUs and only 121 calories.","abv":"4","ibu":"40","glasswareId":5,"availableId":3,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2NsDUk\/upload_GlrRUc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2NsDUk\/upload_GlrRUc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2NsDUk\/upload_GlrRUc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2NsDUk\/upload_GlrRUc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2NsDUk\/upload_GlrRUc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/2NsDUk\/upload_GlrRUc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-03 12:20:02","updateDate":"2019-01-02 18:14:11","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
