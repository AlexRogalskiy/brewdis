Koji mold is a change agent, ie Koji will break down the starch molecules {long chains} into small chains of molecules and eventually into sugar. The sake yeast will then take over and convert those rice sugars into alcohol and CO2. Typically, only a tiny portion of the steamed rice is incolulated with Koji mold. The Koji mold will then start its \u201cmagic\u201d. A yeast starter {\u201cmoto\u201d} follows next {combination of steamed rice, water, koji mold, and yeast}. The \u201cmoto\u201d is then transferred to a larger vat where the same mix of water, steamed rice, and koji will be added {typically} three more times over the next four days {this fermenting mixture is called \u201cmoromi\u201d } Now here comes the difference to an ALL KOJI Sake: The entire steamed rice {not only a tiny fraction of it} will be inoculated with koji. This will lead to a much higher intensity and speed of starch break down {higher degree of aminoc acid and lactic acid} .

The 'Kilkenny' name was originally used during the 1980s and 1990s to market a stronger version of Smithwick's for the European and Canadian market due to difficulty in pronunciation of the word 'Smithwick's'. It now refers to a similar yet distinct beer.\r\n\r\nKilkenny is brewed in the oldest operating brewery in Ireland.[2] It is served in similar manner to Guinness; fully risen with a head of 3\/4 to 1\" approx. The ingredients are: water, malted barley, roasted malted barley, hops, and yeast.[3]\r\n\r\nWhile Ireland is the primary market for Kilkenny, Australia and Canada are the two largest importers of Kilkenny.[4]","abv":"4.3","ibu":"29","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wkNSDJ\/upload_joc9XR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wkNSDJ\/upload_joc9XR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wkNSDJ\/upload_joc9XR-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wkNSDJ\/upload_joc9XR-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wkNSDJ\/upload_joc9XR-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/wkNSDJ\/upload_joc9XR-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-05 03:32:47","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:29:32","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},{"id":"Oe2bN0","name":"Killed By Asteroids","nameDisplay":"Killed By Asteroids","description":"We\u2019ve really done it now.
