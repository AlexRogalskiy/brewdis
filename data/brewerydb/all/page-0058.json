Left with no way to buy beer, the two decided they\u2019d make it.\r\n\r\nThe first batch started with a Mr. Beer homebrew kit, two guys who hadn\u2019t quite read the instructions, and John\u2019s mom coming home to find that kit exploding all over her kitchen. Despite both being grounded for a month, their resolve was undeterred, and the two kept at it. By the time high school graduation rolled around, the two were winning some modest homebrew awards (which they had to send their dads to accept), and a passion had fully been born. On a trip to Ireland, Joe and John formally decided (over a toast of a pint of Guinness) that one day, they\u2019d open their own brewery - centered around their love of three things: great beer, ambitious creations, and the amazing city of New York.\r\n\r\nFully aware that neither knew what the hell they were doing, they decided to divide and conquer - Joe to study chemistry and head into the brewing world, and John to enter finance in the hopes of figuring out that whole business side of things.\r\n\r\nAfter 10 years, thousands of trial batches, and a few more boil-overs, John and Joe have reunited to create Torch & Crown Brewing Company.","website":"https:\/\/torchandcrown.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PbX50r\/upload_UIKCMa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PbX50r\/upload_UIKCMa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PbX50r\/upload_UIKCMa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PbX50r\/upload_UIKCMa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/PbX50r\/upload_UIKCMa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-08 18:26:12","updateDate":"2019-05-12 19:08:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"2L2112D80X","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"7OTST0","name":"Torch & Crown Brewing Company","streetAddress":"12 Vandam Street","locality":"New York","region":"New York","postalCode":"10013","phone":"(201) 452-4196","website":"https:\/\/torchandcrown.com\/","latitude":40.7262105,"longitude":-74.0043149,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-08 18:28:41","updateDate":"2019-05-08 18:29:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jrS21u","name":"Almost Summer Blonde Ale","nameDisplay":"Almost Summer Blonde Ale","description":"Sit back during Colorado\u2019s other seasons and enjoy the anticipation of summer days on their way with our American version of an English-style Summer Ale.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor.

Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.","website":"http:\/\/www.sixpoint.com\/","established":"2004","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/sixpoint.com\/connect","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:07:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"G3LAVWB289","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"QJRQhZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"40 Van Dyke St","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11231","website":"http:\/\/www.sixpoint.com\/","latitude":40.6739685,"longitude":-74.0119553,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2005","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-08-19 18:36:16","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RTMbqL","name":"Alpenglow","nameDisplay":"Alpenglow","description":"Alpenglow Golden Wild Ale is the blissful marriage of a mixed fermentation sour ale blended with a traditional blonde ale fermented with Brettanomyces that aged in oak puncheons for two years.","abv":"7","availableId":2,"styleId":170,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RTMbqL\/upload_171eqK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RTMbqL\/upload_171eqK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RTMbqL\/upload_171eqK-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RTMbqL\/upload_171eqK-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RTMbqL\/upload_171eqK-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/RTMbqL\/upload_171eqK-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-04-01 18:33:01","updateDate":"2019-04-01 18:33:52","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":170,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wild Beer","shortName":"Wild Beer","description":"Wild Beers are any range of color.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"uoQoRs","name":"Uinta Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Uinta","description":"Named after the only major east-west running mountain range located in the continental U.S., Uinta Brewing Company's journey began in 1993 with the reality that passion for craft beer and a hankering for the great outdoors could align in Salt Lake City, UT.\r\n \r\nBuilt on an axis point that endorses sustainability, community involvement and innovation, their compass guides them on a path to admirable, consistent craft beer leading consumers to discover a brand with passion, personality and soul.

The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"sCgeAO","name":"Torn Label Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Torn Label","website":"http:\/\/www.tornlabel.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sCgeAO\/upload_1Fsciu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-26 01:00:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:20:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LVUIGY87ED","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"BvUnbO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1708 Campbell St.","locality":"Kansas City","region":"Missouri","phone":"(913) 634-8001","latitude":39.0926304,"longitude":-94.5732837,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-26 01:00:59","updateDate":"2017-08-23 03:11:29","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
