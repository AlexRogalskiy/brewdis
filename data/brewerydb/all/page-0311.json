We use an antique wheat from Germany that has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. We smoke a small percentage of the grains over pecan wood in order to draw away from the juniper flavor. There is a focus on keeping the additions light enough that the smoke flavor only really comes out after your sip, not on the palate with the flavors of the ale itself. As with a traditional Sahti, the grains are filtered through a bed of juniper that we trim off of local trees the day we brew. We also add in crushed juniper berries to improve the juniper flavor without adding too much of a resin taste from the branches. In place of Finnish baking yeast, we use Belgian Saison yeast to add the peppery, clover, and bready characteristics that are traditionally attributed to this style of ale.\r\nWe can't guarantee that this is anything like what the vikings would have drank, but enough research and planning has gotten us a fantastic ale that, Viking or not...will make you want to smash heads.","abv":"5.5","availableId":1,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t0l4ts\/upload_NQVURM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t0l4ts\/upload_NQVURM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t0l4ts\/upload_NQVURM-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t0l4ts\/upload_NQVURM-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t0l4ts\/upload_NQVURM-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/t0l4ts\/upload_NQVURM-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-12 19:26:06","updateDate":"2015-12-17 06:34:55","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

The new, larger location will allow us to brew more  varieties of our beer, allow us to offer more packaging options for more  of our flavors, and to be open to the public throughout the entire  week.","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:05:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"TVFC0HX74D","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"1k3h3N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"405 E Marsh Ln","locality":"Newport","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19804","phone":"302-658-1826","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":39.7133698,"longitude":-75.5952293,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2017-08-31 18:54:32","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"tUMGQM","name":"Twin Lakes Brewing Co","streetAddress":"405 E.

The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

Dyckman Beer Co. was born.","website":"http:\/\/dyckmanbeerco.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1whFQQ\/upload_1eAzXA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1whFQQ\/upload_1eAzXA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1whFQQ\/upload_1eAzXA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1whFQQ\/upload_1eAzXA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1whFQQ\/upload_1eAzXA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 04:38:28","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"e4UXUZ","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"New York","region":"New York","website":"http:\/\/www.dyckmanbeerco.com\/","latitude":40.7127837,"longitude":-74.0059413,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 13:37:45","updateDate":"2015-03-08 13:37:45","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lwFnCY","name":"Cafe Cosmic","nameDisplay":"Cafe Cosmic","description":"Mocha IPA","abv":"6.8","ibu":"72","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-17 23:05:13","updateDate":"2016-09-17 23:05:13","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
