More than anything, we wanted it to be a beer that the band would want to drink while they played music.  We sat down with the band and tasted several beers together.  They loved the hop flavor in the Imperial Texan, so thats where we started with this recipe.  We wanted something lower in alcohol so it could be enjoyed from the opening act until the epic Toadies encore.  We built the recipe with caramel and Munich malts to give the beer a solid malty flavor, a bold red color, and 5% alcohol.  We went easy on the bittering hops and heavy on the flavor hops to give it just the right amount tropical fruit and piney flavor.  Lastly, we serenaded the yeast with non-stop Toadies music to give it just hint of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. This is how the official beer of the Toadies, Rubberneck Red, was born.  Its an easy-drinking, refreshing beer with enough flavor to get excited about.","abv":"5","ibu":"35","srmId":12,"availableId":3,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cJQhYY\/upload_9ZpL0J-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cJQhYY\/upload_9ZpL0J-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cJQhYY\/upload_9ZpL0J-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cJQhYY\/upload_9ZpL0J-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cJQhYY\/upload_9ZpL0J-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cJQhYY\/upload_9ZpL0J-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-03 18:41:35","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:13:07","srm":{"id":12,"name":"12","hex":"CF6900"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
