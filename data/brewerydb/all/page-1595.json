A dark figure emerged from the woods carrying a large black cauldron and a heavy burlap sack. The figure placed the cauldron over the fire and added strange substances to the pot. Soon, an enticing chocolate aroma permeated the campsite and the hiding traveler became more intrigued but was still afraid to be seen. Suddenly, the figure reached into the burlap sack and tossed mysterious pinecone-shaped vegetation into the cauldron, which began to froth excitedly, emitting aromas of molasses and blackberry. The figure leaned over the kettle and inhaled deeply, enjoying the boiling concoction. Finally, he raised his hands and uttered an other-wordly incantation in a disconnected language that the man could not identify. Tree limbs levitated from the dark woods and into the pot, stirring and infusing with the dark liquid inside. Suddenly there was a brilliant flash of light and the traveler lost consciousness.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"fz3g3i","name":"Pipeworks Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Pipeworks","description":"Pipeworks began, as many breweries do, in the stove top kettles and plastic-bucket fermenters of the home brewer.

We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them.

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"UgR74t","name":"Stillwater Artisanal Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Stillwater Artisanal Ales","description":"\"A sincere artist is not one who makes a faithful attempt to put on to canvas what is in front of him, but one who tries to create something which is, in itself, a living thing.\" -Sir William Dobell\r\n\r\nThe goal of Stillwater Artisanal is just that, living art.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma.

Not to make someone feel as though they are getting whopped over the head with history and facts... the beers...such as \"Old Wooden Head\" (our Imperial IPA... named for Confederate General John Bell Hood...who was a principal player in the battle.. and nicknamed that by this troops for his tenacity)... are made more for the spirit and the feel of the time...mixed with a modern cool feel.","website":"http:\/\/www.burnthickorybrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:56:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:14:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZVPQUDJ0XG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"So1N3d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2260 Moon Station Ct","extendedAddress":"Suite 210","locality":"Kennesaw","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30144","website":"http:\/\/www.burnthickorybrewery.com\/","latitude":34.033027,"longitude":-84.61663,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:57:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5iuEfE","name":"The Diffie Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"The Diffie Milk Stout","description":"Originally brewed as a custom beer for 1990\u2019s country music legend Joe Diffie.
