Tweeds Tavern will quickly become your favorite dark beer.\r\n\r\nTweeds Tavern Stout is named after the historic Tweeds Tavern, one of the earliest breweries in the First State. This tiny inn provided a favorite meeting place for early American farmers and merchants driving Conestoga wagons to market. Patrons enjoyed the beer that was brewed on the premises. The original, restored tavern is in Tweeds Park in nearby Hockessin, Delaware. To honor this history, Tweeds Tavern Stout has all the markings of a classic Colonial era Porter. Twin Lakes is proud to brew this Quintessential American brew.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"30","glasswareId":8,"srmId":35,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DVmN7M\/upload_ljHbS0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DVmN7M\/upload_ljHbS0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DVmN7M\/upload_ljHbS0-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DVmN7M\/upload_ljHbS0-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DVmN7M\/upload_ljHbS0-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DVmN7M\/upload_ljHbS0-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"-Rich beef like Sirloin or Porterhouse.\r\n-Raw Oysters\r\n-Creamy dessert, especially with fresh fruits like Strawberries or Blueberries.","servingTemperature":"cellar","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cellar - (12-14C\/54-57F)","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:25","updateDate":"2017-08-31 06:41:47","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":35,"name":"35","hex":"470606"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Each of our beers is associated with the dogs from the kennel as a tribute to the loyalty and companionship that defined each of them.\r\n\r\nWhile not in our original plans, Black Husky began getting calls from bars and restaurants in Milwaukee to see if they could purchase our beers. So we began driving down kegs and bottles to Milwaukee in our Ford Transit Connect van. First two or three kegs and cases and eventually we were turning business away so the poor van didn\u2019t collapse under the load.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Black Husky moved its brewery operations to the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee where we operate a taproom and produce our beers. Not much has changed. Sure there is a bigger building and a few more people in the team but the beer is still delivered in our van, and the same care and dedication to produce the best beer is still practiced to honor the 23 dogs that spent their lives with us.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhuskybrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ogteGT\/upload_WWBDrT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2019-09-21 11:38:43","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DJS4M3UBIZ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"lnGqhM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"909 E Locust","locality":"Milwaukee","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53212","phone":"715-324-5152","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhuskybrewing.com\/","latitude":43.0710218,"longitude":-87.9002127,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2017-10-31 17:33:41","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2gSt48","name":"Twelve Gauge","nameDisplay":"Twelve Gauge","description":"Just in time for the weather to turn, 12 Gauge Imperial Stout will warm you with hints of roasted chocolate and vanilla.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Avery Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Avery","description":"A Colorado-based brewery for over 25 years, Avery Brewing has a singular focus on creating the perfect beer.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EHRB4SUDWI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.
