The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

It was Christmas 2005 James Thompson got his best friend Mark Taylor a Mr. Beer homebrew kit as a gag gift. Mark admits that he put the kit away for a while because it seemed \"overwhelming\" at the time. Mark had already made homemade wines but just wasn't sure of the kit's complexity. About six months had passed and Mark found himself wandering the isles of a local homebrew shop and decided to take another go at making beer at home. He spent hundreds of hours over a period of seven years perfecting his recipes. He was obsessed with learning new brewing techniques and the beers became remarkable. In 2012, James approached Mark again with a new idea to open a brewery in Sacramento's burgeoning craft beer market. Big Sexy Brewing was no longer a cool idea it was a reality. The team started by collecting equipment and pooling together the cash to start the new venture. It took three years for the new co-founders to find a perfect location for the new brewery. They settled on a cool little-forgotten warehouse district tucked away in South East Sacramento. James with a background in business operations and marketing and Mark with his craft beer background realized quickly that they were going to need help. In 2015, they recruited Ryan Moore the Vice President of a local commercial bank as a partner and Chief Financial Officer and to round off the team in 2016, the Reilly Family (Pat & Sarah) joined as the companies financial partners. Big Sexy's doors opened on August 31st, 2016 and to this day still holds true to the original vision, \"Quality craft beers everyone can enjoy\".","website":"http:\/\/bigsexybrewing.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-12 14:56:48","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:02:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"USXT8EO7LB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"L4lH68","name":"Big Sexy Brewing Company","streetAddress":"5861 88TH St","extendedAddress":"Ste 800","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95828","phone":"916.374.7332","website":"https:\/\/www.bigsexybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Closed Mon and Tue","latitude":38.5202962,"longitude":-121.3751571,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-13 18:29:05","updateDate":"2018-07-13 18:29:05","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-8:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Closed Mon and Tue","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XhoSjV","name":"Tricycle","nameDisplay":"Tricycle","abv":"9.1","availableId":4,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-18 15:43:39","updateDate":"2019-06-19 17:11:15","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

As the restaurant business thrived, the guys turned their attentions back to the enduring dream of opening their own brewery.\r\n\r\nThe guys decided that it was time to stop talking and start brewing.  They teamed up with Graham With, a respected home brewer; and Michael Tod, a friend with a wealth of sales experience in the BC craft beer industry.  The newly assembled Parallel 49 team set out to create the unique brand of Vancouver craft beer that they had been thirsting after for years.","website":"http:\/\/parallel49brewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 23:41:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ixo7Nb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1950 Triumph St","locality":"Vancouver","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V5L 1K5","phone":"(604) 558-2739","website":"http:\/\/parallel49brewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Open from Noon - 9pm daily","latitude":49.2839053,"longitude":-123.0644391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 15:52:39","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Open from Noon - 9pm daily","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3kkLI4","name":"Trifecta Mango IPA","nameDisplay":"Trifecta Mango IPA","abv":"6.9","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-19 14:46:07","updateDate":"2016-05-19 14:46:07","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"GNz66x","name":"Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck","description":"Amandus Van Honsebrouck, born in 1811, farmer and mayor of Werken, starts the first brewery around 1850 in Werken.\r\nEmile, his son, takes over and moves to Ingelmunster in 1900 and founds the St-Josef brewery.\r\nEmile\u2019s sons, Paul and Ernest, take over and expand firmly.
