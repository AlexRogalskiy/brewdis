Medianoche Reserve was one of those mistakes and this exclusive bottle of Mexican Medianoche is our atonement. To create Mexican Medianoche, we started with our base barrel-aged Imperial Stout, Medianoche, which is boiled overnight for over 14 hours, and aged it in Woodford Reserve\u00ae Rye Whiskey barrels for 20 months. The extended barrel aging contributed rich notes of vanilla, toffee, cocoa powder, sweet tobacco, and a subtle rye spice. Then we aged the finished beer on Papua New Guinea and Madagascar vanilla beans, Vietnamese cinnamon sticks and Ghanan cacao nibs to complement the flavors imparted from the barrel, resulting in one of the most complex and decadent beers we have ever produced.","abv":"14.8","styleId":134,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fmmCJh\/upload_clmiDl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fmmCJh\/upload_clmiDl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fmmCJh\/upload_clmiDl-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-12 14:20:29","updateDate":"2018-09-12 18:26:40","style":{"id":134,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Dark Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged Dark","description":"Any classic style or unique experimental style of dark beer can be wood or barrel-aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

When life hands you Meyer lemons, make Meyer Lemon Lager! Once poured, the appearance is a bright, clear, golden color with tight white bubbles. The aroma of fresh lemon zest hits you, followed by hints of lager yeast, citrus hops and lemon verbena. The taste is tartness of citrus balanced by malty sweetness.
