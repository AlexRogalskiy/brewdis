In its heyday, the hardware Co. was the center of community activity, selling everything from pots and pans to remedies for livestock maladies, chicken feed and of course, nuts and bolts.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber.

The wood character blends well with the smoked malt.\r\n\r\nThe whiskey plays the supporting role in this beer. At first sip, the honey and chocolate are well balanced, with the whiskey finishing it off. This is indeed a dessert beer. The smoke provides just enough to balance the sweetness. Perfectly paired with a bar of chocolate smothered in toffee and honey, next to the fire while wearing your finest velvet smoking jacket.","abv":"13.2","ibu":"30","styleId":159,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1FLxD\/upload_3469SK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1FLxD\/upload_3469SK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1FLxD\/upload_3469SK-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1FLxD\/upload_3469SK-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1FLxD\/upload_3469SK-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/R1FLxD\/upload_3469SK-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-02 13:40:51","updateDate":"2017-10-30 15:45:50","style":{"id":159,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Adambier","shortName":"Adambier","description":"Adambier is light brown to very dark in color.

Astringency of highly roasted malt should be absent. Toast and caramel-like malt characters may be evident. Low to medium hop bitterness are perceived. Low hop flavor and aroma are perceived. It is originally a style from Dortmund. Adambier is a strong, dark, hoppy, sour ale extensively aged in wood barrels. Extensive aging and the acidification of this beer can mask malt and hop character to varying degrees. Traditional and non-hybrid varieties of European hops were traditionally used. A K\u00f6lsch-like ale fermentation is typical Aging in barrels may contribute some level of Brettanomyces and lactic character.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter\u2019s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.\r\n\r\n Having already established Margaret\u2019s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter\u2019s passion \u2013 brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He\u2019s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country\u2019s most popular brewing supply shops.\r\n\r\nWorth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret\u2019s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition \u2013 the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation\u2019s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries. Today, Worth Brewing \u2013 perhaps one of the world\u2019s smallest craft brewers \u2013 brings a bit of those days back to delight the growing number of those who appreciate fine, locally brewed beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.worthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"WQX8IFL6CM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Z5oRX9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"835 Central Ave","locality":"Northwood","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50459","phone":"641-324-9899","website":"http:\/\/www.worthbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room Hours: \r\nWed.-Thur.: 5 to 9 p.m.\r\nFri: 5 to 11 p.m.\r\nSat: noon to 11 p.m.","latitude":43.4437611,"longitude":-93.2202203,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2017-08-31 19:02:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tap Room Hours: \r\nWed.-Thur.: 5 to 9 p.m.\r\nFri: 5 to 11 p.m.\r\nSat: noon to 11 p.m.","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"t8Aq2x","name":"Worth Brewing Company","streetAddress":"835 Central Ave","locality":"Northwood","region":"IA","postalCode":"50459","phone":"6413249899","website":"worthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed: 5-9\nThur: 5-9\nFri: 5-11\nSat: Noon-11\nSun: 11:30-6:30","latitude":43.4440388,"longitude":-93.2203921,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-10-22 02:31:42","updateDate":"2017-08-31 19:02:06","forwardingId":"Z5oRX9","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed: 5-9\nThur: 5-9\nFri: 5-11\nSat: Noon-11\nSun: 11:30-6:30","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"elaQSS","name":"Bishop\u2019s Barrel No 18","nameDisplay":"Bishop\u2019s Barrel No 18","description":"Bishop\u2019s Barrel No. 18 is a balance of spice and sweet, an Oat Wine aged in WhistlePig Rye Whiskey barrels for nine months.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

The brewery was Aurora, Colorado\u2019s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.
