But when they collide, nature affords us a rare opportunity to paddle out long after everyone has called it a day.\r\n\r\nThese moments are a solitary pursuit with empty lineups. But those who carve graceful lines under a full moon understand how things can be dark, lonely and rewarding at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo next time you paddle in from an overcrowded beach break, remember that nothing tastes better than a cold beer after a session.\r\n\r\nWe suggest a roasty black lager for contemplating empty lineups and waves that go on for days.

Fortunately, this global cabal of brewing wunderkinds is nothing if not creative. The theme, appropriate for this group, was Bourbon & Pancakes.

Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
