This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Along the way, we\u2019ve made lots of friends and drank our unfair share of good beer, all while trying to do good in our communities and do well as a craft brewery.","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","established":"1998","mailingListUrl":"info@uplandbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:53:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8TCB25H9G6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"esM0Nc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"350 West 11th Street","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812-336-2337","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","latitude":39.1732971,"longitude":-86.5368625,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2017-10-12 13:33:14","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"E3tJa3","name":"Westside Beer Bar","streetAddress":"4060 Profile Pkwy","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812.336.2337","latitude":39.172339,"longitude":-86.586343,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","updateDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-2:00pm-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qNc7jU","name":"Carmel Tap House","streetAddress":"820 E. 116th St.","locality":"Carmel","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46032","phone":"1.317.564.3400","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/locations\/carmel-tap-house\/","latitude":39.9568182,"longitude":-86.1431514,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:10:54","updateDate":"2016-03-01 19:30:44","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ShKvsv","name":"Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"4842 North College Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46205","phone":"1.317.602.3931","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm -

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.

The experiences and trade secrets I picked up inspired me to start a brewery where I could bring new and innovative beers back home to the U.S. Together with my partners Brian Berge, Kevin Hilliard, and Eric Schmidt, we\u2019ve made that dream come true with Insight Brewing Company.","website":"http:\/\/www.insightbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_sgGwtx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 21:35:12","updateDate":"2019-06-25 18:41:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"36H4BQP70I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"elfZCu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2821 East Hennepin Avenue","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55413","phone":"(612) 722-7222","latitude":44.991933,"longitude":-93.21295,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 21:36:04","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:36:58","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QVlan7","name":"Double Dry Hopped Juicy Bits","nameDisplay":"Double Dry Hopped Juicy Bits","description":"We took Juicy Bits (our popular New England-style IPA featuring a huge citrus and tropical fruit hop character with a softer, smoother mouthfeel from the adjusted water chemistry, higher protein malts, and lower attenuation) and dry hopped it with more than double the amount of Citra, Mosaic and El Dorado hops, bringing the total hop rate up to more than 6 lbs per barrel, the most we have ever used in a single IPA.","abv":"6.7","ibu":"55","srmId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QVlan7\/upload_v732Pd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QVlan7\/upload_v732Pd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QVlan7\/upload_v732Pd-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QVlan7\/upload_v732Pd-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QVlan7\/upload_v732Pd-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QVlan7\/upload_v732Pd-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.066","createDate":"2016-09-29 18:39:05","updateDate":"2019-09-12 11:16:25","srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
