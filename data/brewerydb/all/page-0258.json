(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:20:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"Q8W2M631AI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"L92mVI","name":"Bottle Rocket ISA","nameDisplay":"Bottle Rocket ISA","description":"Pull the tab and getaway!

But while Matt\u2019s beer was incredible, his business plan was not (at least according to the banks) and nobody would lend him the money to start the brewery.\r\nUndaunted, he grabbed credit card applications on the way out, filled them out the same day, and opened Phillips Brewing Company on a mountain of credit card debt.  What palatial brewing fortress did this high-interest financing purchase? A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.  We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility\u2013the only one of its kind in Canada.  The same renegade passion and creativity that drove a young brewer to start a brewery on credit cards continues to be the driving force everything that we do today.","website":"http:\/\/www.phillipsbeer.com","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 07:07:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vTSRcK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2010 Government St.","locality":"Victoria","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V8T 4P1","phone":"250 380-1912","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","latitude":48.4326736,"longitude":-123.3673092,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 15:06:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wo9tB9","name":"bottleBOX Boston Cream","nameDisplay":"bottleBOX Boston Cream","description":"Brewed in collaboration with bottleBOX, this rich and hearty Porter has no shortage of chocolate flavor, mostly coming from the dark roast malts, paired with the rich sweetness of vanilla custard and you have Boston Cream Pie in a glass!","abv":"8.5","ibu":"40","styleId":104,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-14 23:42:27","updateDate":"2016-09-15 17:31:28","style":{"id":104,"categoryId":9,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Other Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Baltic-Style Porter","shortName":"Baltic Porter","description":"A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:03:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4T1VLSO75B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TkT8Rc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lyRl7f","name":"Bottleworks XII","nameDisplay":"Bottleworks XII","description":"Imperial Witbier, 8% ABV, sour mashed 1-2 days, and fermented with a blend of Berliner Weisse culture and Belgian Witbier yeast.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"4MVtcc","name":"The Bruery","nameShortDisplay":"The Bruery","description":"A boutique craft brewery located in Orange County, California specializing in experimental and barrel aged beer.

We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:16:20","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PD1LOINQV7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"015ObP","name":"Bottleworks XIV","nameDisplay":"Bottleworks XIV","description":"This NW style sour ale is a blend of Blond Quad and Blond ales that were aged in Bourbon, wine and rum barrels with orange zest for up to 24 months.Blended to celebrate the 14th anniversary of Bottleworks.","abv":"11.95","styleId":170,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/015ObP\/upload_WIWZIC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/015ObP\/upload_WIWZIC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/015ObP\/upload_WIWZIC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-19 20:28:10","updateDate":"2018-04-27 14:30:52","style":{"id":170,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wild Beer","shortName":"Wild Beer","description":"Wild Beers are any range of color.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive. To stand out amongst this group, you need to push the envelope and be out there to get to your niche and magic elixir.","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:39:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KY5HWFDR7B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lijo4X","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97225","phone":"503-296-0110","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","latitude":45.485627,"longitude":-122.753996,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"DnQkrw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"939 SE Belmont","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","latitude":45.5166668,"longitude":-122.6560412,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-04 05:03:47","updateDate":"2015-07-07 13:30:30","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"R2wFR0","name":"Bottom Bracket","nameDisplay":"Bottom Bracket","abv":"5.7","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-11 15:28:40","updateDate":"2015-09-11 15:30:59","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"PHkaP0","name":"Revolution Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Revolution","description":"Revolution Brewing is Chicago's new hometown craft brewery.

With its high elevation and cool evening temperatures,the area is known for its high quality wheat and malting barley. After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby \u2013 brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients. Owners Barry and Chris Hedrich and their basset hounds Stanley and Leroy look forward to seeing you in beautiful White Sulphur Springs.","website":"http:\/\/2bassetbrewery.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-04 22:12:40","updateDate":"2019-06-11 13:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VQBL3H4K0E","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Uc8Jz7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"202 Main Street","locality":"White Sulphur Springs","region":"Montana","phone":"(406) 547-2337","latitude":46.54816,"longitude":-110.9010709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-05 17:46:39","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:04:05","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"viOVJr","name":"Bottoms Up","nameDisplay":"Bottoms Up","description":"German  style light ale","abv":"4.8","ibu":"23","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-23 22:12:34","updateDate":"2017-09-25 13:54:43","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"shhuGO","name":"Brouwerij Van Steenberge","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij Van Steenberge","description":"The only operational brewery left in the Meetjesland.

Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"aixRsl","name":"Cascadia Ridge Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Cascadia Ridge","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0MBQNP","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"San Jose","region":"California","latitude":37.338475,"longitude":-121.885794,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"loNWzN","name":"Boulevard","nameDisplay":"Boulevard","description":"Light Indian Pale Ale.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

We also know how fleeting those days can be and that we had better enjoy them when they come around. Our Brown Ale is a lot like one of those days, a balance of flavors which blend into a pleasant pint which demands that you enjoy it. Characterized by a slight malty sweetess with a touch of hop bitterness and balanced out by an earthy background note provided by the wild rice, you can revel in the bliss that comes from enjoying that moment when all things seem to align to make everything right.","abv":"4.3","ibu":"25","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fIG0f1\/upload_bjQq5i-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fIG0f1\/upload_bjQq5i-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fIG0f1\/upload_bjQq5i-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fIG0f1\/upload_bjQq5i-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fIG0f1\/upload_bjQq5i-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/fIG0f1\/upload_bjQq5i-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-13 00:06:03","updateDate":"2018-01-16 21:25:04","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
