This cider\/wine hybrid combines our favorites aspects of cider-making and winemaking into a truly unique beverage. The grapes bring beautiful color, complex tannins and a light fruitiness to the dry, crisp cider. The oak aging allows the separate components to meld together harmoniously, allowing the different elements to perfectly compliment one another. Flavors of juicy strawberry, with a slight oak bite, and a crisp acidic finish. There's a perception of sweetness from the stickier mouthfeel of the grapes and oak tannins. A truly unique but accessible cider.\r\n\r\nCider-making Techniques: Grape skin tannins and pigments break down and recombine with the apple juice during fermentation, building structure and body in the cider.

Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"An3f4H","name":"Ciderkin","nameDisplay":"Ciderkin","description":"Based on nostalgic profiles of ciders everyone first experienced, Argus Ferementables Ciderkin delivers a straightforward apple palate, yet finishes dry and tannic.Traditional Ciderkin is made from reconstituted apple pomace that is pressed and fermented wild to produce a low ABV\u2014dry cider style.

Surrounding the orchards, the larger farm produces a wide variety of fruits that diversify the land and aid in the pollination process, including peaches, pears, and hazelnuts. \r\n\r\nToday, we grow a wide variety of heirloom cidre apples including French and English bittersweets, and American semi-sharps. In the Willamette Valley of Oregon where we farm, the ground is an ancient seabed full of rich and nutritious soil. With so much nutrition available to the trees, we have to suppress their vigor through pruning and selection to ensure that each apple receives the most intense nurturing for flavor and aromatics. \r\n\r\nWe grow our apples with specific cidre blends in mind. As you walk the grounds, it becomes clear that it\u2019s organized around specific cultivation and harvesting techniques, enabling us to manage a precise maturation on the tree that we improve with every year\u2019s lessons.","website":"http:\/\/www.ezorchards.com\/cider\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-25 12:58:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HhYZh9","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"5504 Hazel Green Rd NE","locality":"Salem","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97305","latitude":45.0046179,"longitude":-122.9477643,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-25 13:02:17","updateDate":"2016-07-25 13:02:17","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"9:00am","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-9:00am-6:00pm,tue-9:00am-6:00pm,wed-9:00am-6:00pm,thu-9:00am-6:00pm,fri-9:00am-6:00pm,sat-9:00am-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zHVR7W","name":"Cidre Triple","nameDisplay":"Cidre Triple","description":"Cidre Triple is created using a selection of bitter apples, inspired by the techniques used to make the famous long keeping dark beers.","abv":"11","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-02-28 21:52:15","updateDate":"2019-02-28 21:53:12","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"},"breweries":[{"id":"H73z9W","name":"Domaine Dupont","nameShortDisplay":"Domaine Dupont","website":"http:\/\/www.calvados-dupont.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H73z9W\/upload_hRsDHt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H73z9W\/upload_hRsDHt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H73z9W\/upload_hRsDHt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H73z9W\/upload_hRsDHt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H73z9W\/upload_hRsDHt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-08 16:11:34","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"NpZWdG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Lieu-dit La Vigannerie","region":"14430 Victot-Pontfol","phone":"+33 2 31 63 24 24","website":"http:\/\/www.calvados-dupont.com\/","latitude":49.1740955,"longitude":0.0090257,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FR","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-09 14:36:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"FR","name":"FRANCE","displayName":"France","isoThree":"FRA","numberCode":250,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"z3VfEn","name":"Ciel Rouge A Nuit","nameDisplay":"Ciel Rouge A Nuit","description":"Our Flanders-Style Red was brewed using a \u201csour mash\u201d method with 6 different grains, lightly hopped and finished with a Belgian yeast, giving this limited-offer brew plenty of tartness with a slightly-oaked finish.

In our Garage, you can find what drives us \u2014 quality craft beer.\r\n\r\n\u200bEstablished in 2013, we began brewing in what was once an eight bay garage at the end of Old Town Temecula. The brewpub and taproom was aptly named Garage Brewing Co, not only due to its previous life, but to show an appreciation to where the craft beer industry originated \u2014 in the garages of brewers. Here, we have created a family-friendly environment where our fast-fired, Kustom-built pizzas and quality, Kustom craft beers provide unlimited possibilities of flavor while bringing friends and family together. In 2016, we expanded our business and now also have an off-site, full production brewery in Murrieta, CA.\r\n\r\n\u200bFrom the beginning, we set out on a mission: to provide top-quality craft beer that tastes fantastic and appeals to a broad spectrum of beer lovers. We are committed to excellence and only use the finest ingredients, state-of-the art equipment, and top-notch coding processes.\r\n\r\n\u200bWe maintain six core, year-round styles while also regularly rotating in seasonal creations for a total of \u00b1 15 beers on tap at all times.  As an independent brewery, we are free to modify beer recipes and develop exciting and creative spins on standard styles to please all types of beer advocates.  We routinely offer new and interesting beers to bring our customers a truly unique experience. \r\n \r\nOur brewery equipment was manufacured in North America by a company that has built over 350 breweries and has over 25 years of experience in the craft brewing industry. This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves an exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:24:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:47:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYX5KUDZEG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Jki0lE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29095 Old Town Front Street","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 587-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":33.4825051,"longitude":-117.1432478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AFg2Zx","name":"Cilantro Lime","nameDisplay":"Cilantro Lime","description":"Wheat beer brewed with fresh lime zest and cilantro picked straight from our greenhouses.","abv":"4.75","ibu":"30","availableId":4,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-20 14:22:11","updateDate":"2015-04-20 14:22:11","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards.

I don't know that we recognized at the time that it was a life altering event; but, mostly out of desire to have more mead in our lives that measured up to the quality we had experienced from them we decided to start making our own.  Having no local meadmakers to draw from, this gave us the luxury of being unafraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients not associated with meads.  Some experiments failed and others worked great, all had a powerful influence on how we saw mead and what we thought mead could be.\r\nLike any hobby we dove face first into meadmaking.  Our goal was simple, to create memorable experiences through mead using locally produced ingredients to the extent possible.  Soon we were sharing those meads with friends and they shared them with others. I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.
