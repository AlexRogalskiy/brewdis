In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby \u2013 brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients.

One of the other bakers from her company, Conor Robinson, was learning how to home brew around that time and would share his batches with the Goulets and their friends. What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"lEuN10","name":"Nowhere In Particular Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Nowhere In Particular","description":"The hobos have long used breweries as a safe haven.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together.
