Often brewed with light colored Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers are well attenuated. The perception of hop bitterness is medium-low to medium -high, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:16"},"breweries":[{"id":"lCWiw4","name":"Brouwerij Smisje","nameShortDisplay":"Brouwerij Smisje","website":"http:\/\/www.smisje.belgianbeerboard.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lCWiw4\/upload_fgAJau-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lCWiw4\/upload_fgAJau-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lCWiw4\/upload_fgAJau-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lCWiw4\/upload_fgAJau-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lCWiw4\/upload_fgAJau-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-14 19:49:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"gjoAtS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Driesleutelstraat","locality":"Oudenaarde","postalCode":"9700","latitude":50.8450235,"longitude":3.6628096,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-15 11:27:03","updateDate":"2017-08-23 17:26:10","timezoneId":"Europe\/Brussels","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yV6cBD","name":"Wouch!","nameDisplay":"Wouch!","description":"Cherry sour","abv":"5.5","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-12 18:29:57","updateDate":"2017-09-12 18:29:58","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"Cu5xXG","name":"Two Brothers Barrel House","nameShortDisplay":"Two Brothers","description":"The Two Brothers Barrel House is Naperville\u2019s new home for craft cocktails, artisan beer and Americana comfort food.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan.

Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"zpUYUE","name":"Vanish","nameShortDisplay":"Vanish","description":"A farmwoods brewery at nature's mercy.","website":"http:\/\/vanishbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zpUYUE\/upload_vkEmJe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zpUYUE\/upload_vkEmJe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zpUYUE\/upload_vkEmJe-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zpUYUE\/upload_vkEmJe-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zpUYUE\/upload_vkEmJe-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-23 13:43:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:44:23","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"9FECOM481R","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"BVy9dd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"42264 Leelynn Farm Ln.","locality":"Leesburg","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20176","latitude":39.2220849,"longitude":-77.5373987,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-23 14:52:35","updateDate":"2015-12-23 14:52:35","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pOhZW7","name":"Wrangler IPA","nameDisplay":"Wrangler IPA","description":"Semi dry hopped I.P.A.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

The planning of Tin Cannon came through many days of brewing with together in Aaron's dedicated brew room, or in John's garage. Aaron is an engineering guru and built a tremendous 10 gallon brewing system on his own, to include an electric master control panel. John likes to tinker and build stuff, and built stir plates, mash tuns, a kegerator and the like. When two innovative minds get together, they bring ingenuity, focus, style and creativity to each beer they brew. That's what you can expect to get when you come to Tin Cannon Brewing Co.","website":"http:\/\/www.tincannonbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/asjZQA\/upload_LcgrOe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/asjZQA\/upload_LcgrOe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/asjZQA\/upload_LcgrOe-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/asjZQA\/upload_LcgrOe-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/asjZQA\/upload_LcgrOe-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-06 20:54:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:02:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MU3217IRGJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"YYPXMD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7679 Limestone Dr. #130","locality":"Gainesville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20155","phone":"(571) 210-5681","website":"http:\/\/www.tincannonbrewing.com","latitude":38.790468,"longitude":-77.59733,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-06 20:54:38","updateDate":"2017-08-23 03:10:26","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-4:00pm-9:00pm,sat-1:00pm-9:00pm,sun-1:00pm-8:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","tourInfo":"As requested","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cw27Gq","name":"Wrench","nameDisplay":"Wrench","styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-11 03:56:08","updateDate":"2017-08-13 20:10:06","style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

We make beer because we like to drink and we like to smile.","website":"http:\/\/www.finbackbrewery.com\/","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/finbackbrewery.com\/mailinglist.html","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:09:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MQC1VWPABU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"zwemPe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7801 77th Ave.","locality":"Glendale","region":"New York","postalCode":"11385","website":"http:\/\/www.finbackbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.7065426,"longitude":-73.8731778,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-04-20 15:20:51","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"S3Tq4K","name":"Wright Flight Wheat","nameDisplay":"Wright Flight Wheat","description":"Slowly Winter is melting down, time for the perfect beer to accompany the warmer weather.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

Unlike others that brew \u201cPale Ale Style\u201d  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pf\u00e4ffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don\u2019t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us \u201cThe Rothschild of Beer\u201d. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a \u201cLocal\u201d or \u201cSwiss Beer\u201d. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated \u201cKleinbrauerei\u201d\/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.  You can find us in larger COOP Stores in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland, on the Bahnhofstrasse in Jelmoli, Rio Getr\u00e4nke, Drinks of the World as well as in over 100 Restaurants and Hotels. In Z\u00fcrich, we are distributed by Heineken Distribution, Intercomestibles AG and Schatt Getr\u00e4nke. Quality without compromise. If you are ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit us!
