Appearance is cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"ueswRW","name":"Hi-Wire Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Hi-Wire","description":"At Hi-Wire, we really want to embrace our craft and be as independent and authentic as possible, while also managing to maintain an approachability to our product, as we feature highly drinkable, hand-crafted brews.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re fortunate to be able to be a part of one of the Craft Capitals of the country.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"rjomcH","name":"Chorlton Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Chorlton","description":"We make contemporary beer inspired by Germanic brewing traditions.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success.

Their primary goal is to serve the immediate local market with fresh flavoursome beer.\r\n\r\nThe brewery has been a long time in the making, stemming from a long passion for beer and many years of home brewing. Fitzy started out brewing his first beer back in 1987 as a 16 year old. It was a Muntons \u2013 English Mild that seeded the journey many moons ago\u2026 in an era where good ingredients and quality information were very hard to obtain \u2013 oh how different it is today.\r\n\r\nHaving become lost in the wilderness for several years, the passion for great beer and brewing was rekindled when working with some like minded individuals circa 2001 at Unisys in Wellington. They would knock off at 4.30pm and have regular Friday afternoon beer tasting sessions, blind critiquing whatever was brought in, including their own special brews. Needless to say there was a great deal of heated discussion regarding the qualities or faults of each particular beer.\r\n\r\nThe passion for great tasting beer grew to such an extent that when the Fitzpatrick family moved to Tauranga in 2003, a \u201cbrewery space\u201d was added to the new shed plans, for that \u2018one day dream\u2019. Ten years later, with the help of wife Catherine, that dream is a reality.","website":"http:\/\/fitzpatricksbrewing.co.nz","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:45:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MhuHRk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"19 Keenan Road","locality":"Pyes PA","region":"Tauranga","postalCode":"3173","phone":"037-648-5650","latitude":-37.7742129,"longitude":176.1140377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:48:40","updateDate":"2018-07-18 17:50:15","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZoLglA","name":"Citra IPA","nameDisplay":"Citra IPA","abv":"6","ibu":"55","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-03 15:09:08","updateDate":"2016-05-03 15:09:08","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SoEKu4","name":"Citra Mantra","nameDisplay":"Citra Mantra","description":"Brewed with 100 percent positive vibrations and single-hopped with Citra hops.
