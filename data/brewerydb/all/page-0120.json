It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we\u2019ll fill it up!\r\n\r\nWhat, no Coasters? You\u2019d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we\u2019d say \u201check yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!\u201d Let\u2019s conserve together.\r\n\r\nHopefully you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.\u201d But, then again, maybe you\u2019re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down. There\u2019s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We\u2019ll not think less of you. Becoming a soda pop connoisseur takes time.\r\n\r\nFrom all of us at Moonlight Pizza: Kick back, order another beer, enjoy the sunset, and don\u2019t forget your leftovers!

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind, and we continually build on that sentiment, by delivering a unique experience and award winning beers to meet the changing demands of the craft beer community.","website":"http:\/\/www.capitalbrewery.com\/","established":"1984","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001QKOUjm76P7aUowbU3bchMmLlIKSnJ2dJN7B3SnkK1I-Dde4Q3J1O8o_MbR3cMmc9UYntPMmGLsuW8he0ZzVEDAGaJ2Jp9MbLzBs7xf-IS0iQq4FuDhj02K5Wn2ywuNqT","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:15:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MSP6CET3KF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"1g0RBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7734 Terrace Avenue","locality":"Middleton","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53562","phone":"608-836-7100","website":"http:\/\/www.capital-brewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\r\nTuesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nWednesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nThursday: 4:00pm-9:00pm \r\nFriday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm","latitude":43.094848,"longitude":-89.5165838,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:03","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"5:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-4:00pm-9:00pm,wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-5:00pm,sun-12:00pm-5:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\r\nTuesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nWednesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nThursday: 4:00pm-9:00pm \r\nFriday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bnDcQ5","name":"Baltic Porter","nameDisplay":"Baltic Porter","description":"A strong black lager that was given an healthy period of cold-conditioning to achieve this impressively crisp beer.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.
