Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"FwJ3bJ","name":"Belly Love Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Belly Love","description":"Why Belly Love?\r\n\r\nWell... it's hard to put into words the thoughts that led to the name, because so much of it is simply the feeling you have when you consume a carefully, dare I say lovingly, crafted beer.

We continue to be grounded in family, friends, beer education, and the quest for the ever perfect pint. We focus on the range of flavors beer can provide, and offer an ever-changing variety of styles in our brewpub.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"7kCNmJ","name":"Jester King Craft Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jester King Craft","description":"Located in the beautiful Texas Hill Country, Jester King Craft Brewery is an authentic farmhouse brewery committed to brewing artisan ales of great depth and character.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation. Sporting a mixed grain bill and fermented with a blend of Belgian yeast strains, Lomaland offers the complexity and nuance of the most traditional examples of the style.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nC.R.

He is now starting the next chapter with the creation of Ecliptic Brewing.","website":"http:\/\/www.eclipticbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_qqjZ1A-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 17:06:40","updateDate":"2019-04-25 14:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"3UI2LECMO1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"x9Ssna","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"825 N Cook Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","website":"http:\/\/eclipticbrewing.com","latitude":45.5473404,"longitude":-122.6750989,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 17:07:19","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cn1t52","name":"Aurora Farm's Oatmeal Porter","nameDisplay":"Aurora Farm's Oatmeal Porter","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cn1t52\/upload_PtDyl8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cn1t52\/upload_PtDyl8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cn1t52\/upload_PtDyl8-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cn1t52\/upload_PtDyl8-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cn1t52\/upload_PtDyl8-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/cn1t52\/upload_PtDyl8-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-29 17:16:06","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:27:12","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"aW4MI3","name":"Alluvial Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Alluvial","description":"Focused on the highest quality ales and experience.","website":"http:\/\/www.alluvialbrewing.com","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@alluvialbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-04 03:47:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:35:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"W7T9G4V1AM","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"oKwTQ7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3715 West 190th St.","locality":"Ames","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50014","website":"http:\/\/www.alluvialbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4-10 pm\r\nFriday 4-10 pm\r\nSaturday 12-10 pm\r\nSunday 12-6 pm","latitude":42.0797398,"longitude":-93.6666199,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-04 03:47:07","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:15:05","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4-10 pm\r\nFriday 4-10 pm\r\nSaturday 12-10 pm\r\nSunday 12-6 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MZ4Rj9","name":"Aurumglass","nameDisplay":"Aurumglass","description":"This beer is brewed in the golden ale style.
