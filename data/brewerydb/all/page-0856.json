Thus, the Imperial Pale Ale (IPA) was born and has gone on to become one of the most popular beer styles in the world.\r\n\r\nOur West Coast-style Jagged Edge IPA recipe takes the hop factor to the next level, perfectly balancing it with hearty English malts to give it the zesty backbone of a bold IPA.
