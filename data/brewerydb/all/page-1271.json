They\u2019re softened by malty undertones.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite everyday beers. First developed in the fall of 1997, we designed Pull Chain to be a well balanced and refreshing. We use a blend of American and English Hops to create a play between hop bitterness and malt flavor. This allows Pull Chain to be paired with with most foods. The simplicity of the mash and the hop additions make the brewing process very easy going, that is, until we get to the dry hopping process. Timing the dry hopping can be tricky. It has to be timed just right to get the maximum aroma from the hops. We extend the post fermentation aging to extract more aroma and flavor from the dry hopping.","abv":"5","ibu":"41","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.053","createDate":"2012-09-09 13:26:22","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:00:33","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},{"id":"XSPtxs","name":"Pullman Palace Car","nameDisplay":"Pullman Palace Car","abv":"6.5","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 13:03:14","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:51","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
