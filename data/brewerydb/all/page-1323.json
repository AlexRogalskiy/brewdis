Mesquite smoked malt from Pilot Malthouse and hops from Big Mitten Hops gave a rich full flavored addition to the beer. Beans went into the beer as it was being brewed to add a wonderfully complex and truly unique mouthfeel. And to top it all off, a subtle dry hopping of chipotle and ancho peppers marry the whole experience.
