If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Following long discussions about attempting our dreams we decided to share our passion and start Pontoon Brewing Company. The \u201cPontoon Lifestyle\u201d came to be as the idea of escaping the daily stresses and relaxing on a pontoon boat. For those unaware, a Pontoon boat is commonly known as a slow moving party platform; it can\u2019t go far and can\u2019t go fast so might as well drink.\r\n \r\nThe Pontoon Brew Crew is currently brewing our beers with our friends and the very talented folks at Thomas Creek Brewery in Greenville, South Carolina with hopes of opening our own brewery in Atlanta, GA in the near future. In the collaborative spirit of home brewing and wanting to develop beer for beer drinkers, we would love to hear your thoughts.","website":"http:\/\/pontoonbrewing.com","mailingListUrl":"info@pontoonbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2W00va\/upload_xalJsF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 14:53:07","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:12:27","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SIL7T6ZP0K","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"S1LjD3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"500, 8601 Dunwoody Pl Suite 500","extendedAddress":"Suite 500","locality":"Sandy Springs","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30350","phone":"(770) 674-1075","website":"http:\/\/www.pontoonbrewing.com","latitude":33.9917909,"longitude":-84.3446985,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-17 15:03:40","updateDate":"2019-05-29 20:07:25","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:30pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:30pm-6:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CTkqqg","name":"Something","nameDisplay":"Something","description":"IPA dry hopped with 007, Azacca and Apollo","abv":"5.5","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-15 19:15:32","updateDate":"2017-12-15 19:36:54","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
