It\u2019s the story of a semi-lost 20 something year old with a young family, who fell in love with the art and science of brewing beer, instead of finishing college, like he was supposed to. He may well still be brewing in his garage at this very moment, if his retired father, Gary had not believed in his son, and offered to join him in business.\r\nGreg, with one small child and another on the way, somehow convinced his wife, Natalia that moving across two states and buying into a failing brewery was a good idea. If nothing else, Greg is persuasive. Three months into the social experiment, Gary, Greg\u2019s dad had the inspired idea to bring in Greg\u2019s good high school friend, Ross as a partner. Granted Ross was an English major (which has nothing to do with beer?), but hey, the guy can talk to anybody.\r\nAnd well, they did what anybody would do in their shoes. Worked all hours of the day for wages below poverty level. Talked to the people, found out what they wanted and made it. Poured beer at festivals all over the state. Shook hands. Begged for placements at bars. Picked up spare change off the sidewalk. Made big mistakes. Figured out how to correct them. Learned a few things the easy way. Learned a lot of things the hard way. And were grateful that at least they had access to nearly free beer.\r\nIn the process of struggling to make something out of very little, they figured out what Iron Horse Brewery really stood for. They weren\u2019t making beer to please the critics of the world, they were making craft beer for people. There are a lot of rules and regulations about how things should be, and when it comes to their beer and their lives, they don\u2019t care about rules.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"aVU96H","name":"517 Pilsner","nameDisplay":"517 Pilsner","description":"Tipping our hat to the hard working men and women in the 517.

Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today\u2019s market, but the goofy and \u201cjust OK\u201d beers that home brewers in the 90\u2019s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we\u2019ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity\u2019s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.\r\n\r\nChris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OdysseyBeerwerks\/app_100265896690345","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:24:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:41:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KFRB2G1TQ7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"I4hZZy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5535 W 56th Ave,","extendedAddress":"Suite 107","locality":"Arvada","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80002","phone":"(303) 421-0772","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","latitude":39.8007911,"longitude":-105.0589359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:42:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SYkdNz","name":"555 IPA","nameDisplay":"555 IPA","description":"A true North American IPA!
