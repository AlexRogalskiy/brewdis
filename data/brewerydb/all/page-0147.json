Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"BCPuYp","name":"Fat Head's Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Fat Head's","description":"Full-scale production brewery offering award-winning beers on tap, tasty grub, guided tours and live entertainment.","website":"http:\/\/www.fatheads.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BCPuYp\/upload_S5Ln9s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:54:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ST92BCAJQ8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"M5VpZt","name":"Cleveland","streetAddress":"24581 Lorain Rd","locality":"North Olmsted","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44070","phone":"(440) 801-1001","website":"http:\/\/fatheads.com\/","latitude":41.426338,"longitude":-81.8942255,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-06-11 14:39:45","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-11:00am-11:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dh7I4h","name":"Saloon","streetAddress":"1805 E Carson St","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15203","phone":"(412) 431-7433","website":"http:\/\/www.fatheadspittsburgh.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon -

In brewing, Saaz usually refers to the hop cultivar traditionally associated with Saaz and Bohemian Pilsner. Although the traditional name for this hop would be Saazer (or Saaz Saazer when grown in the Saaz area), it is generally simply referred to as Saaz or Czech Saaz. zech Saaz is grown not only in ?atec area but also in Tr?ice area (Central Moravia) and ?st? n\/L area (North Bohemia). Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American). True Saaz Saazer hops are prized for their mild, pleasant flavor, and are the only choice for brewing an authentic Pilsner.","countryOfOrigin":"CZ","alphaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMin":3,"betaAcidMax":8,"humuleneMin":15,"humuleneMax":45,"caryophylleneMin":10,"caryophylleneMax":12,"cohumuloneMin":23,"cohumuloneMax":28,"myrceneMin":20,"myrceneMax":40,"farneseneMin":11,"farneseneMax":20,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:29","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:38","country":{"isoCode":"CZ","name":"CZECH REPUBLIC","displayName":"Czech Republic","isoThree":"CZE","numberCode":203,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}],"malt":[{"id":209,"name":"Aromatic Malt","description":"Aromatic malt is a kilned barley malt used to give beer a strong, aggressive malt aroma and rich color.","countryOfOrigin":"BE","srmId":26,"srmPrecise":26,"dryYield":77.9,"potential":1.036,"maxInBatch":100,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"Y","characteristics":[{"id":1,"name":"Aromatic","description":"Imparts an aromatic quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":10,"name":"Malty","description":"Imparts a malty flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:41","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":26,"name":"26","hex":"771900"},"country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":1988,"name":"Carafa Special","category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:08:00"},{"id":429,"name":"Chocolate Malt","description":"A dark malt that gives a rich red or brown color and a nutty flavor, used in brown ales, porters, and some stouts.","countryOfOrigin":"US","srmId":41,"srmPrecise":350,"moistureContent":4,"coarseFineDifference":1.5,"dryYield":60,"potential":1.028,"protein":13.2,"maxInBatch":10,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"N","characteristics":[{"id":6,"name":"Chocolate","description":"Imparts a chocolate quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":7,"name":"Coffee","description":"Imparts a coffee flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":11,"name":"Nutty","description":"Imparts a nutty flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":15,"name":"Toasted","description":"Imparts a toasted flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:47","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":589,"name":"Honey Malt","description":"This Canadian malt imparts a honey-like flavor.

Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

Bainbridge Island Brewing is the island's brewery, and the island is as much a part of us as we are of it.","website":"http:\/\/www.bainbridgebeer.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1KX35c\/upload_yn8mQV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1KX35c\/upload_yn8mQV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1KX35c\/upload_yn8mQV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1KX35c\/upload_yn8mQV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1KX35c\/upload_yn8mQV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-15 03:49:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:41:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"XE83KOCTS1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Oosiqt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9415 Coppertop Lane","extendedAddress":"Suite 103-104","locality":"Bainbridge Island","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98110","phone":"(206) 451.4646","hoursOfOperation":"Tues - Fri: 3:00 - 9:00 pm\r\nSat & Sun: 12:00 - 9:00 pm \r\nMon: Closed for Brew Day","latitude":47.648325,"longitude":-122.525356,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-15 13:15:43","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:48","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-3:00pm-9:00pm,wed-3:00pm-9:00pm,thu-3:00pm-9:00pm,fri-3:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm,sun-12:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tues - Fri: 3:00 - 9:00 pm\r\nSat & Sun: 12:00 - 9:00 pm \r\nMon: Closed for Brew Day","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"21RFtg","name":"Battle Priest","nameDisplay":"Battle Priest","description":"100% Brett fermented in a Pinot Noir barrel and dry hopped liberally.","abv":"7.3","ibu":"52","availableId":2,"styleId":132,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/21RFtg\/upload_6pbTLS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/21RFtg\/upload_6pbTLS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/21RFtg\/upload_6pbTLS-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/21RFtg\/upload_6pbTLS-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/21RFtg\/upload_6pbTLS-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/21RFtg\/upload_6pbTLS-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-08 12:27:21","updateDate":"2017-01-10 21:45:04","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":132,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"iodDki","name":"Three Floyds Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Three Floyds","description":"Three Floyds Brewing Company LLC was founded in 1996 by brothers Nick and Simon with their father Mike Floyd.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3Yd92x","name":"Bauern Bock","nameDisplay":"Bauern Bock","abv":"7.5","styleId":88,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3Yd92x\/upload_ZJRqj8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3Yd92x\/upload_ZJRqj8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3Yd92x\/upload_ZJRqj8-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3Yd92x\/upload_ZJRqj8-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3Yd92x\/upload_ZJRqj8-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/3Yd92x\/upload_ZJRqj8-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-14 14:23:05","updateDate":"2015-12-16 22:50:22","style":{"id":88,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Traditional German-Style Bock","shortName":"Bock","description":"Traditional bocks are made with all malt and are strong, malty, medium- to full-bodied, bottom-fermented beers with moderate hop bitterness that should increase proportionately with the starting gravity.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.
