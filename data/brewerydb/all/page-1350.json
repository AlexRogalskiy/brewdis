The grapes are sorted and destemmed before undergoing cold maceration up to one full day. Fermentation lasts up to seven days at a carefully controlled 62.6\u00b0F, which preserves its fruity aromas. As is traditional in the C\u00f4tes de Provence, each variety is vinified separately and is then blended for ideal balance and character. Grenache lends subtle red fruit, fullness and intensity while Cinsault contributes freshness and balance to the blend.\r\n\r\nBeautiful light rose-salmon color with aromas of ripe tropical fruit, revealing accents of tangerine and hints of ginger.

Paul Cantillon mentions a higher number of bottles of Framboise than of Kriek in his inventory for 1909-1910. During the First World War, the fruit beers disappear from the inventory. From 1922 on, the Kriek will be produced again on a regular basis. As for the Framboise, it was produced for a short time in the thirties and disappeared from the inventory afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, a friend of mine, Willy Gigounon, delivered 150 kgs of raspberries at the brewery. The production of raspberry beers started again 40 years later.\r\n\r\nI was preparing a barrel of raspberry beer. The beer coming out of the small hole in the middle of the stave was marvelous.\r\n\r\n\"It has the colour of onion skin\", said a voice behind me.\r\nIt was Raymond Coumans.\r\nHe was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), \"Raspberry-Lambic\" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a ros\u00e9, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.\r\n\r\nThe process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Ros\u00e9 de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
