Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:12:02","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZUNFMATLEY","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"k70sIR","name":"Smiling Lizard Shandy","nameDisplay":"Smiling Lizard Shandy","abv":"4.2","glasswareId":5,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:14","updateDate":"2015-12-16 11:41:56","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research\/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries. So, not only can we feel good for helping people, you can feel good every time you purchase Thirsty Planet beer.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

Sara had just finished her fifth season of guiding whitewater rafting trips and Jordan had recently passed the Colorado Bar exam. People scoffed. However, for Sara and Jordan the next logical step was to open up a cool wing joint where people could drink cold beer, eat spicy wings, listen to some good music and kick it with their homies. They wanted to open their wing joint in a town that needed great wings and that suited their outdoorsy lifestyles.\r\nAfter some research it became clear that Portland was the ideal place. After moving to Oregon in the fall of 2003, Sara and Jordan scoped out the town, worked hard in local restaurants, and developed their menu for their new restaurant. Neither of them had ever managed a restaurant, let alone owned one. They attended small business meetings, talked to accountants, restaurant owners and local wing connoisseurs. People asked them if Portland was ready for a wing joint. Others suggested they should have stuck with their previous occupations. The naysayers fueled Sara and Jordan's passion for opening their restaurant even more.\r\nOn the first day of 2005, the first customers walked through the doors of Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings. In the early days, there were just a couple cooks and Sara and Jordan were the only front of house staff. Fast forward to 2011 where Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings has become a Portland institution with three restaurants and close to 100 employees. FOTM still possesses the same passion to provide customers with a fun, easygoing restaurant to enjoy our delicious food and great service.","website":"http:\/\/www.portlandwings.com\/index.php","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Yuaxjc\/upload_p5aNEA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Yuaxjc\/upload_p5aNEA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Yuaxjc\/upload_p5aNEA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Yuaxjc\/upload_p5aNEA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Yuaxjc\/upload_p5aNEA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 23:32:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:24:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"OQX2UZCKDE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"zXqAje","name":"Burnside","streetAddress":"1708 E.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:30:29"},"breweries":[{"id":"Y5JQH3","name":"Bank Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Bank","description":"With the construction of our very own brewery in Hendricks, the sun is rising on new opportunities.

Overall balance is a sessionably medium to medium-high assertively oak-smoky malt emphasized beer. Hop flavor is very low to low European noble hop flavor notes. Hop bitterness is medium-low to medium clean hop bitterness. Ale fermentation temperatures are managed to lend a crisp overall flavor impression. Low fruity-ester flavor may be present. Sourness, diacetyl, and DMS should not be perceived on the palate. Grodziskie (also known as Gr\u00e4tzer) is a Polish ale style. Historic versions were most often bottle conditioned to relatively high carbonation levels. Body is low to medium low.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"2.1","abvMax":"2.9","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.028","ogMax":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2013-08-10 12:45:30","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:11:41"},"breweries":[{"id":"FwJ3bJ","name":"Belly Love Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Belly Love","description":"Why Belly Love?\r\n\r\nWell... it's hard to put into words the thoughts that led to the name, because so much of it is simply the feeling you have when you consume a carefully, dare I say lovingly, crafted beer.

This is our Smoked Porter, aged in French oak barrels that were previously used to age Merlot and Pinot Noir. We let the beer age in the barrels for around 12 months before adding a fresh dose of yeast to allow the beer to naturally carbonate in the bottle.\r\n\r\nEnjoy in a wine glass or snifter Smokey and roasty aromas are mixed with aromas of dark fruit, chocolate and a vinous character.
