Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive. To stand out amongst this group, you need to push the envelope and be out there to get to your niche and magic elixir.","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:39:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KY5HWFDR7B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lijo4X","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97225","phone":"503-296-0110","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","latitude":45.485627,"longitude":-122.753996,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"DnQkrw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"939 SE Belmont","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","latitude":45.5166668,"longitude":-122.6560412,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-04 05:03:47","updateDate":"2015-07-07 13:30:30","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5efIdI","name":"Celtic Cream Ale","nameDisplay":"Celtic Cream Ale","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:58","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:45","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-12-14 21:09:31","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JS9DRET054","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lyc9as","name":"Censored (Kronik)","nameDisplay":"Censored (Kronik)","description":"This ale contains no actual copper but we\u2019re pretty literal...

They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place\/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:45:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:04:40","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DYK2HE3MXW","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"hMvwjg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4500 5th Ave South","extendedAddress":"Building C","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"205-578-2616","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","latitude":33.526729,"longitude":-86.764854,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:46:42","updateDate":"2016-02-02 17:43:17","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nixxF8","name":"Centennial Ale","nameDisplay":"Centennial Ale","description":"This Scottish Ale is malty with an amber color.

Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"VqiFsO","name":"Flesk Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Flesk","description":"Brewery and taproom in Barrington.","website":"http:\/\/www.fleskbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqiFsO\/upload_9qLWYl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqiFsO\/upload_9qLWYl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqiFsO\/upload_9qLWYl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqiFsO\/upload_9qLWYl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqiFsO\/upload_9qLWYl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-14 19:22:12","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:50:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0T9ZDO5MIQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"psqOr9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 Applebee St","extendedAddress":"Suite E","locality":"Barrington","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60010","phone":"(630) 233-4997","website":"http:\/\/www.fleskbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1560261,"longitude":-88.1394403,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-14 19:22:47","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:33:28","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SGbBC5","name":"Centennial Ale","nameDisplay":"Centennial Ale","description":"There \u00eds nothing traditional about this traditional Indian Pale Ale.

Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"q6vJUK","name":"Oskar Blues Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Oskar Blues","description":"Oskar Blues Brewery is part of the Oskar Blues Grill and Brew restaurant and was located in Lyons, Colorado, near the city of Boulder. The brewery is now in Longmont, CO - a much larger town just east of Lyons. Oskar Blues is unique in that it serves craft-brewed beer in cans, contrary to the normal practice of bottling micro brews. The brewery is owned by Dale Katechis, a native of Florence, Alabama who brought canned beer and southern fried foods together for an interesting twist on the micro-brew pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/q6vJUK\/upload_cUkek0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2019-10-11 21:00:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jnSdDd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 Pike Rd","extendedAddress":"Unit B","locality":"Longmont","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80501","phone":"1-303-776-1914","website":"http:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/","latitude":40.1389968,"longitude":-105.1227417,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:46:27","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"I1q8kK","name":"Brevard","streetAddress":"342 Mountain Industrial Dr.","locality":"Brevard","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28712","phone":"(828) 883-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room\r\nMonday-Sunday: 12pm-8pm\r\n\r\nFree Brewery Tours\r\nMonday-Thursday: 4pm\r\nFriday-Sunday: 2pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm","latitude":35.2534666,"longitude":-82.706852,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-13 15:22:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tasting Room\r\nMonday-Sunday: 12pm-8pm\r\n\r\nFree Brewery Tours\r\nMonday-Thursday: 4pm\r\nFriday-Sunday: 2pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"TkDbDx","name":"Oskar Blues","streetAddress":"10420 Metric Blvd","extendedAddress":"#150","locality":"Austin","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78758","phone":"(512) 243-7054","website":"https:\/\/www.oskarblues.com\/brewery\/austin","hoursOfOperation":"Mon -
