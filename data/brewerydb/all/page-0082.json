Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ye4Xxf","name":"Anger Management","nameDisplay":"Anger Management","abv":"8.8","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:59:25","updateDate":"2015-11-30 20:59:25","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

Continuing the tradition of Michigan and Craft brewers before us, we will create unique hand crafted Ales and Lagers, that will challenge expectations and ideas of what great beer really is. With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.\r\n\r\nMade in Michigan and the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOne of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn\u2019t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s All About the Beer!\r\n\r\nWe are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried. We are also going to push the envelope and make beers with unique and far-out ingredients that will invite you to be different and maybe live a little on the edge.

In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.","website":"http:\/\/rahrbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:03:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IJ7AKS9UVG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"X6U0o8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 Galveston Avenue","locality":"Fort Worth","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76104","phone":"817-810-9266","website":"http:\/\/www.rahrbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm","latitude":32.7368128,"longitude":-97.3275585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-10-29 16:04:43","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"11rElm","name":"Angry Gourd","nameDisplay":"Angry Gourd","abv":"6.4","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-10 15:28:13","updateDate":"2015-12-10 15:28:13","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

We don\u2019t filter the Angry Monk, nor any of our other Belgian-style beers, however, one distinguishing characteristic of this particular yeast strain is that it is highly flocculating which means it leaves the beer very clear and bright without sacrificing any flavors.","abv":"6.8","ibu":"30","styleId":70,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.067","createDate":"2014-09-17 22:39:52","updateDate":"2014-09-18 13:48:05","style":{"id":70,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","shortName":"Belgian Ale","description":"Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:15:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MPZR37EQWD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"f6s8OH","name":"Angry Rabbit Mountain","nameDisplay":"Angry Rabbit Mountain","description":"Our attempts to rebrew our first Rabbit Mtn Red went awry\u2026and you get to enjoy the results!

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"qoKaji","name":"Phantom Carriage","nameShortDisplay":"Phantom Carriage","description":"Part brewery, part cafe \u2014 and part haunted cellar \u2014 Phantom Carriage is now open in Carson. And like so many other craft brewery tasting rooms, Phantom Carriage occupies a commercial\/industrial building, this one among the confluence of the 405, 110 and 91 freeways, just a few blocks from the home of the Goodyear blimp.\r\n\r\nBut unlike other brewery tasting rooms with sparse decor and little style, Phantom Carriage drips with atmosphere. \r\n\r\nConceived by beer industry veteran (and self-proclaimed beer geek) Martin Svab as a Belgian beer cafe, the project grew when Simon Ford \u2014 a skilled and decorated homebrewer known on the Los Angeles scene for his downright fantastic sour beers \u2014 signed on. The \u201csmall-batch beer endeavor\u201d launched, relying on other local breweries (chiefly Monkish Brewing in Torrance) for production capacity and storage space.\r\n\r\ncComments\r\nGot something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment.\r\nADD A COMMENT\r\n0\r\n\r\nAfter a favorable reception for the first beer -- a wild Belgian ale that found the sweet spot between tart, dry and funky -- the partners redoubled their efforts to find a local space to house the brewery. Carson welcomed the team with open arms, and a comparatively streamlined bureaucracy. \r\n\r\nThe 7,000-square-foot location now houses a tasting room, a small pilot-batch brewhouse, a screening room where Svab hopes to both show his beloved classic horror films and conduct beer education classes, a kitchen focused on sandwiches and small plates.\r\n\r\nAlso, and most importantly, on premises: over 500 oak barrels previously used by wine and spirit producers. It\u2019s the barrels that set Phantom Carriage apart, as the brewery will focus on wild, wood-aged, and sour beers. \r\n\r\nThe brewery took its name from a 1921 Swedish horror film, and the house beers are often named after the luminaries of that age of cinema.\r\n\r\nOn a recent visit during the soft opening, the tasting rooms was comfortably full and three house beers were available (alongside a well-curated guest tap list and a drool-worthy bottle list).\r\n\r\nOude Muis is an aged version of the primogenitor brew, Cushing a potent golden sour ale that balanced a bracing tartness with a twang of funk, and Rathbone is a dark sour ale that added some fruitiness and a pleasant burnt-sugar sweetness. The latter was a particularly fitting match to the deeply hickory smoked brisket served simply on a baguette with au jus. Cold-brewed coffee is available on tap alongside the dozen beer taps, and there\u2019s a small selection of wine and cocktails (Spanish-style charcuterie will also soon join the menu items). \r\n\r\nArticle written by: JOHN VERIVE of the Los Angeles Times","website":"http:\/\/www.phantomcarriage.com","established":"2012","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/baXonz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qoKaji\/upload_S0Oj3n-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qoKaji\/upload_S0Oj3n-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qoKaji\/upload_S0Oj3n-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qoKaji\/upload_S0Oj3n-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qoKaji\/upload_S0Oj3n-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 19:36:31","updateDate":"2019-09-30 10:08:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"AT9RPYHMUF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"47xCEj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"18525 S.

More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few.

These ales have a medium hop bitterness and flavor. They often don't have hop aroma. Irish-style red ales have low to medium candy-like caramel malt sweetness and may have a balanced subtle degree of roast barley or roast malt character and complexity.  Irish-style Red Ales have a medium body. The style may have low levels of fruity-ester flavor and aroma. Diacetyl should be absent or at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Slight yeast haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"28","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"4.5","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:23:38"},"breweries":[{"id":"Q1XVjK","name":"Iso-Kallan Panimo","nameShortDisplay":"Iso-Kallan Panimo","description":"Iso-Kallan Panimo was established on 1 October 2013 in connection with our family farm in Pielavesi, Vaaraslahti. Our goal is to improve the domestic beverage culture by offering beers, ciders and lemonades made of the best and clean raw materials.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2014, when we hit a cramped spot, we decided to change the production of beer to a somewhat heavier farm in Levy, Kuopio. At least so far, lemonade production will remain in Pielavesi.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located in the heart of Savo and the annual capacity is about 40 000L. Under the Savo series, we produce traditional unfiltered full grain crates, making raw materials the best in their rights. The most varied season and theme cell is complemented by the Savo series in the permanent range. Thanks to our small and flexible production, we can offer fast-changing products and make beers also custom-made.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-05-18 15:47:33","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ijqduE","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"Kis\u00e4llinkuja 7","locality":"Kuopio","postalCode":"70780","latitude":62.8636315,"longitude":27.6241235,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-26 14:59:45","updateDate":"2017-08-29 14:30:42","timezoneId":"Europe\/Helsinki","country":{"isoCode":"FI","name":"FINLAND","displayName":"Finland","isoThree":"FIN","numberCode":246,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
