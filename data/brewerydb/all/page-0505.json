There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d. So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/goT5b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-12-14 20:48:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"xoGGQz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"437 Dimmocks Mill Road","extendedAddress":"Suite 41","locality":"Hillsborough","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27278","phone":"919-697-8379","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Brewery open for public tours Saturday afternoon from 12.30pm until 4.30pm.

With its high elevation and cool evening temperatures,the area is known for its high quality wheat and malting barley. After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby \u2013 brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients. Owners Barry and Chris Hedrich and their basset hounds Stanley and Leroy look forward to seeing you in beautiful White Sulphur Springs.","website":"http:\/\/2bassetbrewery.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-04 22:12:40","updateDate":"2019-06-11 13:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VQBL3H4K0E","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Uc8Jz7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"202 Main Street","locality":"White Sulphur Springs","region":"Montana","phone":"(406) 547-2337","latitude":46.54816,"longitude":-110.9010709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-05 17:46:39","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:04:05","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"f1NWG2","name":"Drop Anchor IPA","nameDisplay":"Drop Anchor IPA","description":"Featuring Citra hops, light in body with a beautiful sunny color.

Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, \u201cWhat do you really want to do in life\u2026(when you grow up)?\u201d  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.\r\n\r\nTheir first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff\u2019s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.\r\n\r\nThey evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc\u2026) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult. \r\n\r\nOur roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.  We want to create a place to showpiece our beers, invite your friends and families, and for you all to have a great time.\r\n\r\nThe Salish Sea Brewing Company is the real deal!\r\n\r\nWe have three 10bbl fermenters in place, the 10bbl bright tank, kettle, and mash up and running!

I don't know that we recognized at the time that it was a life altering event; but, mostly out of desire to have more mead in our lives that measured up to the quality we had experienced from them we decided to start making our own.  Having no local meadmakers to draw from, this gave us the luxury of being unafraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients not associated with meads.  Some experiments failed and others worked great, all had a powerful influence on how we saw mead and what we thought mead could be.\r\nLike any hobby we dove face first into meadmaking.  Our goal was simple, to create memorable experiences through mead using locally produced ingredients to the extent possible.  Soon we were sharing those meads with friends and they shared them with others. I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

It is medium bodied with an almost creamy mouthfeel and a subtle, thirst quenching bitterness. Hefty dry hopping with Australian and US hops add citrus, melon and stonefruit juiciness with a little resinous pine along the ride.

A sea change and love for beer prompted Chris & Gab Moore to assemble East Gippsland\u2019s newest brewery in the abandoned 1893 Orbost Butter and Produce factory \u2013 not far from where Gabs grew up. The pair lives with their two children on a family farm at Point Ricardo on the coast, and source buckets of inspiration from their surroundings. Their beers are shaped by the ever-present coastal elements that dominate life here and rooted in the farms and plains where the Snowy River meets the sea. Sailor\u2019s Grave will make the most of the bountiful land around where they live and work, by incorporating indigenous botanicals picked in the bush, salt, weed, and sea life harvested from river and ocean, fruits, grains & produce from local farms & orchards and wild yeasts from their backyard. Chris and Gab plan to keep the beers approachable even when they get adventurous. The pair have big plans for an array of limited edition seasonally inspired beers.
