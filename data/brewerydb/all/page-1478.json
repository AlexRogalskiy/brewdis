More modern versions of this beer incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to a perception of smoothness. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in barely perceptible amounts, but this is not common. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

The concept stems from our desire to combine premium quality beer, a cozy space, and change. Prior to opening the doors at Alternation, I meticulously brewed at home, utilizing a bevy of different ingredients, never focusing on the same styles. At some point, I humbly (and delightedly) came to the realization that the art of craft beer came naturally to me. Over the course of 7 years, with a tool chest of styles and ingredients under my belt, brewing became my life, life became an experiment, the art of experiment became fun. The bustling craft beer canvas in Denver, CO only provided further incentive. Our minds were made up, we were going to open a brewery. However, would it be possible to open a commercial brewery with a beating pulse? A brewery that was as living and vibrant as the customers who walk through the doors? All while keeping quality and experimentation in the forefront? Well, the answer is YES. \r\nIn December 2017, our ideas of quality and experimentation came to life; Alternation is a bustling brewery on S. Broadway in Denver, CO. Our 3 BBL brewhouse (93 gallons) gives us the opportunity to brew whatever we want, whenever we want. Our hands-on, individualized, and knowledgeable approach to each recipe allows us to maintain premium quality throughout the process. You will see everything from refreshing pilsners and hazy wheats to funky sours and oak-aged imperial stouts. We won't say that flagship beers are completely out of the question (we love to bring things back), but brewing the same thing over and over doesn't sound very fun. Each batch is hand-crafted by our owners with love and beer desires in mind. We have the unique ability to cut on an operational dime; giving us the ability to keep up with current trends, utilize old world nuances, and create an opportunity for customers to experience a little bit of everything, while maintaining the finest of quality in each small-batch.\r\nOur goal is to give beer lovers the opportunity to enjoy the diversity of the evolving beer industry and recognize that beer should not always be classified into homogenous BJCP styles.  For the novice, we hope to offer something refreshing and a friendly environment to relax and ask questions. For the connoisseur, we hope to question their beer mind and earn their respect.  For everyone, we hope to offer an experience unlike any other brewery: a chance to walk in to a completely different menu, each time they enter.","website":"http:\/\/www.alternationbrewing.com","established":"2017","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/P2EJVh\/upload_BqFcdR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/P2EJVh\/upload_BqFcdR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/P2EJVh\/upload_BqFcdR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/P2EJVh\/upload_BqFcdR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/P2EJVh\/upload_BqFcdR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-05 22:51:55","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:26:28","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"XMZPBKYNT2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SN3Mpk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1539 S Broadway","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80210","phone":"(303) 802-5340","latitude":39.688657,"longitude":-104.987895,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-06 14:21:53","updateDate":"2018-06-06 14:21:53","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IRzgFO","name":"Solo Flight American Brown","nameDisplay":"Solo Flight American Brown","abv":"6","ibu":"38","availableId":1,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-22 15:17:58","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:31:57","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado.

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

Now a decade and a half later, armed with solid experience, the breadth of our creative momentum continues to grow and we are releasing at least one new cider a month. \r\n\r\nThis year has been the year we decided to let the fantastic Moutere terroir shine through unhindered and we have ditched the packets of commercial yeasts.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to explore what cider can be. The possibilities are endless.","website":"https:\/\/www.peckhams.co.nz\/about","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/73xdsm\/upload_TCtDhh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-27 20:33:37","updateDate":"2019-08-23 10:42:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0XNcUK","name":"Peckham's Cidery and Orchard","streetAddress":"127 Neudorf Road","region":"Upper Moutere","postalCode":"7175","latitude":-41.248697,"longitude":172.9931881,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-27 20:37:07","updateDate":"2018-06-27 20:37:30","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VT5TEr","name":"Solstice Fruitcake Stout","nameDisplay":"Solstice Fruitcake Stout","glasswareId":5,"styleId":20,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-10 15:44:41","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:46","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

The first batch of Berghoff beer was brewed in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1887 by Herman Berghoff and his three brothers. Herman\u2019s desire to expand the market for the family\u2019s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           \r\n\r\n   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff\u2019s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.","website":"http:\/\/berghoffbeer.com\/","established":"1887","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:24:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kU9sBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3122 W.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"05TKRd","name":"Fat Orange Cat Brew Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Fat Orange Cat Brew Co.","description":"A small seasonal farm brewery in East Hampton, CT.","website":"https:\/\/fatorangecatbrewco.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/05TKRd\/upload_y450p2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/05TKRd\/upload_y450p2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/05TKRd\/upload_y450p2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/05TKRd\/upload_y450p2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/05TKRd\/upload_y450p2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-03-13 23:57:50","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:05:01","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QAITS9C8XG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"oHbFpl","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"47 Tartia Road","locality":"East Hampton","region":"Connecticut","latitude":41.5595334,"longitude":-72.4717504,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-05-05 15:04:05","updateDate":"2017-07-05 20:30:56","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1mRL8J","name":"Somer Orange Honey Ale","nameDisplay":"Somer Orange Honey Ale","description":"This unfiltered beer has flavors of orange and honey with a nice medium-sweet malt character.\r\n\r\nSomer Orange Honey Ale is new to Rogue\u2019s award-winning brews bringing with it an easy, year round drinkability.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"X0l98q","name":"Rogue Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Rogue Ales","description":"Rogue Ales & Spirits is an agri-fermenter founded in Oregon in 1988 as one of America\u2019s first microbreweries.
