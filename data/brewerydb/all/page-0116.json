This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Avery Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Avery","description":"A Colorado-based brewery for over 25 years, Avery Brewing has a singular focus on creating the perfect beer.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.

After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients. Owners Barry and Chris Hedrich and their basset hounds Stanley and Leroy look forward to seeing you in beautiful White Sulphur Springs.","website":"http:\/\/2bassetbrewery.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/qfGVU4\/upload_6CGM2H-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-04 22:12:40","updateDate":"2019-06-11 13:23:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VQBL3H4K0E","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Uc8Jz7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"202 Main Street","locality":"White Sulphur Springs","region":"Montana","phone":"(406) 547-2337","latitude":46.54816,"longitude":-110.9010709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-05 17:46:39","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:04:05","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hPIJ80","name":"Bada Bing Cherry Porter","nameDisplay":"Bada Bing Cherry Porter","abv":"5.4","availableId":4,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 21:41:01","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:00:19","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"iHSZ6p","name":"Up Front Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Up Front","description":"UP FRONT BREWING was founded in Glasgow in 2015 by a one man gypsy brewer, a homebrewer turned pro, with the aim of sharing his love of exceptional beers","website":"http:\/\/www.upfrontbrewing.com\/beer\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iHSZ6p\/upload_KjOoje-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iHSZ6p\/upload_KjOoje-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iHSZ6p\/upload_KjOoje-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iHSZ6p\/upload_KjOoje-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iHSZ6p\/upload_KjOoje-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-19 02:07:41","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"p4V9DO","name":"Main Location","locality":"Glasgow","region":"Scotland","latitude":55.864237,"longitude":-4.251806,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-10-19 02:10:26","updateDate":"2017-10-19 02:10:26","timezoneId":"Europe\/London","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"P2fWtB","name":"Badass Pear Cider","nameDisplay":"Badass Pear Cider","abv":"5.5","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-12 13:34:04","updateDate":"2015-03-12 19:39:54","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.
