Thus, Harvest Moon Brewing set up operations in Belt, a rural community located 20 miles southeast of Great Falls.  Harvest Moon's first batches were available in late 1997.  Soon after, the brewery developed a reputation for a well-balanced, full-bodied beer that only quality ingredients in perfect amounts could produce.  The barley is grown and malted just a few miles from the brewery while the malted wheat and hops come from the Northwest. \r\n\r\nThe brewery uses modern, state-of-the-art brewing equipment but is still a \"hands-on\" system, which allows brewery owners Stan and John to ensure high production quality.  They oversee every step of the process, from malt handling to mashing, from wort transfer to yeast pitching, from fermentation to conditioning, and from packaging to shipping.  The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans. Harvest Moon Brewing Company calls Belt home and has named their wheat, Belgian-style ale, Beltian White, after the town.\r\n\r\nBelt is also strategically located above one of the purest sources of water. Wells tap into the Madison Formation where constant year-round temperature and quality allow Harvest Moon to use some of the most perfect water on Earth to brew beer.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing about Belt? They are located in the center of our great state, right in the middle of the grain-growers that supply our brewery with prime barley & wheat. Harvest Moon\u2019s ties to the farming community don\u2019t end there\u2026after we use the grains, we supply the spent mash to a local pig farmer to feed his hogs. Hence the name, Pigs Ass Porter.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers.

In addition to the above brands Pivovarna La\u0161ko also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target population.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions Pivovarna La\u0161ko brews unique beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna La\u0161ko entered an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand name iC Cider.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDespite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna La\u0161ko, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nThe Pivovarna La\u0161ko Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, and syrups for the productions of drinks, and also a newspaper and publishing activity.","website":"http:\/\/www.pivo-lasko.si\/","established":"1825","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-01 18:53:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"8C6fp0","name":"Pivovarna La\u0161ko","streetAddress":"Trubarjeva ulica 28","locality":"La\u0161ko","postalCode":"`````","phone":"+386 3 734 80 00","website":"http:\/\/www.pivo-lasko.si\/","latitude":50.593349,"longitude":23.23594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"SI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-01 18:58:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"SI","name":"SLOVENIA","displayName":"Slovenia","isoThree":"SVN","numberCode":705,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6rzYQG","name":"Eliot IPA","nameDisplay":"Eliot IPA","description":"A tribute to our wonderful neighborhood, this IPA is full of tropical fruit flavors and aroma, and dry hopped with Galaxy, Citra, Centennial & Simcoe.","abv":"6.6","ibu":"65","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6rzYQG\/upload_va6GEY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6rzYQG\/upload_va6GEY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6rzYQG\/upload_va6GEY-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6rzYQG\/upload_va6GEY-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6rzYQG\/upload_va6GEY-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/6rzYQG\/upload_va6GEY-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-14 18:37:05","updateDate":"2016-05-18 10:02:06","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
