Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview Commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatdanepub.com\/","established":"1996","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.greatdanepub.com\/email-list-signup","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:25:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VRLWXMIU17","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"IdIInN","name":"Fitchburg","streetAddress":"2980 Cahill Main","locality":"Fitchburg","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53711","phone":"608-442-9000","website":"http:\/\/fitchburg.greatdanepub.com\/","latitude":43.017826,"longitude":-89.4233126,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-06-19 16:32:42","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ux16wo","name":"Downtown","streetAddress":"123 E.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

The beer's name was changed in 1962, not in response to a challenge from the Steinecker company, but to distinguish it from Heineken.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Steinlager was launched in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.","website":"http:\/\/www.steinlager.com\/","established":"1957","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:27:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"v8SqHO","name":"Lion Brewery","streetAddress":"55 Ormiston Road","extendedAddress":"Flatbush","locality":"Auckland","website":"http:\/\/www.steinlager.co.nz\/","latitude":-36.9634165,"longitude":174.895644,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-27 01:47:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"b89PsP","name":"Sp\u00e9irbhean","nameDisplay":"Sp\u00e9irbhean","description":"Sp\u00e9irbhean (spare-van) literally translates as; a woman as beautiful as the whole sky.
