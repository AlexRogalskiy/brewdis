We are committed to crafting great hard cider made from fresh pressed Midwestern fruit, never concentrate.\r\n\r\nBrick River Cider is named to honor the connection between the City of St Louis and its connection to the regional rural communities.  From its early days St Louis was a major source of brick making, and the rivers carried those bricks in every direction building communities throughout our region.  Those bricks remind us that we are all connected, and we continue that tradition today bringing the fruits of the region back to the city, and crafting authentic hard ciders to celebrate with our friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe story of connections flowing back and forth with St Louis and the wider region has repeated again and again across countless families and generations.  Brick River founder Russ John\u2019s family got its start in America when his great grandfather Theodore enlisted in the Union Cavalry in 1862 at Jefferson Barracks, St Louis.  In 1869 Theodore established a homestead farm and orchards in southeast Nebraska, and the John family has been growing apples in the Midwest ever since.  Today his great grandson is proud to bring a family tradition of hard cider back to St Louis with the city\u2019s first dedicated ciderworks.\r\n\r\nBrick River Cider Company\u2019s mission is to work with regional fruit growers to craft authentic hard cider using only fresh pressed fruit juices.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com. Becky worked with Chatham Hill Winery for 2 years learning tasting room and wine club management.

In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.

Another advantage of being small is that we can produce a wide variety of styles so our selection will always be changing. We will produce beers that fit the season and year round classics. Loe's Brewing takes pride in producing the finest handcrafted beers, and we are sure that once you try our beer you will agree that bigger is not always better , and will notice the difference that craft beer has to offer.  Cheers- The Loe's Brewing Team","website":"http:\/\/www.loesbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SHa2O7\/upload_SmibiI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SHa2O7\/upload_SmibiI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SHa2O7\/upload_SmibiI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SHa2O7\/upload_SmibiI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/SHa2O7\/upload_SmibiI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FmWw3u","name":"Hickory","streetAddress":"2033 North Center St","locality":"Hickory","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28601","phone":"828-781-5761","website":"http:\/\/www.loesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Our taproom hours will be Fri, Sat, Sun  2pm -10pm.

Are you asking yourself, \u201cWhat the hell are they talking about?\u201d\r\n\r\nprocessIt goes like this. British monks loved to put their bald heads together, eat gruel and make killer good beer. Let\u2019s face it. This was the Middle Ages, the insulation in those drafty monasteries sucked, so beer making kept them busy, and after a few pints, who gave a damn about the cold.\r\n\r\nBut these dudes were on to something. Using only barley, wheat, hops and pure water and being tight-assed about things like purity (they were monks after-all), they developed a system for making beer that has stood the test of time. And you thought ancient purity laws has something to do with chastity.\r\n\r\nThat same British monk-inspired beer yeast begat yeast off-spring. It is from this very same yeast that we make our beers. How\u2019s that for a DNA profile?\r\n\r\nBut we\u2019ve taken things a step further. We use the Peter Austin Brick Kettle Brewing System. For you non-beer geeks Peter Austin was The Granddaddy High Brew Master of Microbrewing. This was the man who started it all.\r\n\r\nThe Peter Austin system is a direct-fired, brick clad, copper whirlpool and hop percolator, and you cannot buy it at Costco when you get a Vitamix. The Austin system is a rugged, reliable and easy to operate, clean and maintain.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 100 Peter Austin Brewing Systems installed worldwide, but Four Mile Brewery is the only brewery in Western North America using his system.\r\n\r\nAlthough Peter Austin has left this mortal coil for a beer garden in the sky, his gifted prot\u00e9g\u00e9 carries on his vision.\r\n\r\nAlan Pugsley is our Brew Master at Four Mile. Pugsley is not just our brew master. He travels around waving his frothy magic wand amongst all his other projects around the world. What is distinctive to Alan\u2019s process is his know-how when developing beer recipes. His recipes honour true British beer making while masterfully tweaking things to incorporate regional ingredients while developing taste profiles that appeal to local palates.\r\n\r\nAs Peter Austin taught Alan Pugsley, so too did Pugsley teach our own resident brewer, Doug White. White is part of the family clan at Four Mile. In 1985 he headed off on a beer quest walk-about.\r\n\r\nHe got as far as England, Ringwood Brewery and Alan Pugsley. He apprenticed with them, and then, upon his return, took further training the University of California, David Campus, in brewing sciences. For White, craft brewing is a hands-on art form, and the proof, dear drinker, can be worshipped from dainty sip to gusto guzzle.","website":"http:\/\/www.4milebrewingco.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GSkOGp\/upload_XzTGhh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GSkOGp\/upload_XzTGhh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GSkOGp\/upload_XzTGhh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GSkOGp\/upload_XzTGhh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GSkOGp\/upload_XzTGhh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-10 03:06:20","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"E8QMCs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"199 Island Highway","locality":"Victoria","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"BC V9B 1G1","phone":"+1 250-479-3346","latitude":48.4526413,"longitude":-123.4345587,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-11 03:32:14","updateDate":"2015-11-20 16:09:42","timezoneId":"America\/Vancouver","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dd0B8k","name":"Sweet Potato Pale","nameDisplay":"Sweet Potato Pale","description":"A traditional English bitter but brewed with sweet potatoes, nutmeg, and cinnamon.
