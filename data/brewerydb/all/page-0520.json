Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

When creativity, aspirations, and equipment got a little too large for our tiny garages the inevitable craft brewery was born. We continue to be grounded in family, friends, beer education, and the quest for the ever perfect pint. We focus on the range of flavors beer can provide, and offer an ever-changing variety of styles in our brewpub.

We all come from different backgrounds - Adam, business & brewing; Walt, design & photography; Q, pharmacist and homebrewing; Jamie, production brewing; Gus, basset hound--but we're brought together through our dedication and commitment to the craft of producing championship quality craft beer.\r\n\r\nAlumni of Ohio State, Adam and Walt always dreamed of returning to Columbus to build something of their own. Before coming home to Ohio, the seed of what would become a 2,500BBL capacity brewing facility was planted in a tiny carriage-house apartment on the west-side of Chicago. To test the viability of what was then called Oval Brewing, we launched and successfully completed a Kickstarter Campaign in 2012, allowing us to tackle this thing right.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still one of our favorite beers.\r\n\r\nNow several years later we're distributing to three states and cranking out the same great  beers, along with many great additions, on a 15bbl brewhouse. Stop in any one of our now three retail locations here in Sawyer and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:39:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"U48KIM23DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","latitude":41.885905,"longitude":-86.594458,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2017-06-22 15:26:06","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sunday - Thursday: 11-10\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11-11","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"W7IdgU","name":"D\u017eungle Pilsner","nameDisplay":"D\u017eungle Pilsner","abv":"4.4","styleId":76,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-05 19:17:12","updateDate":"2018-09-05 19:17:12","style":{"id":76,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bohemian-Style Pilsener","shortName":"Bohemian Pilsener","description":"Traditional Bohemian Pilseners are medium bodied, and they can be as dark as a light amber color.

Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:10:42"},"breweries":[{"id":"MZZWAT","name":"Evil Twin Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Evil Twin","description":"We Have all good intentions to disturb, disorder and enlighten you with unforgettable beer after beer.\r\n\r\nBecause We are so much in love with good taste, all the beers from Evil Twin are prepared in 10 of the best breweries around the world.
