The distinctive smoked character, courtesy of wood-fire kilned malts in the recipe, is balanced by rich, malty sweetness. Our friend Thomas at Weyermann Malts in Bamberg, Germany custom-designed the malt profile for this recipe (over breakfast no less!), and we brewed it in tribute to our close ties with them.\r\nHISTORY & STYLE\r\n\r\nRauchbier is a beer style originating in the region of Franconia in Germany. The unique feature of this style is that the malt has been kilned over wood fire (typically beechwood). As a result of this process the malt imparts a pungent smoky character to the beer.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES\r\n\r\nThe first impression of Rauchstack is undoubtedly its rich, smoky aroma. The body is luscious and the flavour echoes the smoky scent, giving the sense of a beer that could almost be a meal. The smoke is balanced by malty sweetness. The finish is clean, with some lingering whiffs of smoke.","abv":"6.9","ibu":"36","availableId":2,"styleId":129,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/poyp8r\/upload_oWZRRE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/poyp8r\/upload_oWZRRE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/poyp8r\/upload_oWZRRE-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/poyp8r\/upload_oWZRRE-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/poyp8r\/upload_oWZRRE-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/poyp8r\/upload_oWZRRE-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Rauchstack is a perfect accompaniment to virtually all smoked foods.

Black to very deep ruby\/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"}},{"id":"SucfTt","name":"Ravena","nameDisplay":"Ravena","abv":"6.2","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-10 17:23:08","updateDate":"2016-09-16 19:06:26","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"}},{"id":"dBZfql","name":"Ray John","nameDisplay":"Ray John","abv":"6.8","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-03 12:54:10","updateDate":"2015-05-03 12:54:11","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
