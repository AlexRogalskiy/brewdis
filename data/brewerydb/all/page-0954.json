The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Not a beer for the timid, La Folie is a sour delight that will turn your tongue on its head.","abv":"7","ibu":"18","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","beerVariationId":"JeH6oB","year":2014,"labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DAHhL6\/upload_bhnwqO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DAHhL6\/upload_bhnwqO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DAHhL6\/upload_bhnwqO-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DAHhL6\/upload_bhnwqO-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DAHhL6\/upload_bhnwqO-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DAHhL6\/upload_bhnwqO-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-25 12:41:11","updateDate":"2019-08-04 13:27:22","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"beerVariation":{"id":"JeH6oB","name":"La Folie - Lips of Faith","nameDisplay":"La Folie - Lips of Faith","abv":"6","ibu":"18","styleId":57,"isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:34","updateDate":"2019-08-04 13:11:11","style":{"id":57,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Flanders Oud Bruin or Oud Red Ales","shortName":"Flanders Red","description":"This light- to medium-bodied deep copper to brown ale is characterized by a slight to strong lactic sourness, and with \"Reds\" sometimes a balanced degree of acetic acid.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"}},{"id":"Qxfspo","name":"Liquid Chords","nameDisplay":"Liquid Chords","description":"Brown ale w\/ vanilla beans and cacao nibs on NITRO","abv":"6.6","ibu":"18","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qxfspo\/upload_4EFQ5A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qxfspo\/upload_4EFQ5A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qxfspo\/upload_4EFQ5A-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qxfspo\/upload_4EFQ5A-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qxfspo\/upload_4EFQ5A-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Qxfspo\/upload_4EFQ5A-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-12-11 06:05:47","updateDate":"2017-09-21 13:10:12","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

We\u2019ve taken all the ingredients that make up the classic mass-produced malt liquors \u2013 barley, rice, & corn \u2013 and elevated the recipe to produce a premium imperial lager truly worth savoring.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"55","availableId":2,"styleId":93,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DeYLm7\/upload_HSfZfX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DeYLm7\/upload_HSfZfX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DeYLm7\/upload_HSfZfX-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DeYLm7\/upload_HSfZfX-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DeYLm7\/upload_HSfZfX-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/DeYLm7\/upload_HSfZfX-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-26 19:25:43","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:31:07","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.
