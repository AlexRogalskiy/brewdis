Of course we have selected the perfect aroma German variety - Hallertau Mittelfruh - which added to the brewing kettle during boiling as well as to the fermentation tank later for dry hopping. This hop gives a beautiful flower flavours to our beer. Finally, this beer is a bit more stronger that usual one in this style. We suppose that it would be a plus only for the late Russian autumn.

Since 1810, this celebration of good food, good company, and, most importantly, good beer, has most prominently featured Marzen-style lager\u2013so much so that many refer to the beer simply as Oktoberfest.\r\n\r\nOur Oktoberfest is a traditional Bavarian lager featuring all-German malts and rare German hops. This dedication to authenticity produces a beer that would be as at home in Munich as it is here in the Midwest United States. The aroma is authentic, the taste sweet and malty, and the finish crisp and hoppy; perfect for a beautiful fall day!","abv":"6.5","ibu":"16.5","glasswareId":3,"srmId":7,"availableId":4,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vIikZV\/upload_GUpa5s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vIikZV\/upload_GUpa5s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vIikZV\/upload_GUpa5s-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vIikZV\/upload_GUpa5s-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vIikZV\/upload_GUpa5s-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/vIikZV\/upload_GUpa5s-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:50","updateDate":"2015-12-16 07:17:04","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":7,"name":"7","hex":"F39C00"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.
