A saying goes in wine making, \"it takes a lot of good beer to make good wine...\". The point being, we make complex, delicate, nuanced beers, not just the same typical west coast hop bombs or dark extremely high alcohol brews (though we make quality versions of those too). Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only \"The people's beverage\", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA.

Their primary goal is to serve the immediate local market with fresh flavoursome beer.\r\n\r\nThe brewery has been a long time in the making, stemming from a long passion for beer and many years of home brewing. Fitzy started out brewing his first beer back in 1987 as a 16 year old. It was a Muntons \u2013 English Mild that seeded the journey many moons ago\u2026 in an era where good ingredients and quality information were very hard to obtain \u2013 oh how different it is today.\r\n\r\nHaving become lost in the wilderness for several years, the passion for great beer and brewing was rekindled when working with some like minded individuals circa 2001 at Unisys in Wellington. They would knock off at 4.30pm and have regular Friday afternoon beer tasting sessions, blind critiquing whatever was brought in, including their own special brews. Needless to say there was a great deal of heated discussion regarding the qualities or faults of each particular beer.\r\n\r\nThe passion for great tasting beer grew to such an extent that when the Fitzpatrick family moved to Tauranga in 2003, a \u201cbrewery space\u201d was added to the new shed plans, for that \u2018one day dream\u2019. Ten years later, with the help of wife Catherine, that dream is a reality.","website":"http:\/\/fitzpatricksbrewing.co.nz","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/h3MPyG\/upload_1vOhYa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:45:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MhuHRk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"19 Keenan Road","locality":"Pyes PA","region":"Tauranga","postalCode":"3173","phone":"037-648-5650","latitude":-37.7742129,"longitude":176.1140377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-18 17:48:40","updateDate":"2018-07-18 17:50:15","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"apN49C","name":"American Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"American Brown Ale","description":"A blend of flavors from crystal, brown, & chocolate malts.

A better product that not only tastes great, but is also made in a responsible and sustainable way. We use 100% organic 2-Row in all of our beers and each of our beers is comprised of at least 90% organic ingredients. No genetic modification, no pesticides, no BS just great beer.\r\n\r\nREUSE, RECYCLE & REDUCE\r\n\r\nElbow grease is an understatement to how we built our brewery. We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?\r\n\r\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER?\r\n\r\nWe want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you. So the next time you have a pint of Heritage be sure to stop and think about all that is going into the beer in front of you.\r\n\r\nCome check out our taproom when your in northern Virginia or grab one of our beers on tap or in stores.","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:34:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:12:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"B5K20TQZ47","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"UNp9ot","name":"Heritage Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"9436 Center Point Lane","locality":"Manassas","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20110","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","latitude":38.752225,"longitude":-77.4895437,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:35:22","updateDate":"2015-10-13 19:23:55","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NJl5V3","name":"American Expedition Honey Ginger Wheat Ale Shandy","nameDisplay":"American Expedition Honey Ginger Wheat Ale Shandy","abv":"3.5","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-07-18 06:41:36","updateDate":"2017-07-18 14:19:05","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

We\u2019re true to the craft because we honor traditions of workmanship perfected by centuries of well-trained hands.\r\n\r\nThe Fidelis Philosophy took root in the fertile soil of Shawnee-On-Delaware, Pennsylvania. Our village, bounded by wooded hills on one side and the Delaware River on the other, enjoys a mild and varied climate, plenty of water and sun, abundant plants and wildlife and friendly, talented people. We are captivated by this nature and its possibilities. And our location- less than 100 miles from both New York City and Philadelphia- makes it only natural for us to broadly share the Fidelis Philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn a world of mass-production, our products are handmade. In a world of homogeneity, our products represent a defiant individuality. In a world without roots, our products embody a tangible sense of place. We aspire to eat what we grow, to drink what we brew, and to build what we use. And we\u2019d like you to experience a taste of this lifestyle yourself- in the form of ShawneeCraft beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.shawneecraftbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vSGcZr\/upload_bHMyOR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vSGcZr\/upload_bHMyOR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vSGcZr\/upload_bHMyOR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vSGcZr\/upload_bHMyOR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vSGcZr\/upload_bHMyOR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:42:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JQIUEMHK03","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"haX4c9","name":"Gem & Keystone","streetAddress":"1 River Road","locality":"Shawnee On Delaware","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18356","phone":"(570) 424-0990","website":"http:\/\/www.shawneecraftbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm","latitude":41.008177,"longitude":-75.108645,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"0nbvfO","name":"ShawneeCraft Brewery","streetAddress":"1 River Road","locality":"Shawnee On Delaware","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18356","phone":"(570) 213-5151","website":"http:\/\/www.shawneecraftbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room Hours:\r\nWednesday - Sunday: 12:00 - 5:00 and Thursdays until 10:00\r\n\r\nTours:\r\nWednesday - Sunday: 12:00","latitude":41.008177,"longitude":-75.108645,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-13 17:01:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tasting Room Hours:\r\nWednesday - Sunday: 12:00 - 5:00 and Thursdays until 10:00\r\n\r\nTours:\r\nWednesday - Sunday: 12:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"z4QfMz","name":"American Flyer","nameDisplay":"American Flyer","description":"Proud to be a micro-beer brewed the \u201ceasy way\u201d, with no adjuncts, no beechwood, and no tortuous filtration.

After brewing nearly 1,000 gallons of beer in his basement, our owner Steve Albers, decided to take the leap of faith and open Center Ice Brewery with a goal to bring hockey fans, parents, players, coaches and those in the craft beer community together. As an avid hockey player himself, he utilized his ties to the sport to build a brewery that celebrated the heritage of both hockey and St. Louis.\r\n\r\nWith copious amounts of wood salvaged from the demolition site of the \u201cOld Barn,\u201d Center Ice Brewery offers guests a piece of hockey history, boasting artifacts and memorabilia on the walls, along with the bar top and tables being built out of the arena wood itself. You can even take a photo inside of the old penalty box. \r\n\r\nAs for the beer, we pride ourselves on continuously expanding and innovating our portfolio.

The Micro Brewing Company and Restaurant is known as a neighborhood icon in Fresno. Scott and Michele changed the name to wholesale their beer throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nKevin continued on as Sequoia's Brewmaster, putting together a creative mix of 11 unique ales and lagers on tap brewed with the finest ingredients including monthly special beers, wines, specialty drinks, and their homemade Root Beer. Recently, Rick Bouke took over as Brewmaster, and is responsible for the high quality and craft beer character our customers have come to expect. Sequoia's menu offers great food with the freshest ingredients, serves Certified Angus Beef, prepares their sauces and items from scratch and offers fresh daily fish.\r\n\r\nSequoia offers a menu for all ages in a warm and comfortable atmosphere, where everyone knows your name. Sequoia is a hot spot for live music featuring the best local bands and a private party room. A second location with a mountain lodge atmosphere, rock fireplace and a patio was opened in Northeast Fresno in July of 2005 at Piazza del Fiore. Along with the same great beers on tap, there is a full bar at the Champlain location.","website":"http:\/\/www.sequoiabrewing.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/l8xFof\/upload_fSk6Ws-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2019-10-21 19:07:47","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ETI0V8UH23","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WPIz5n","name":"Tower District","streetAddress":"777 East Olive Avenue","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","postalCode":"93728","phone":"559-264-5521","website":"http:\/\/www.sequoiabrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Wed 11am - 10pm\r\nThur 11am - 11pm\r\nFri - Sat 11am - Midnight\r\nSunday 10am - 10pm\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOUR\r\nMon - Fri 3pm - 6pm\r\nSat 1pm-4pm\r\nSun 10am - 12pm. 1pm - 4pm","latitude":36.758189,"longitude":-119.801674,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Wed 11am - 10pm\r\nThur 11am - 11pm\r\nFri - Sat 11am - Midnight\r\nSunday 10am - 10pm\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOUR\r\nMon - Fri 3pm - 6pm\r\nSat 1pm-4pm\r\nSun 10am - 12pm. 1pm - 4pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"HcnHXH","name":"North Fresno","streetAddress":"1188 E.
