For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

From share plates to weekly curry specials, there's always something for everyone including vegetarian and gluten-free options.\r\n \r\nWe truly appreciate the support you have all given us since opening and we look forward to seeing you here at Flat Rock Brew Cafe in the near future.","website":"http:\/\/www.flatrockbrewcafe.com.au\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-06 22:27:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"W8Mdcy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"290 Willoughby Road","region":"Sydney","postalCode":"2065","phone":"+61 2 9460 6696","website":"http:\/\/www.flatrockbrewcafe.com.au","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Fri: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":-33.817406,"longitude":151.200852,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-08 15:55:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed - Fri: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"A5tv2Y","name":"English Bitter","nameDisplay":"English Bitter","abv":"4.3","styleId":3,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-11 18:38:21","updateDate":"2015-03-11 18:38:21","style":{"id":3,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Ordinary Bitter","shortName":"Bitter","description":"Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:22:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5NJLHA2D94","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4sf7hF","name":"English Brown","nameDisplay":"English Brown","description":"An english brown ale with flavors of toasted and caramel malts, finishing with lots of UK fuggles hops.","abv":"5.4","styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-08 19:42:19","updateDate":"2015-04-08 19:42:19","style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

Each of our craft beers will be highlighted and served in it's own special glass that will enhance the look, feel and flavor of the brewed product.","website":"http:\/\/www.headstrongbrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-18 17:50:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:15:25","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VEOSRHC74Q","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"gLx8is","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"126 N 3rd St","locality":"Douglas","region":"Wyoming","postalCode":"82633","phone":"(307)359-8801","latitude":42.760612,"longitude":-105.384466,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-18 17:53:48","updateDate":"2014-09-18 17:53:48","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NhswZu","name":"English Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"English Brown Ale","abv":"5","availableId":1,"styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-22 15:16:47","updateDate":"2015-05-26 18:56:22","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.
