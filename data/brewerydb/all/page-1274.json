Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:27:08"}},{"id":"V5gw8N","name":"Pumpkin Beast","nameDisplay":"Pumpkin Beast","abv":"6.2","ibu":"17","glasswareId":5,"srmId":14,"availableId":7,"styleId":121,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/V5gw8N\/upload_DjjEaH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/V5gw8N\/upload_DjjEaH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/V5gw8N\/upload_DjjEaH-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/V5gw8N\/upload_DjjEaH-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/V5gw8N\/upload_DjjEaH-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/V5gw8N\/upload_DjjEaH-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-15 19:43:40","updateDate":"2015-12-17 06:19:00","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":14,"name":"14","hex":"C35900"},"available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."},"style":{"id":121,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pumpkin Beer","shortName":"Pumpkin Beer","description":"Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.
