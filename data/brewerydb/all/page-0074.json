Ltd (New Zealand)","nameShortDisplay":"Fitzpatrick's (New Zealand)","description":"About The BreweryAbout The Brewery\r\nFitzpatrick\u2019s Brewing Co Limited is a small (5ha) family owned Brewery which became licensed in September 2012.\r\n\r\nAs per the namesake, the brewery is owned and operated by Craig Fitzpatrick (aka Fitzy) and wife Catherine. Their primary goal is to serve the immediate local market with fresh flavoursome beer.\r\n\r\nThe brewery has been a long time in the making, stemming from a long passion for beer and many years of home brewing. Fitzy started out brewing his first beer back in 1987 as a 16 year old. It was a Muntons \u2013 English Mild that seeded the journey many moons ago\u2026 in an era where good ingredients and quality information were very hard to obtain \u2013 oh how different it is today.\r\n\r\nHaving become lost in the wilderness for several years, the passion for great beer and brewing was rekindled when working with some like minded individuals circa 2001 at Unisys in Wellington. They would knock off at 4.30pm and have regular Friday afternoon beer tasting sessions, blind critiquing whatever was brought in, including their own special brews. Needless to say there was a great deal of heated discussion regarding the qualities or faults of each particular beer.\r\n\r\nThe passion for great tasting beer grew to such an extent that when the Fitzpatrick family moved to Tauranga in 2003, a \u201cbrewery space\u201d was added to the new shed plans, for that \u2018one day dream\u2019.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.brevard-brewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:03:43","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:29:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"70PTLNDRBF","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ktgW91","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"63 East Main Street","locality":"Brevard","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28712","hoursOfOperation":"Monday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm","latitude":35.2333243,"longitude":-82.7333116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:04:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:32","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-4:00pm-10:00pm,tue-4:00pm-10:00pm,wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-2:00pm-12:00am,sat-2:00pm-12:00am,sun-2:00pm-9:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Sbp244","name":"American IPA - Farm House Ales Series","nameDisplay":"American IPA - Farm House Ales Series","description":"Available for the first time in a standalone package, our Farmhouse American IPA is a bold, American IPA featuring Falconer's Flight hops - a blend of the Pacific Northwest's most unique hop varieties - and loaded with floral, citrus and grapefruit notes.","abv":"6.4","ibu":"70","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Sbp244\/upload_730hvi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Sbp244\/upload_730hvi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Sbp244\/upload_730hvi-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Sbp244\/upload_730hvi-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Sbp244\/upload_730hvi-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Sbp244\/upload_730hvi-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-06 13:13:20","updateDate":"2015-12-17 14:10:49","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

After nearly nine years of refining my favorite recipe for American Pale Ale, I\u2019m thrilled to have it be the flagship for Medford Brewing Company.","website":"http:\/\/medfordbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cadrve\/upload_1Y4Pvt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cadrve\/upload_1Y4Pvt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cadrve\/upload_1Y4Pvt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cadrve\/upload_1Y4Pvt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/cadrve\/upload_1Y4Pvt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-16 18:24:31","updateDate":"2019-08-06 14:35:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TQPovU","name":"Medford Brewing Company","locality":"Medford","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02155","website":"medfordbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":42.4274971,"longitude":-71.1092012,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-16 19:29:42","updateDate":"2018-08-16 19:54:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"5k8d4v","name":"Medford Brewing Company","locality":"Medford","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04463","latitude":45.2853307,"longitude":-68.8517011,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-16 19:54:08","updateDate":"2018-08-16 19:54:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Yq042x","name":"American Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"American Pale Ale","abv":"5.6","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-24 19:46:30","updateDate":"2015-11-24 19:46:30","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"TnYooJ","name":"Dewey Beer Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Dewey Beer Co.","website":"http:\/\/www.deweybeerco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-18 20:25:37","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:28:58","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"VQIKTBGM72","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"cL8six","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2100 Costal Highway","locality":"Dewey Beach","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19971","website":"http:\/\/Deweybeerco.com","latitude":38.6960674,"longitude":-75.0750914,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-18 20:25:38","updateDate":"2017-08-22 16:16:29","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
