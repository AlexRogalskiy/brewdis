If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

The premier leadership sponsorship deal included offering our beer at all official ArtPrize events, signage, promotion, merchandise, specialized glassware and other items. It also included permission for us to use the ArtPrize identity marks (logo and graphics) on any co-packaged items, including beer. We plan to release a new beer for each year of our five-year partnership with ArtPrize under the name \u201cArtist Series\u201d. This is year two. Last year\u2019s release was Inspired Artist Black IPA.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaking a unique beer in honor of ArtPrize has become a fun challenge for our brewers,\u201d said Dave Engbers, our co-founder and vice president of brand and education. \u201cThis year\u2019s release just fell into place. Ninkasi\u2014a stained glass ArtPrize submission that showed in our taproom last year\u2014became a permanent part of our taproom when we purchased it last year. We knew right away that it would make a perfect label for Mosaic Promise, a beautifully simple beer that we had been experimenting with for some time.\u201d\r\n\r\nMosaic Promise showcases a single malt\u2014Golden Promise\u2014and a single hop\u2014Mosaic. The traditional barley\u2019s depth of flavor and the versatility of the hops\u2019 bittering, flavor and aroma characteristics are the strong pillars that comprise the structure of this clean, rich, golden beer. We can brew complex beers with the best of them, but we recognize that there\u2019s also beauty in simplicity. The beer clocks in at 5.5% ABV and 50 IBUs.\r\n\r\nProceeds from the sale of Mosaic Promise will support the future programming of the ArtPrize organization. ArtPrize is an international art competition, open to any artist and decided by public vote. Its mission is to promote critical dialogue and collaboration through new, creative ideas among a large and diverse population of people. As an innovator in redefining what beer can be, we believe that experimentation is central to the human experience\u2014whether one experiments with grains and hops or colored glass and light\u2014and that sharing one\u2019s creation with the public is a brave act worth celebrating.\r\n\r\n\u201cFounders is an iconic brand producing a sublime range of exquisite beers in our own Grand Rapids,\u201d said Christian Gaines, executive director of ArtPrize. \u201cWe\u2019re honored and elated to count Founders as the ArtPrize Official Brewery and to include Mosaic Promise as the latest special release beer\u2014one that\u2019s emblematic of our strong partnership and shared commitment to art, artists and community.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore than 400,000 people are expected to attend ArtPrize 2014.\r\n\r\nWe also partnered with ArtPrize to launch ArtPrize on Tap, the newest ArtClub membership perk. From the patios of the Centennial Room, our private second-floor entertainment space, ArtPrize on Tap offers ArtClub members the opportunity to connect year-round and stay on the ArtPrize insider track, while enjoying Founders food and beer. We will premiere Mosaic Promise at the August installment of ArtPrize on Tap. Held on the third Wednesday of every month, ArtPrize on Tap is free for ArtClub members, and friends of ArtPrize and Founders can join for $10. To learn more, go to artprize.org\/artclub.\r\n\r\nMosaic Promise will be available for a limited time starting on Sunday, September 14, across our Michigan, Wisconsin, metro NYC and Chicagoland distribution footprint. It will be released in our taproom on draft and in bottles starting on Tuesday, September 16. There will be an event in our taproom featuring the artists and introducing the beer from 4:30-6:30pm that day. One-of-a-kind Mosaic Promise posters will be given away, while supplies last. Mosaic Promise will also be featured at official ArtPrize events.\r\n\r\nThis year marks the sixth edition of ArtPrize, which will take place Sept. 24\u2013Oct. 12, 2014. Our taproom will be a venue for the sixth year running.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"50","srmId":9,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5DuGFq\/upload_FC5y33-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-19 01:48:00","updateDate":"2016-04-14 17:16:19","srm":{"id":9,"name":"9","hex":"E58500"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
