The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Even a hibiscus flower is there to accent this beauty. \r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nIPA \u2013 India Pale Ale  \r\n\r\n7.2% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 62 IBU \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere is a common mindset that an IPA has to be very bitter. We don\u2019t agree.  We chose to keep our IPA\u2019s bitterness restrained while packing it full of hop aroma and flavor, thanks to healthy doses of Columbus, Centennial and Chinook hops added after fermentation. It\u2019s pungency of tropical fruit, citrus and earthy spice are displayed over a special blend of domestic and European malts that lend a unique richness to the beer. Enjoy! \r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nDouble Goat \u2013 Double IPA\r\n\r\n8.2% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 82 IBU\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with loud music, you might not always be in the mood for a Double IPA. But once you get into a good one, it's hard not to find joy in such a hoppy thrill! For our DIPA we dared to seek the implausible: BALANCE, nuanced flavors, and restrained bitterness that defy its massive hopping and higher ABV. We hope you enjoy its nose of honeydew melon and the Herb, followed by lavish flavors of pine, lemon and grapefruit peel, and juicy oranges. Then pair it with bacon-topped anything and heavy metal hair whipping with two goats held high!\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAltbier \u2013 Northern German Amber Beer\r\n\r\n6.3% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 45 IBU\r\n\r\n\r\nAn often unfamiliar and certainly under-appreciated style in the U.S., Altbier is a traditional German amber ale made famous by the regions surrounding D\u00fcsseldorf. An Alt should be nearly brown in color and possess a full-bodied, European malt character that is layered with distinct caramel sweetness and a mild breadiness. Altbiers should finish dry, with a firm noble hop bitterness. We make Amador Brewing Company\u2019s Altbier in just this way, to make the style shine. An amazingly food-friendly beer, give our Alt to your favorite Chef and incredible pairings will follow.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nKolsch \u2013 Kolsch-Style Ale  \r\n\r\n5.2% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 28 IBU\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA Kolsch-Style Ale is essentially a Pilsner that is fermented with an Ale Yeast instead of a Lager Yeast. Fermenting with an Ale Yeast brings subtle tropical aromas and a touch of meyer lemon, which mesh beautifully with herbal tones and spice that come from the Sterling hop. What a Kolsch maintains from a Pilsner are its light, distinctive European malt character and a perfectly crisp finish. A thirst quencher for sure, you can\u2019t go wrong with this beautifully-made Kolsch any time of year!\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\"Kit Carson Pale Ale\" - American Pale Ale\r\n\r\n5.5% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 40 IBU\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCan a beer beckon for adventure? Kit Carson does, with a beautiful coppery color, enticing tropical aromas paralleled by fresh pine, and the white wildflowers of the Sierra. Refreshing, with medium body and a hint of bitterness on the finish, this well-balanced pale ale is perfect for summertime and daydreaming of the good life--whether that's lounging in the tropics, or kayaking remote mountain streams.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nDeep Hop Red \u2013 Red Ale  \r\n\r\n6.6% ALC. by VOL. \u2013 66 IBU \r\n\r\n\r\nA hearty, West-Coast Red by style, but with a focus on kettle hops as opposed to dry hops. Copious late kettle hop additions and a blend of six domestic and European malts create complex flavors at both ends. This beer goes deep and showcases flavors of stone fruit and baker\u2019s bitter chocolate. A can\u2019t lose brew for your backyard BBQ or party.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\"Night Hike Porter\" - Porter\r\n\r\n7.3% ABV \u2013 46 IBU \r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nNight Hike Porter resides proudly between the American Robust Porter and lesser-known Baltic styles. Baltic porters traditionally show influence from Russian Imperial Stout (RIS), and in this context, our porter exhibits dark fruit and roast characters that would be appropriate in RIS, without its often burnt overtones or heaviness.  With a nod to the Baltic style, hints of citrus and mint hop character, and a deceptively drinkable finish, our porter has accompanied many a moonlit country walk. A favorite of the staff and our close friends for years.","abv":"7.3","ibu":"46","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-22 17:56:56","updateDate":"2018-10-22 17:56:56","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
