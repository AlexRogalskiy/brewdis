This beer carries HEAT. We used fresh habanero peppers and cracked black pepper to create a beer that is both sweet and hot. First there is spice (like candied ginger) followed by a cool malty sweetness. THEN. . . the intense flavor and heat from the habanero and black pepper. Your journey ends with a lingering tickle at the base of your throat. And you are left with a question \u2013 Did this really happen? I need another to be sure.","abv":"6.8","availableId":4,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-23 12:54:34","updateDate":"2014-12-10 18:17:30","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
