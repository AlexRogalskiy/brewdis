The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

We have a DIY ethic when it comes to our beer, our brewery and our business - in other words, we prefer to do things our own way (often, the hard way).  All of our beers' recipes were designed and perfected by us, and even our 5-barrel brewing system was custom built by the Jackrabbit crew.  If you come across our beer on tap, or in bottles at your local retailer, rest assured that we poured our passion for beer into every ounce.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackrabbitbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 16:14:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:49:21","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7YAUXLODRQ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"tdu8Qi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1323 Terminal St.","locality":"West Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95691","latitude":38.5718525,"longitude":-121.5413488,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","updateDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-5:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AO25Xq","name":"Big Red","nameDisplay":"Big Red","description":"It\u2019s big, red and full of character.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.
