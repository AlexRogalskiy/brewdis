The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:29:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"R1KWA8UYM3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nCojAV","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"410 James Street","locality":"Ludington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49431","phone":"231-845-2522","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":43.9523739,"longitude":-86.4478298,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"39nFgL","name":"Smolder","nameDisplay":"Smolder","description":"Smokey, chocolatey, and slightly spicy porter aged with dried chipotle peppers and cacao nibs.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

Randy would bring home fresh apple cider and over the years would make hard cider from this for family and friends. Josh became intrigued with the process and started to learn some Raboin family tradition of making hard cider. As the years passed every fall and winter Josh would obtain fresh apple cider from the farm, start the process of fermenting it, and turning it hard for family and friends. Josh began experimenting more and more throughout the years with different recipes and ingredients developing unique hard ciders.\r\n\r\nTalks between Josh and Joe about bringing these hard ciders to the public began in 2012. Fast forward to today and Redhead Ciderhouse is now producing and distributing these hard ciders throughout Northern Ohio.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"suTHjQ","name":"Smooth Operator","nameDisplay":"Smooth Operator","description":"Mango and vanilla milkshake IPA.","abv":"6.5","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-18 14:25:10","updateDate":"2018-09-18 14:25:10","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

If ever a brewery was born to endorse the world\u2019s first kilt-required surfing competition, McLeod\u2019s Brewery is it. Of course, it hasn\u2019t been all rainbows and longboards. It took us a while to get here.\r\n\r\nWe spent childhood summers burning our feet on the sand and riding waves in Waipu Cove. This slice of delicious Pacific paradise was home-away-from-home when we were wee ones, so when it came time to kick corporate life to the kerb, we knew where to go.\r\n\r\nWaipu\u2019s Pizza Barn was already a \u2018thing\u2019 when we bought it in 2003, but we quickly put our fingerprint on it (i.e. draped in more tartan than a McLeod within earshot of Dunvegan). We then hired half the village and worked right alongside them in the kitchen and at the bar - and still do! We even created a menu we loved. All was grand \u2026except the beer.\r\n\r\nBig fans of craft beer from travels abroad, we craved brews bold in flavour and wholly authentic. We also wanted to make it right out back. So we did.\r\n\r\nTapping into local immigrant Scottish heritage, we found a name (Brothers Gwynne Brewing didn't have quite the same \u2018ring\u2019). After launching in 2014 \u2013 with a few \u2018starts\u2019 and \u2018stops\u2019 - here we are and there you are reading this. You know what they say about overnight success, though? It takes ten years and then some. But it's all good, and we're enjoying the ride..\r\n\r\nWe now have a great \u2018brew crew\u2019 which includes Head Brewer Jason Bathgate who\u2019s worked for no less than two champion New Zealand breweries. At his side and with us since Day One is Assistant Brewer Milton Mewett. All of us work hard and love what we do. Not much more exciting than that, really. Truth be told, we\u2019re pretty keen to get that surf compo organized. Like our beers, it could be great fun and nothing short of pure dead brilliant.\r\n\r\nSlainte!\r\n\r\nGeoff & Clayton Gwynne","website":"http:\/\/www.mcleodsbrewery.co.nz","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-09 01:10:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mptyoj","name":"McLeod's","streetAddress":"2 Cove Road","locality":"Waipu","region":"Northland","postalCode":"0510","phone":"64) 21361118","website":"http:\/\/www.mcleodsbrewery.co.nz","latitude":-35.9850852,"longitude":174.4477751,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-09 17:34:46","updateDate":"2018-08-09 17:36:37","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"exKGNv","name":"Smugglers Hazelnut Stout","nameDisplay":"Smugglers Hazelnut Stout","abv":"5.5","styleId":20,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-04 19:52:41","updateDate":"2014-10-09 15:59:35","style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"v0MKXA","name":"Smuttynose Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Smuttynose","description":"Smuttynose was founded in 1994 by the folks who started the Northampton and Portsmouth Breweries.
