The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"beerVariation":{"id":"uwXKC6","name":"Tr\u00f6egs Splinter Beer Gold","nameDisplay":"Tr\u00f6egs Splinter Beer Gold","abv":"12","styleId":59,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:25","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:08","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"uHVh1e","name":"Black Raven Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Black Raven","description":"The Black Raven is a true neighborhood brewery with a retail taproom.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers.

It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QbZbCr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1221 East Pike Street","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98122","phone":"206-860-3977","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","latitude":47.614033,"longitude":-122.315716,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"7S4DH1","name":"TangleTown","streetAddress":"2106 N 55th St, Seattle, WA 98103","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"206-547-5929","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM","latitude":47.668918,"longitude":-122.333473,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1SmfcR","name":"Split The Night","nameDisplay":"Split The Night","description":"Coffee porter","abv":"6.4","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-21 18:58:06","updateDate":"2018-01-30 19:53:29","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
