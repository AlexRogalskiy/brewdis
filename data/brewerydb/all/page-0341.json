These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"VDMEV7","name":"Boulevard Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Boulevard","description":"Welcome to Boulevard Brewing Company, the Midwest's home for fine ales and lagers since 1989.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"OR1ggJ","name":"Beaus All Natural Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Beaus All Natural","description":"Beaus is located inside an old tannery in an industrial park, and makes some of the best craft brews in Canada, showing ingenuity in their craft, but also in marketing and distribution.

Our success is derived from hard work, unbridled passion and the support from customers who appreciate these qualities and a well made beer.\r\n\r\nWhile we take great care in making the best beer possible, we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We go out of our way to take any pretense out of our beer. We believe in rustic, natural quality over fancy-pants snobbery. Our marketing and branding efforts try to reinforce this and we choose to market by talking to folks instead of blaring messages through mass-market advertising.","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"Y","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:33:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lvNMRa","name":"Beaus Brewery","streetAddress":"10 Terry Fox Drive","locality":"Vankleek Hill","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"K0B 1R0","phone":"(866) 585 BEER","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","hoursOfOperation":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","latitude":45.5177348,"longitude":-74.6374259,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:36:23","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hu2kJj","name":"Channel Marker IPA","nameDisplay":"Channel Marker IPA","description":"This IPA does not need a compass to point you in the right direction to return to the islands.

Chaos ensues from the countless strains of yeast and bacteria fighting for dominance, and after 9 - 14 months in the barrel, we introduce the power of blending to bring order back, ultimately creating a beer that's greater than the sum of its parts.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"XNebo0","name":"Orpheus Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Orpheus","description":"Orpheus Brewing is an artisanal brewery overlooking Piedmont Park and the Beltline.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
