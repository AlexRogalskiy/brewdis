It was a modest beginning with some obstacles, but enthusiasm prevailed and thanks to the support of our loyal customers, it was a success! Our original location is also a busy restaurant and local watering hole, featuring a full menu and 9 rotating Second Street beers on tap. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, we opened our second location next to the Santa Fe Farmer\u2019s Market in the Railyard District. The Railyard area is a busy arts and entertainment district, where you can find a different show, market or exhibit every day of the week. Our Railyard taproom has a full menu, patio and a rotating selection of beers on draft. \r\n\r\nThe Rufina Taproom, established in 2017,  is our third location in Santa Fe and it marks a major expansion for our company. Located in a unique and rapidly evolving area formerly considered Santa Fe\u2019s \u201cHeavy industrial\u201d zone where you can still have your car repaired and recycle your scrap metal, it is also a thriving art district with theatres, music venues and Meow Wolf\u2019s ever evolving art installation.\r\n\r\n2920 Rufina also houses our new 20bbl\/three vessel production brewery and packaging facility. Our goal in this taproom is to bring together the spirit of Second Street and our new neighborhood; An ever changing rotation of our unique beers, featured beer from other New Mexico breweries, unique food, friendly service, and curated live music featuring local and national artists.  \r\n\r\nIn 2018 we started packaging and distributing Second Street beer statewide. You can now enjoy Santa Fe\u2019s favorite beer on draft in restaurants and bars, and purchase it in cans to bring home and to your next gathering. We look forward to expanding our can options to include seasonal and special edition brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WVVdVn\/upload_Hqv94r-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2019-06-12 17:42:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HYMUDNW6KP","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"HlrMmv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1814 Second Street","locality":"Santa Fe","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87505","phone":"1-505-982-3030","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","latitude":35.6633395,"longitude":-105.9659469,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9eVz7n","name":"Railyard","streetAddress":"1607 Paseo De Peralta","extendedAddress":"#10","locality":"Santa Fe","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87501","phone":"(505) 989-3278","website":"http:\/\/www.secondstreetbrewery.com\/","latitude":35.6821338,"longitude":-105.9490908,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-10-30 11:44:38","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"S9SExH","name":"Simcoe Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Simcoe Pale Ale","description":"An American Pale Ale bittered, flavored, and dry hopped exclusively with Simcoe hops.","abv":"5.2","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-21 22:23:31","updateDate":"2012-04-21 22:23:31","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"duEdCS","name":"Fair State Brewing Cooperative","nameShortDisplay":"Fair State Brewing Cooperative","description":"Fair State Brewing Cooperative is Minnesota's first and only cooperatively-owned brewery, where you can truly drink like you own the place.

We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
