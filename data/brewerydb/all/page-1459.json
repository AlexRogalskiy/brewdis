There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"stNt81","name":"Second Chance Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Second Chance","description":"Second Chance is our ultimate expression of opportunity - we may not all get one, but when we do, seize it!

Lift Off IPA quickly grew to become one of the best selling craft beers across Indianapolis and Indiana. Due to market demand we reached capacity at our original production-only brewery on the southeast side of Indianapolis in mid-2013. To expand we purchased a 2.0-acre site in the Speedway neighborhood of Indianapolis in February 2014.\r\n \r\nWe relocated all of our operations to the new location in May 2015. While we are most known for our flagship Lift Off IPA since relocating to the new brewery we also now distribute year round on draft and in cans our Vacation K\u00f6lsch, Muse Belgian Golden Ale, and Rip Cord Double IPA and we have a quarterly special release program with a focus on traditional German-style lagers, American IPAs and flavorful ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.daredevilbeer.com\/","established":"2012","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/daredevilbeer.us6.list-manage2.com\/subscribe\/post?u=f4573ffc5ec7c2f3411dd02df&id=57df9f998b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WfHl3C\/upload_hNFIIU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-24 16:17:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:51:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5E71K03ZL4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"ENh5sW","name":"Daredevil Brewing Co","streetAddress":"1151 N Main Street","locality":"Speedway","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46224","website":"http:\/\/www.daredevilbeer.com\/","latitude":39.7823784,"longitude":-86.2405797,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-24 16:18:06","updateDate":"2019-07-11 19:08:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Yxge6J","name":"Daredevil Hall","streetAddress":"2721 E 86th Street, Suite 180","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46240","phone":"317.757.2888","website":"www.daredevilbeer.com\/thehall","latitude":39.9119906,"longitude":-86.1177247,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2019","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-11 19:03:45","updateDate":"2019-07-11 19:29:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HLGisg","name":"Slip-ons","nameDisplay":"Slip-ons","abv":"6.5","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-13 13:09:33","updateDate":"2018-07-13 13:09:33","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and California.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Salted Caramel Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They also brew many seasonals throughout the year: Slippery Slope, Drop the M.I.C., Paulina Lake Pilsner, Rooster Tail Ale, Riverside Red, Silverback Stout, Cherry Blonde, Angus MacDouglas Amber, just to name a few.

A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.  We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility\u2013the only one of its kind in Canada.  The same renegade passion and creativity that drove a young brewer to start a brewery on credit cards continues to be the driving force everything that we do today.","website":"http:\/\/www.phillipsbeer.com","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Dl36n0\/upload_oPEa09-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 07:07:30","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vTSRcK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2010 Government St.","locality":"Victoria","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V8T 4P1","phone":"250 380-1912","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","latitude":48.4326736,"longitude":-123.3673092,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-18 15:06:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon: 9am - 5pm\r\nTues-Thurs: 10am - 6pm\r\nFri: 10am - 7pm\r\nSat: 11am - 6pm","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yWzBop","name":"Slizzard","nameDisplay":"Slizzard","abv":"6.4","styleId":172,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-17 14:14:20","updateDate":"2019-06-17 14:14:20","style":{"id":172,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Juicy or Hazy India Pale Ale","shortName":"Juicy or Hazy IPA","description":"Color: Straw to deep gold\r\n\r\nClarity: Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers.

However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.","website":"http:\/\/www.nwpeaksbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"PG4ybp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4912 17th Avenue Northwest","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"206-853-0525","latitude":47.664834,"longitude":-122.378656,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"n6Jy9c","name":"Sloatman Special","nameDisplay":"Sloatman Special","description":"A refreshing golden ale with a touch of coriander and lemongrass","abv":"4.8","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-08 21:14:22","updateDate":"2015-04-08 21:14:22","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
