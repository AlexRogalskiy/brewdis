Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"yUTidu","name":"Dry Ground Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Dry Ground","description":"Dry Ground Brewing Company is Paducah's first craft brewery.

Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Money is nice; happiness in life is priceless. The reward of your daily \u201cwork\u201d is a treasure most never know or understand. Previous work experience has shown us that money isn\u2019t everything, hating your work life and dragging that home is a terrible thing for a family. We feel that inherent happiness in work will result in financial success. Organically allowing passion and interest to drive your business is a viable model in our opinion.\r\nThe intangibles are always a concern. We try to alleviate that by paying due concern to all things unknown or uncomfortable to us, being wise and humble enough to seek help when we need it. It may be a bit nostalgic but we celebrate the smallness and the blending of science and art. We believe that having a \u201cneighborhood brewery\u201d where people come to enjoy good beer, camaraderie and see what is available on any given day is a very viable concept. Our approach builds in flexibility with the product and marketing plan. It will allow us to build the best beers we can and stay focused on that. We will have flexibility to experiment and have a chance to be directly interactive with and interested in our customer base.","website":"https:\/\/www.dogberrybrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wnVhxE\/upload_D50848-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-20 20:25:55","updateDate":"2018-12-10 20:47:09","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MIWEU8P9LD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"WMC12U","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9964 Crescent Park Dr","locality":"West Chester Township","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45069","phone":"(513) 847-8208","latitude":39.3042567,"longitude":-84.4196302,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-09-06 15:31:36","updateDate":"2017-09-06 15:31:36","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NWfSmN","name":"Undressed","nameDisplay":"Undressed","abv":"6.9","styleId":57,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-02 15:23:10","updateDate":"2015-08-02 15:23:10","style":{"id":57,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Flanders Oud Bruin or Oud Red Ales","shortName":"Flanders Red","description":"This light- to medium-bodied deep copper to brown ale is characterized by a slight to strong lactic sourness, and with \"Reds\" sometimes a balanced degree of acetic acid.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

They may or may not be clear. Exhibiting a small amount of yeast haze in the appearance is acceptable. Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur compounds in aroma and flavor should be apparent, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. There should be no diacetyl detectable. Dry hopping is acceptable. Head retention may not be optimal. Contemporary Version of Kellerbier: Beers that are packaged or on draft which are unfiltered versions of other lager styles. These may share many attributes of traditional versions, but are generally fully carbonated, fully lagered, with full head retention and absent of acetaldehyde.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:39:16"},"breweries":[{"id":"Mi9ofP","name":"Camden Town Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Camden Town","description":"Welcome to Camden Town Brewery.
