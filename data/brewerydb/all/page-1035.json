These unflavored blended and secondary fermented lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and are characterized by intense fruity-estery, sour, and acidic aromas and flavors. These pale beers are brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Diacetyl should be absent.

These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional gueuze lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.8","abvMax":"8.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:40"}},{"id":"lSzHeB","name":"Millennium Lager","nameDisplay":"Millennium Lager","description":"A classic pilsner.","abv":"5","glasswareId":5,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lSzHeB\/upload_wb2fsH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lSzHeB\/upload_wb2fsH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lSzHeB\/upload_wb2fsH-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lSzHeB\/upload_wb2fsH-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lSzHeB\/upload_wb2fsH-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/lSzHeB\/upload_wb2fsH-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:42","updateDate":"2015-12-16 04:57:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.
