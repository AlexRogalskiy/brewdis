Malted barley, wheat and rye may be used as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats and corn. A mild malt character could be evident. Aroma\/Flavor hops are most commonly used to employ a flavor balance that is only low in bitterness. Traditional versions do not use artificial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions of this beer incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to a perception of smoothness. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in barely perceptible amounts, but this is not common. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall.

After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.\r\n \r\nWe host 3 annual events, The Virginia Herb Festival (June), BRB Hop Harvest Party (August) and BRB Holiday Market (November). \r\n \r\nYou are cordially invited to come and drink our beer, eat, play and spend some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.backroombreweryva.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:40:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EZKWH4V13N","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"CEon99","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Ridgemont Rd.","locality":"Middletown","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22645","phone":"540-869-8482","latitude":38.9956004,"longitude":-78.2210269,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:28:31","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PhRcpy","name":"Bay Of Bengal","nameDisplay":"Bay Of Bengal","abv":"8.9","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PhRcpy\/upload_cOqjVB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PhRcpy\/upload_cOqjVB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PhRcpy\/upload_cOqjVB-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PhRcpy\/upload_cOqjVB-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PhRcpy\/upload_cOqjVB-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/PhRcpy\/upload_cOqjVB-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-20 13:31:12","updateDate":"2015-12-18 06:04:45","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:10:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PI7THDWZB4","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qo6LCf","name":"Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom","streetAddress":"1621 Moore St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-827-6025","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","latitude":39.1137948,"longitude":-84.5150108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1853","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:45:48","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-10:00pm,thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-12:00am,sat-12:00pm-12:00am,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"X0HMO8","name":"Christian Moerlein Lager House","streetAddress":"115 Joe Nuxhall Way","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-421-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.moerleinlagerhouse.com\/","latitude":39.0963619,"longitude":-84.5087017,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:10:31","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:46:10","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"},{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-1:00pm-8:00pm,mon-11:00am-11:00pm,tue-1:00pm-8:00pm,tue-11:00am-11:00pm,wed-1:00pm-8:00pm,wed-11:00am-11:00pm,thu-1:00pm-8:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-11:00am,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ToeDPi","name":"Baybreeze","nameDisplay":"Baybreeze","abv":"5","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-12 22:38:17","updateDate":"2018-08-12 22:38:17","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

San Francisco Baykeeper, a local nonprofit, works nonstop to keep it that way. Only Baykeeper confronts polluters and stops harmful actions with their unique expertise in law, science, advocacy, and field investigations, helping achieve decades of legal and policy victories for a cleaner Bay.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate their accomplishments and 30th anniversary, we\u2019re introducing a collaboration beer that\u2019s as fierce as Baykeeper\u2019s commitment to preserving our Bay. Baykeeper IPA is a bright and delicious San Francisco-style IPA, overflowing with juicy and fruit-forward hop layers that finish crisp and dry.\r\n\r\nTeeming with lime, orange zest and papaya aromas, Baykeeper IPA has a slightly spicy, yet slightly sweet taste that finishes with a delicate bitterness. Mosaic, Cascade and Amarillo Cryo hops were used to amplify the fruity and piney hop aromatics in this slightly hazy brew. Anchor takes a balanced approach to the bitterness while ramping up the hop intensity in Baykeeper IPA, making it a tasty San Francisco-style IPA.\r\n\r\nBecause this brew is a celebration of the Bay, Anchor turned to its neighbor across the Bay for some of the malt used in Baykeeper IPA. Based in Alameda, Admiral Maltings makes small-batch, hand-crafted, organic malts produced using tried-and-true malting techniques. For Baykeeper IPA, Anchor used Admiral Gallagher\u2019s Best from the local maltster. In addition, Anchor used 2-Row Pale, Acidulated Malt, Golden Naked Oats, and Toasted Rice, combining to create an exceptional malt profile. The beer pours a deep golden color with a creamy, fluffy head.\r\n\r\nWatercolor artist Jenna Rainey hand-painted the label on Baykeeper IPA, which features Baykeeper\u2019s patrol boat charging through the water underneath the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. Since 1989, Baykeeper\u2019s patrol boat has regularly monitored the San Francisco Bay, the treasure of the Bay Area, to identify and investigate pollution. From there, Baykeeper strategically uses advocacy, public education and legal action to secure smart solutions that stops pollution and restores water quality so that native wildlife and recreational sport can continue to flourish.","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9jP6Ne\/upload_BAS4cr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9jP6Ne\/upload_BAS4cr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9jP6Ne\/upload_BAS4cr-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9jP6Ne\/upload_BAS4cr-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9jP6Ne\/upload_BAS4cr-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9jP6Ne\/upload_BAS4cr-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-29 13:59:05","updateDate":"2019-07-29 14:00:22","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.","website":"http:\/\/www.abita.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2018-11-09 19:06:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4IH367RVQ0","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"d8IJKF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"PO Box 1510","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"800-737-2311","latitude":30.4785257,"longitude":-90.0375755,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:14","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"PdSE1h","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21084 Louisiana 36","locality":"Covington","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70433","phone":"9858933143","latitude":30.482138,"longitude":-90.055185,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:34:50","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:30","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1xB2B8","name":"Brewpub","streetAddress":"72011 Holly Street","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"(985) 892-5837","website":"http:\/\/www.abitabrewpub.com\/","latitude":30.4787911,"longitude":-90.0392975,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:36:40","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:14:30","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PDel9f","name":"Bayou City Brown","nameDisplay":"Bayou City Brown","description":"A luscious, malt-oriented brown ale, with a caramel, dark fruit complexity of malt flavor.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
