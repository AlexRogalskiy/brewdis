Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops.

We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration.

The site was chosen by Grand Ridge for its exceptional water quality for beer making, given its position on the top of the mountains in the Strzelecki ranges. After extensive product testing to achieve the highest standards in pure beer, Grand Ridge commenced brewing in June 1989.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrand Ridge is at the top of the list in high quality beers. All the beers are produced to exceptionally high standards of flavour and purity, with no added chemicals or preservatives.  This typically results in a far less severe hangover, if any at all.\r\n\r\nAt Grand Ridge the quality of the beer is never compromised. The mission at Grand Ridge is always to make the best beer in the world. Grand Ridge is a 100% Australian, family owned company.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the Grand Ridge beers has been recognized with over 160 Australian and International beer awards. In 2002 at the Australian and International beer Awards Grand Ridge won 29 medals. This was more than any other brewery in the world including all 19 countries represented.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Grand Ridge won 21 medals including 6 best of class winners (double any other brewery in the world). In 2002, 2003 and 2005 Grand Ridge won Victoria's best beer for the Premiers Trophy along with 62 other international medals. Grand Ridge has won the title for Australia's best Lager, Ale, Dark, Stout, Wheat and Light beer categories. This trend has continued through to 2011 where Grand Ridge won 12 more International medals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrand Ridge was chosen to be the exclusive beer supplier for the Royal Melbourne Show in 2007 and 2008 and is currently the preferred supplier to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.","website":"http:\/\/www.grand-ridge.com.au\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XxRA3s\/upload_t0OEwK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XxRA3s\/upload_t0OEwK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XxRA3s\/upload_t0OEwK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XxRA3s\/upload_t0OEwK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XxRA3s\/upload_t0OEwK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-27 18:45:38","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SAtbDP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 Baromi Road","locality":"Mirboo North","region":"Victoria","postalCode":"3781","phone":"03 5668 2222","website":"http:\/\/www.grand-ridge.com.au\/","latitude":-38.4009674,"longitude":146.1627082,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-28 00:35:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Bzl1Jw","name":"Solar Coaster","nameDisplay":"Solar Coaster","abv":"6.1","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-05 02:56:49","updateDate":"2014-09-07 16:54:32","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.
