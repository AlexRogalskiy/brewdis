It\u2019s a place where we build our hopes and dreams, storing them on the wall neat as garden tools. Really, the garage is a hub. A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing. This brewery celebrates determination, knowledge, and the humble pride we wave like a battle flag.","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonBrewingCompany\/app_100265896690345?ref=page_internal","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:09:40","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:36:24","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"G851P7EZKA","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"JZyJiP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 W. 7th","locality":"Covington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41011","phone":"859-261-5600","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","latitude":39.0829077,"longitude":-84.5109181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 17:33:55","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:29:43","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LgDR9B","name":"Braxton Labs","streetAddress":"95 Riviera Dr.","locality":"Bellevue","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41073","phone":"859-291-0036","website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonLabs\/","latitude":39.1001948,"longitude":-84.4877355,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","updateDate":"2017-08-23 13:21:29","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-11:00pm,fri-11:00am-12:00am,sat-11:00am-12:00am,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jFlcRo","name":"Claussenii - The Fresh Oak Brett Project","nameDisplay":"Claussenii - The Fresh Oak Brett Project","description":"Our Sour Ale Program at Upland has been an adventure into the unknown from the beginning.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.

By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches. \r\n\r\nThe passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.\r\n\r\nAn art as much as a science, beer making depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients. \r\n\r\nPremium brewing employs a time-honoured process in which natural ingredients are blended in myriad combinations and brewed in small batches to produce beers that range from contemporary light brews to 'Old World' dark stouts.","website":"http:\/\/www.sleeman.ca\/","established":"1851","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"q878Wn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"551 Clair Road West","locality":"Guelph","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"0","phone":"1-519-822-1834","latitude":43.4870365,"longitude":-80.2067709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4Gw8jv","name":"Clear + Present Dankness","nameDisplay":"Clear + Present Dankness","description":"Collaboration with Cellarmaker.

Black House has the full-body, robust chocolatey flavor, and intense coffee aroma of its imperial counterparts, but packed into a 5.8% ABV package. Blazing World combines the subtly fruity qualities of a dry amber ale with the enormous hop-profile of an \u00fcber-dank double IPA.\r\n\r\nLomaland, our flagship saison, isn\u2019t so much a hybrid, as a return to origin\u2014a quenching, sessionable, farmhouse libation.

After meeting in 2008, their shared passion for craft beer was discovered, and then Aaron and Bobby started brewing together. Recipes were perfected and bigger systems were purchased over the years. Popularity grew and word got around about their beer. The requests for their beer started to reach beyond just family and friends and soon requests from brides and grooms, fund raising events, and private events began to pour in. The \u201cproblem\u201d of having too much beer on hand from wanting to brew so often soon turned into managing brew schedules and starting a waiting list for their beer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2012 Aaron and Bobby, along with their good friend Levi Schaljo, collaborated with Mother Earth Brew Co. to brew a special batch of beer for seven fallen Marines. The beer was named Homage. Thanks to Mother Earth Brew Co. the boys were able to brew 310 gallons of Homage. With help from many volunteers, over 450 \u2013 22oz. bottles were bottled, labeled by hand, and distributed to the squadron and families of the fallen. The remainder of the beer was sold at a private event at Mother Earth Brew Co. and the proceeds went to purchasing shadow boxes for the families to display their loved one\u2019s medals. The proceeds also went to the squadron to help pay for funeral costs. It was then that inspiration to brew for others took over and the trio began to develop a plan to take their operation to the next level and brew professionally.\r\n\r\nAaron, Anne and Bobby began planning to build a brewery and a business. Anne began working at Mother Earth Brew Co. to gain experience in the operations of a taproom and the operational side of a brewery.  Aaron and Bobby continued to brew their array of recipes, catering to the Oceanside area.\r\n\r\nWhen Bobby and Aaron came up with the idea to be professional brewers, they knew they wanted to give back through their beer, but they also wanted their beer and their brewery to represent them. It was quickly decided that the brewery had to be focused around the outdoors. Aaron and Anne grew up in the Northwest and Bobby grew up in upstate New York, and all are avid outdoorsmen. They wanted to bring what they love most about their upbringings to Southern California and that is what inspired the name and the concept of Northern Pine Brewing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are so many elements from home that people would love and appreciate here in Oceanside, and we are excited to bring those to people through Northern Pine Brewing\u201d \u2013 Aaron Ortega.","website":"http:\/\/northernpinebrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/VqSiej\/upload_l0ibUO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:34:56","updateDate":"2019-08-08 13:46:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7E45S18DLH","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"U5vEqe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"326 North Horne Street","locality":"Oceanside","region":"California","postalCode":"92054","phone":"(760) 754-1434","website":"http:\/\/northernpinebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","latitude":33.1998358,"longitude":-117.3769334,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:34:58","updateDate":"2018-08-17 18:34:58","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nTuesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nWednesday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nThursday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM,\nFriday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 11:00 AM \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 11:00 AM \u2013 9:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZRduFp","name":"Clear Coast Mango Guava","nameDisplay":"Clear Coast Mango Guava","description":"Clear Coast, Michigan\u2019s fresh hard seltzer, made with fresh water and hints of tantalizing fruit flavors. \r\n\r\nInspired by the world\u2019s longest freshwater coastline, Perrin Brewing creates a crisp, clean, pure seltzer \u2013 the choice is clear. \r\nCoast into good times\r\n\r\nMango & Guava\r\n*Gluten reduced*","abv":"5","styleId":161,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZRduFp\/upload_Ewxyey-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZRduFp\/upload_Ewxyey-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZRduFp\/upload_Ewxyey-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZRduFp\/upload_Ewxyey-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZRduFp\/upload_Ewxyey-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/ZRduFp\/upload_Ewxyey-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-12-18 14:41:11","updateDate":"2019-02-25 18:52:03","style":{"id":161,"categoryId":14,"category":{"id":14,"name":"Malternative Beverages","description":"Malternative Beverages, also known as \"ready-to-drink\" beverages, are sweet, sometime carbonated, beverages that are low in alcohol.","createDate":"2014-07-10 14:11:26","updateDate":"2014-07-10 14:20:24"},"name":"Flavored Malt Beverage","shortName":"Flavored Malt Beverage","description":"Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that are different from traditional malt beverages like malt liquor, ales, and lagers in several aspects.
