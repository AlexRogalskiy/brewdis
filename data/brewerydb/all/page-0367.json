At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"BY7YBW","name":"Other Half Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Other Half","description":"Craft Brewery specializing in IPA's and Sours","website":"http:\/\/otherhalfbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BY7YBW\/upload_38NPqk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-26 11:54:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"98GVKLAQRC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Z2TDwn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Centre St","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11231","phone":"345-987-3527","website":"http:\/\/www.otherhalfbrewing.com","latitude":40.6738126,"longitude":-73.9991345,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-26 11:55:42","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:45:12","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"5:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-5:00pm-10:00pm,wed-5:00pm-10:00pm,thu-5:00pm-10:00pm,fri-5:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"mr5nrC","name":"Other Half Brewing Company: Rochester","streetAddress":"6621 State Rte 5 And 20","locality":"Bloomfield","region":"New York","phone":"(585) 617-0453","website":"https:\/\/otherhalfbrewing.com","latitude":42.8824234,"longitude":-77.3924087,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-03-14 18:09:00","updateDate":"2019-03-14 18:09:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Txz7Zd","name":"Citra 7 IPA","nameDisplay":"Citra 7 IPA","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Txz7Zd\/upload_legji0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Txz7Zd\/upload_legji0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Txz7Zd\/upload_legji0-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Txz7Zd\/upload_legji0-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Txz7Zd\/upload_legji0-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Txz7Zd\/upload_legji0-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-29 03:28:09","updateDate":"2019-07-12 14:51:29","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SgctbA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-281-2437","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","latitude":45.540795,"longitude":-122.675594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"hops":[{"id":1946,"name":"Alchemy","category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:40"},{"id":27,"name":"Citra","description":"Comprised of Hallertau Mittelfr\u00fch, US Tettnang, Brewer's Gold and East Kent Golding","alphaAcidMin":11,"alphaAcidMax":13,"betaAcidMin":3.5,"betaAcidMax":4.5,"humuleneMin":11,"humuleneMax":13,"caryophylleneMin":6,"caryophylleneMax":8,"cohumuloneMin":22,"cohumuloneMax":24,"myrceneMin":60,"myrceneMax":65,"farneseneMax":1,"isNoble":"N","forBittering":"N","forFlavor":"Y","forAroma":"Y","category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:28","updateDate":"2015-09-24 13:38:05"}],"malt":[{"id":382,"name":"Caramel\/Crystal Malt 10L","characteristics":[{"id":3,"name":"Body","description":"Increases the body of the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":5,"name":"Caramel","description":"Imparts a caramel quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":9,"name":"Head","description":"Helps the head retention of the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":14,"name":"Sweet","description":"Imparts a sweet flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:45"},{"id":1922,"name":"Two-Row Pale Malt","description":"The is the standard starting point for almost all beer recipes.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Farmer Russell has ordered our new additions and will be breaking ground this February.

Since precolonial times the creek has been known as the Lickinghole where wildlife stopped to drink from the nourishing waters.
