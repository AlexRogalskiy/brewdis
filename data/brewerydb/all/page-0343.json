The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"dmMMzH","name":"Dark City Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Dark City","website":"http:\/\/www.darkcitybrewing.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dmMMzH\/upload_GWupxX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dmMMzH\/upload_GWupxX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dmMMzH\/upload_GWupxX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dmMMzH\/upload_GWupxX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/dmMMzH\/upload_GWupxX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-12 00:49:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:23:26","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"5XUTZHM80R","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"MBwjWw","name":"Main","streetAddress":"801 2nd Ave.","locality":"Asbury Park","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"07712","phone":"732-455-3792","website":"http:\/\/www.darkcitybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thurs - Fri: 5-9PM\r\nSat - Sun: 12-6PM","latitude":40.222503,"longitude":-74.0110589,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-12 01:20:07","updateDate":"2016-01-12 16:20:37","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thurs - Fri: 5-9PM\r\nSat - Sun: 12-6PM","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qtX6H4","name":"Charter Oak Abbey Dubbel","nameDisplay":"Charter Oak Abbey Dubbel","description":"Our beer offerings would not be complete without including a wonderful Belgian styled beer; we chose Charter Oak's Abbey Dubbel.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Brettanomyces produced flavors and aromas are not part of character. A fruity-estery character which is often cherry-like is apparent with no hop flavor or aroma. Flanders brown ales have low to medium bitterness and a cocoa-like character from roast malt. Roasted malt character in aroma and flavor is acceptable at low levels. A very low degree of malt sweetness may be present and in balance with the acidity produced by Lactobacillus activity. Oak-like or woody characters may be pleasantly integrated into overall palate. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Some versions may be more highly carbonated and, when bottle conditioned, may appear cloudy (yeast) when served. These final beers are often blended old with new before packaging in order to create the brewer's intended balance of characters.","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"6.5","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:39"},"breweries":[{"id":"oT2zAL","name":"There Be Dragons Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"There Be Dragons","website":"http:\/\/therebedragonsbrewing.chasingharvest.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-10 18:50:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"k4rTkY","name":"There Be Dragons Brewing","streetAddress":"891 Wanaka-Luggate Hwy","locality":"Wanaka","postalCode":"9382","latitude":-44.7226785,"longitude":169.2399197,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-10 18:55:36","updateDate":"2018-07-10 18:56:35","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jZ32cL","name":"Chasing Rabbits","nameDisplay":"Chasing Rabbits","description":"A hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call.

In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah.
