A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character.

The brewery provides a casual, laid-back atmosphere where friends can gather and families can enjoy time together in beautiful downtown Greenfield.  Wooden Bear is located in the former Gant Opera House, which opened in 1895 just next door to Greenfield\u2019s first firehouse.  All of our beers are hand-crafted with a lot of love, a little hops and the hope of making fellow craft beer lovers smile.","website":"http:\/\/woodenbearbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"brewer@woodenbearbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iSg2uM\/upload_iWlrOk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iSg2uM\/upload_iWlrOk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iSg2uM\/upload_iWlrOk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iSg2uM\/upload_iWlrOk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/iSg2uM\/upload_iWlrOk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-08 15:06:25","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:35:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PQGRVKHMJT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"UdnvmI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21 West North Street","locality":"Greenfield","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46140","phone":"(317) 318-1221","website":"http:\/\/woodenbearbrewing.com\/","latitude":39.785846,"longitude":-85.770083,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-08 15:08:48","updateDate":"2015-05-08 15:08:48","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-10:00pm,fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kdbJkY","name":"Dank Drank IPA","nameDisplay":"Dank Drank IPA","description":"Hop-bursted west coast India pale ale","abv":"6.6","ibu":"66","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-06 12:56:22","updateDate":"2018-04-06 12:56:22","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
