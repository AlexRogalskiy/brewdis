We use a traditional yeast strain and Continental hops that in combination imbue an aroma with a mild spiciness tempered with fruit. The beer is medium-bodied, with a slight acidity. It is effervescent and dry, with an edge of bitterness that balances the fruitiness of the aroma. A yeast-derived refreshing, spicy ale.","abv":"6.7","glasswareId":8,"availableId":1,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YbTw2I\/upload_rLOYHx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YbTw2I\/upload_rLOYHx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YbTw2I\/upload_rLOYHx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YbTw2I\/upload_rLOYHx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YbTw2I\/upload_rLOYHx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YbTw2I\/upload_rLOYHx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-02 16:47:27","updateDate":"2017-08-30 16:50:16","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Our saison takes that idea and gives it a little twist.  We use pink peppercorns and a mountain of late addition hops to add a spicy, fruity, citrus aroma and flavor.  Add in the four types of malt and the French yeast and you have a beer with intricate flavors and aromas all the way through.  Do some yard work and pretend you are a Belgian-French farmer enjoying the fruits of your labor brought forth in this remarkable, refreshing brew.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"36","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MDqarA\/upload_arrl9r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MDqarA\/upload_arrl9r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MDqarA\/upload_arrl9r-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MDqarA\/upload_arrl9r-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MDqarA\/upload_arrl9r-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MDqarA\/upload_arrl9r-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-11 19:16:38","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:05:42","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
