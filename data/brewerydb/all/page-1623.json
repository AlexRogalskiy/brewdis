Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"VDaU2A","name":"Abide Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Abide","description":"Abide Brewing Company is proud to be the first brewery in Newnan, Georgia.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"UeHiX0","name":"Badger Hill Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Badger Hill","description":"A family united by a hankering for travel and craft beer.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"nvfMg1","name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Cambridge","description":"CBC blends a passion for fresh, flavorful beer and delicious, imaginative cuisine to create a one-of-a-kind dining experience for greater Boston.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"EqYxQd","name":"Fort George Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Fort George","description":"The Fort George Brewery + Public House was the original settlement site of Astoria founded in March 1811 by Captain Jonathan Thorn.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style.

Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

They brewed their beers and served them at the Blue Moose Caf\u00e9 and Brewpub in 2013. The beers were a huge success.

I don't know that we recognized at the time that it was a life altering event; but, mostly out of desire to have more mead in our lives that measured up to the quality we had experienced from them we decided to start making our own.  Having no local meadmakers to draw from, this gave us the luxury of being unafraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients not associated with meads.  Some experiments failed and others worked great, all had a powerful influence on how we saw mead and what we thought mead could be.\r\nLike any hobby we dove face first into meadmaking.  Our goal was simple, to create memorable experiences through mead using locally produced ingredients to the extent possible.  Soon we were sharing those meads with friends and they shared them with others. I suppose a phenomenon of sorts was born and fast forward another year and we're being invited to pour at local festivals.\r\nIn early 2016 we decided to make Garagiste Meadery a legitimate business.  The original concept was a side job of sorts, we'd make mead between our other day jobs.  In April 2016 we launched a crowdfunding campaign to get started.  Without much expectations or fanfare we put ourselves out there.  The campaign closed a month later making Garagiste Meadery the largest publicly funded Meadery in history by a wide margin.\r\nAfter some soul searching we decided that we'd throw our fate to the winds and let the voice of the people be heard.  Garagiste Meadery would be a full Meadery with a Tasting Room and become our family business.  As the Meadery came together we felt the impetus to get better.  \r\nThankfully, some great meadmakers embraced us and helped refine Garagiste Meadery to where we are today.  \r\nCome on in, experience mead with us.  The exploration continues and we're thrilled to have you along for the ride.","website":"https:\/\/www.garagistemeadery.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/UGevtT\/upload_5ZIgVa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-12-13 21:55:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ph98Iu","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1506 N.
