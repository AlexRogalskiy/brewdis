If a more relaxing day is preferred, people can enjoy fishing, hiking, camping, sailing, antiquing, and bird watching or simply kicking back and taking in the spectacular views of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.","website":"http:\/\/www.kernriverbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/E1zSFp\/upload_c3bNOc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:11:18","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"PR104CN983","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"sIBGId","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"13415 Sierra Highway","locality":"Kernville","region":"California","postalCode":"93238","phone":"760-376-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.kernriverbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":35.757512,"longitude":-118.419213,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kkznD1","name":"Thinking Of Something Orange","nameDisplay":"Thinking Of Something Orange","description":"Orange Blossom Honey Wheat.

This beer was designed for aging.","abv":"9","ibu":"50","styleId":158,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.077","createDate":"2016-11-17 16:34:49","updateDate":"2016-11-17 16:34:49","style":{"id":158,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Porter","shortName":"American Imperial Porter","description":"American-style imperial porters are black in color.

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2019-02-19 18:53:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4QN8KUSGF7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nyDPEA","name":"Third Wave IPA","nameDisplay":"Third Wave IPA","abv":"6.2","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nyDPEA\/upload_PJH8rV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nyDPEA\/upload_PJH8rV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nyDPEA\/upload_PJH8rV-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nyDPEA\/upload_PJH8rV-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nyDPEA\/upload_PJH8rV-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/nyDPEA\/upload_PJH8rV-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-23 17:19:27","updateDate":"2016-03-23 17:21:39","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars.

It was Christmas 2005 James Thompson got his best friend Mark Taylor a Mr. Beer homebrew kit as a gag gift. Mark admits that he put the kit away for a while because it seemed \"overwhelming\" at the time. Mark had already made homemade wines but just wasn't sure of the kit's complexity. About six months had passed and Mark found himself wandering the isles of a local homebrew shop and decided to take another go at making beer at home. He spent hundreds of hours over a period of seven years perfecting his recipes. He was obsessed with learning new brewing techniques and the beers became remarkable. In 2012, James approached Mark again with a new idea to open a brewery in Sacramento's burgeoning craft beer market. Big Sexy Brewing was no longer a cool idea it was a reality. The team started by collecting equipment and pooling together the cash to start the new venture. It took three years for the new co-founders to find a perfect location for the new brewery. They settled on a cool little-forgotten warehouse district tucked away in South East Sacramento. James with a background in business operations and marketing and Mark with his craft beer background realized quickly that they were going to need help. In 2015, they recruited Ryan Moore the Vice President of a local commercial bank as a partner and Chief Financial Officer and to round off the team in 2016, the Reilly Family (Pat & Sarah) joined as the companies financial partners. Big Sexy's doors opened on August 31st, 2016 and to this day still holds true to the original vision, \"Quality craft beers everyone can enjoy\".","website":"http:\/\/bigsexybrewing.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-12 14:56:48","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:02:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"USXT8EO7LB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"L4lH68","name":"Big Sexy Brewing Company","streetAddress":"5861 88TH St","extendedAddress":"Ste 800","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95828","phone":"916.374.7332","website":"https:\/\/www.bigsexybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Closed Mon and Tue","latitude":38.5202962,"longitude":-121.3751571,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-13 18:29:05","updateDate":"2018-07-13 18:29:05","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-2:00pm-8:00pm,thu-2:00pm-8:00pm,fri-2:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-8:00pm,sun-12:00pm-6:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Closed Mon and Tue","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Dl1p6O","name":"Thirst Degree","nameDisplay":"Thirst Degree","abv":"3.6","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-21 17:34:37","updateDate":"2012-12-21 17:34:38","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew.

A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family\u2019s, employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery\u2026Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.\r\n \r\nCan true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man\u2019s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to\u2026A madman\u2019s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.\r\n \r\nTrue patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what \u201cpour to the line\u201d means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin\u2026still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery\u2026 True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.\r\n \r\nSome things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t. No matter, as you\u2019re drinking some of the best fuckin\u2019 beer made in the great state of Michigan.
