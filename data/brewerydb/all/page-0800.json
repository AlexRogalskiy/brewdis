When you pour the Huger Street Wheat you instantly notice the bodacious head. The head is very inviting and releases a sneak peak to the complexity beneath. Approach this beer with an open mind and clear sinuses!  Close your eyes and inhale deeply. Reminiscent of a walk in the garden, you\u2019ll easily identify the floral notes of Confederate Jasmine and lowcountry pine straw. Just kidding, these are the aromas given to us by the generous helping of Chinook Hops. You\u2019ll also get the subtle waft of spices and flowers (mysterious and thought provoking images provided by the Crystal Hops).Take a deep soulful drink of this golden liquid. Breathe out and taste the grapefruit linger but not get bitter, as a burst of tropical fruit arrives on the scene. The sweet caramel wheat malt backbone and peppery clean finish of the rye support the aggressive late hop addition of Centennial and Galaxy Hops.\"","abv":"6.4","styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-12 19:37:55","updateDate":"2019-03-01 18:57:11","style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

To give Hugh Malone its hop character we use generous portions of Simcoe hops at three points in the brewing process. To begin with, we use a technique referred to as first wort hopping, in which Simcoe is added to the sweet wort as it enters the kettle. When the wort comes to a boil in the kettle we add Warrior hops, adding another layer to the bitterness of the beer. Later in the brewing process we steep a large amount of Simcoe in the whirlpool to impart a distinct hop aroma. Finally, during secondary fermentation in our conditioning tanks, we dry hop the beer, which instills a hoppy aroma with notes of pine and grapefruit. This 8.5 % ABV ale has a malty palate and a pronounced bitterness. It has a pleasant dry, hoppy finish. \r\n\r\nHugh Malone is a tribute to responsible agricultural practices and informed consumption. Allagash Brewing Company is donating $1 from every bottle of Hugh Malone sold to the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA), the country\u2019s oldest and largest state organic farmer coalition. MOFGA is a non-profit organization that educates farmers and gardeners about organic cultivation. They work to create resources for consumers interested in buying local and organic foods.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},{"id":"iY4EbX","name":"Hugs and Nugs","nameDisplay":"Hugs and Nugs","description":"Citra\/Cashmere in the boil.\r\nDDH w\/ Cashmere and Enigma","abv":"6","ibu":"20","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iY4EbX\/upload_3pWWQh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iY4EbX\/upload_3pWWQh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iY4EbX\/upload_3pWWQh-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iY4EbX\/upload_3pWWQh-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iY4EbX\/upload_3pWWQh-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/iY4EbX\/upload_3pWWQh-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-04-25 14:03:09","updateDate":"2018-04-25 14:04:18","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

This beer is made almost entirely from a traditional British Pale malt called Maris Otter, regarded around the world as one of the best beer making malts ever produced, with a little bit of CaraGold for sweetness and body, and some Torrified Wheat for keeping that nice white head all fluffy. \r\n Our Malt comes from Warminster Maltings, a traditional Victorian floor malt house just down the road in Wiltshire. They produce the finest malts available and are a thoroughly nice bunch. \r\n This beer is packed full of Citra hops. Citra is a wonderfully potent, resinous and ballsy hop. It\u2019s loaded with citrus notes and anything else your tastebuds may care to pick up, from guava to stone fruit. The hop has only been around since 2009 but has exploded onto the craft beer scene and has become a firm favourite for hop heads. \r\n The Citra is balanced with the more subtle, but wonderfully warm Summer hop from Australia, adding flavours like melon and apricot to round off the crazy citrus.","abv":"6","ibu":"45","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.057","createDate":"2015-07-30 14:44:00","updateDate":"2015-07-30 14:44:00","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
