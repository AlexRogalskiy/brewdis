Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner.

Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

At the beginning of the last century Mr Robustiano Riestra cut down a large tree, probably an eucalyptus, which was transported by two Asturian traditional carts to his house in Santa Olaya de Baldorn\u00f3n (Gij\u00f3n), where he built a beam press. Don Robustiano already marketed under the brand name RIESTRA and he even owned a store in the popular district of El Llano in Gij\u00f3n in the early years of the last century. Some years later, the company passed into the hands of his daughter Mrs. Etelvina Riestra who moved to the neighbouring municipality of Sariego when she got married to Mr Ricardo Riestra Hortal, where a new stage of the making of our cider began.\r\n\r\nWorking in those times was hard, laborious and very demanding, as they did not enjoy the technological advances which are available to us today. In 1947 a new cider cellar was built which meant both a major modernization and also a considerable increase of the production and the trading transactions. In 1985 Guzm\u00e1n Riestra Riestra took over management of the company, who, in turn, passed the baton to his sons Ra\u00fal and Ruben Riestra, who are currently continuing the work started by their great grandfather, placing this family saga among the most traditional ones of the cider makers' guild.\r\n\r\n2012 marks another step in the trajectory of this brand. The release of our first sparkling cider, Sidra Guzm\u00e1n Riestra.

Don Robustiano already marketed under the brand name RIESTRA and he even owned a store in the popular district of El Llano in Gij\u00f3n in the early years of the last century. Some years later, the company passed into the hands of his daughter Mrs. Etelvina Riestra who moved to the neighbouring municipality of Sariego when she got married to Mr Ricardo Riestra Hortal, where a new stage of the making of our cider began.\r\n\r\nWorking in those times was hard, laborious and very demanding, as they did not enjoy the technological advances which are available to us today. In 1947 a new cider cellar was built which meant both a major modernization and also a considerable increase of the production and the trading transactions. In 1985 Guzm\u00e1n Riestra Riestra took over management of the company, who, in turn, passed the baton to his sons Ra\u00fal and Ruben Riestra, who are currently continuing the work started by their great grandfather, placing this family saga among the most traditional ones of the cider makers' guild.\r\n\r\n2012 marks another step in the trajectory of this brand.

There would be much to say and tell it to start back over the key dates. In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world.
