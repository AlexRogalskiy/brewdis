Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Our Rad Red Amber Ale\u2019s extra hop kick takes this tradition of innovation a step further. Its solid hop presence, which comes from 100% American hops, is balanced by crunchy Caramel Malt, giving it a perfect amber color and chewy malt character. We kept the rest simple, using only Upland\u2019s own yeast ale blend and pure southern Indiana water for this drinkable yet refreshingly radical brew.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"55","glasswareId":5,"srmId":15,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MRDTCa\/upload_M74M1H-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MRDTCa\/upload_M74M1H-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MRDTCa\/upload_M74M1H-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MRDTCa\/upload_M74M1H-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MRDTCa\/upload_M74M1H-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/MRDTCa\/upload_M74M1H-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:01","updateDate":"2015-12-16 06:37:21","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":15,"name":"15","hex":"BB5100"},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
