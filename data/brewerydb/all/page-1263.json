It is a high foamy unfiltered light yellow beer whose cloudiness is caused by yeast and a high protein content. It goes especially well with steaks and meats such as roasted duck or pork. It is also lovely with meatballs, sausages, seafood and soft cheeses such as mozzarella. The beer itself should be very carefully poured into a typically tall slim glass slightly closed at the top, which keeps the rich and dense foamy head. Swirl the remaining beer in the bottle before finishing it to maximize the yeasty cloudiness. It can be served with a slice of lemon at a temperature of 6 - 8\u00b0C.

Not many examples of the style are available, especially locally, which is why we chose to brew it.  Consistent with our basic brewing philosophy, the mission for the Prime Minister is to provide north Texas with an exceptional example of the style, which may not be too familiar.  Prime Minister appears dark orange with complex fruity esters contributing to the aroma.  Its medium bodied with a malty\/caramelly sweetness.  Hop flavor is present and bitterness is light, but evident and balanced with the malt flavors present.  Fruity-ester flavors add to the character of this rich, somewhat sweet and complex beer.\r\nAs with many of our beers, this one\u2019s name comes with history.  Naming a beer isn\u2019t easy.  Iron Lady seemed the perfect  fit for an English strong due to the Margaret Thatcher reference.  However, our friends in Fort Worth, Martin House and Rahr, brew Iron Joe\/Thistle and Salty Lady, and Iron Lady seemed too close for comfort.  We settled on The Governor earlier in the year, but as the release date grew closer, we continued to conjure up hundreds of potential names.  The brewers dubbed it Large Marge (a nod to Margaret Thatcher, the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge, and PW\u2019s Big Adventure), but the strong Prime Minister ultimately won out.  The beer has one last super secret alias, but you\u2019ll have to ask Grayson about that one.\r\nWe released Prime Minister at our brewery on September 22, 2016.  Proper Baking Co. joined us and served up traditional English fare.  We also handed out glassware to commemorate the event.","abv":"8.6","ibu":"48","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-09-22 21:29:08","updateDate":"2016-09-22 21:29:08","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.
