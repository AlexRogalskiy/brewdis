Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish\/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:58:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"86OJN5RFTV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LoZU74","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Hurley Rd","extendedAddress":"Bldg 9A","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","latitude":41.4757351,"longitude":-73.1538361,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:37:56","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mgIFkX","name":"Bush Triple","nameDisplay":"Bush Triple","abv":"10","styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-06 18:59:47","updateDate":"2016-11-08 19:13:48","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

We keep it simple: brewing our ales and lagers fresh in small batches. We keep it real: all of our beers are unfiltered, unpasteurized, and contain no chemical additives or preservatives. And we keep it creative: producing a broad range of year-round and seasonal ales and lagers, and frequent brewer\u2019s specials. \r\n\r\nWe believe in staying relaxed, down-to-earth, and enjoying an abundance of great beer. There are no secrets here. We share our process, our culture, and of course, the final product \u2013 because that\u2019s the way we believe a craft brewery should be.\r\n Berkshire Brewing Company was founded in the fall of 1994 in historic South Deerfield, MA. Our founders shared a single purpose: to revive a time-honored tradition of high-quality craft brewing in this part of the region. By word of mouth \u2013 and taste buds \u2013 Berkshire\u2019s fresh, unfiltered, unpasteurized ales quickly became a success with beer drinkers throughout Western Massachusetts and beyond.\r\nIn the twenty years we\u2019ve been in the business, plenty has changed. Berkshire has grown from a small, distinguished microbrewery brewing seven barrels at a time to New England\u2019s premier regional craft brewery, distributing a broad range of year-round and seasonal ales and lagers to locations across New England.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve gotten this far by keeping a focus on fresh brewing, craftsmanship, and most importantly, people. As Berkshire Brewing Company continues to grow, we stay true to our original craft spirit. \r\n\r\n#JustGoodBeer","website":"http:\/\/www.berkshire-brewing.com","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:11:25","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LMUN8YXQVD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"eZVnaZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12 Railroad Street","locality":"South Deerfield","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01373","phone":"413- 665-6600","website":"http:\/\/www.berkshirebrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":42.478684,"longitude":-72.609409,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RHusVl","name":"Buskey Salted Caramel Cider","nameDisplay":"Buskey Salted Caramel Cider","description":"Caramel and sea salt.

Blending these barrels into funky, complex and sometimes sour beer is an historical art form that we celebrate in our space.\r\n\r\nOur experimentation also extends to that most important of beer ingredients, yeast. Many Springdale beers are fermented with classic ale yeast strains, rather than our parent brewery\u2019s lager yeasts. These yeasts express themselves in our beers with spicy, fruity characteristics that are classic in many styles that we have have long loved, such as saison.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the ideal that beer needs to remain fun.

Here is a little rundown about what Fifty West is all about:\r\n\r\nAll the beers brewed at Fifty West Brewing Company have been hand made in small batches with a focus on craftsmanship, tradition, innovation, and patience.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why we selected the name \u2018Fifty West\u2019; the most obvious being the fact that our brewery is located on Route 50, which extends from Coast to Coast- it spans more than 3,000 miles starting in Maryland and stretching all the way to California. \r\n\r\nThe brewery is located in a building that has a vast and varied transient history (http:\/\/www.cincinnati.com\/dining\/heritage\/history.html); from the settlers heading west through the Ohio River valley, to the days of Prohibition when our building was a favorite of George Remus and the bootleggers running whiskey from Cincinnati to Chicago, to where we are today\u2014amidst a renaissance of the craft beer movement.\r\n\r\nTo us, it\u2019s not about the destination, but instead making sure we are enjoying the journey, appreciating the moment, and brewing beers that are enjoyed by anyone who is willing to let us become a part of their journey.","website":"http:\/\/www.fiftywestbrew.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/832aZM\/upload_6Rv25q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/832aZM\/upload_6Rv25q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/832aZM\/upload_6Rv25q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/832aZM\/upload_6Rv25q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/832aZM\/upload_6Rv25q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-25 12:10:16","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:03","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"DQKW64105Y","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qa1QZU","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7668 Wooster Pike","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45227","phone":"(440) 477-0163","website":"http:\/\/www.fiftywestbrew.com\/","latitude":39.138724,"longitude":-84.353144,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-25 12:10:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
