For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-07-10 21:56:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"BJ7YQKPT31","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"yqQtUG","name":"Brewery & Restaurant","streetAddress":"21 Second Street","locality":"Athens","region":"New York","postalCode":"12015","phone":"518-945-2337","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon, Wed & Thurs.: 4:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nFriday: 4:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSaturday: 1:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSunday: 1:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nClosed Tuesdays","latitude":42.260511,"longitude":-73.8096826,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon, Wed & Thurs.: 4:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nFriday: 4:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSaturday: 1:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSunday: 1:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nClosed Tuesdays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"r3LnBh","name":"Crossroads Brewing Company-Catskill Taproom","streetAddress":"201 Water Street","locality":"Catskill","region":"New York","postalCode":"12414","phone":"5184448277","latitude":42.2208002,"longitude":-73.8677725,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2017","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-10 21:38:28","updateDate":"2019-07-11 14:07:30","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"1:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-4:00pm-9:00pm,thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-10:00pm,sat-1:00pm-10:00pm,sun-1:00pm-8:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}],"ingredients":{"malt":[{"id":429,"name":"Chocolate Malt","description":"A dark malt that gives a rich red or brown color and a nutty flavor, used in brown ales, porters, and some stouts.","countryOfOrigin":"US","srmId":41,"srmPrecise":350,"moistureContent":4,"coarseFineDifference":1.5,"dryYield":60,"potential":1.028,"protein":13.2,"maxInBatch":10,"maltType":0,"requiresMashing":"N","characteristics":[{"id":6,"name":"Chocolate","description":"Imparts a chocolate quality upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":7,"name":"Coffee","description":"Imparts a coffee flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":11,"name":"Nutty","description":"Imparts a nutty flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"},{"id":15,"name":"Toasted","description":"Imparts a toasted flavor upon the beer.","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:26"}],"category":"malt","categoryDisplay":"Malts, Grains, & Fermentables","createDate":"2013-06-24 16:07:47","updateDate":"2013-06-24 16:10:14","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":753,"name":"Barley - Roasted","description":"Unmalted and roasted at high temperature to create a burnt, grainy, coffee-like flavor.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"AdZe7l","name":"McLeod's","nameShortDisplay":"McLeod's","description":"Surf, sand, Scottish heritage - it's all a part of the mix here! If ever a brewery was born to endorse the world\u2019s first kilt-required surfing competition, McLeod\u2019s Brewery is it. Of course, it hasn\u2019t been all rainbows and longboards. It took us a while to get here.\r\n\r\nWe spent childhood summers burning our feet on the sand and riding waves in Waipu Cove. This slice of delicious Pacific paradise was home-away-from-home when we were wee ones, so when it came time to kick corporate life to the kerb, we knew where to go.\r\n\r\nWaipu\u2019s Pizza Barn was already a \u2018thing\u2019 when we bought it in 2003, but we quickly put our fingerprint on it (i.e. draped in more tartan than a McLeod within earshot of Dunvegan). We then hired half the village and worked right alongside them in the kitchen and at the bar - and still do! We even created a menu we loved. All was grand \u2026except the beer.\r\n\r\nBig fans of craft beer from travels abroad, we craved brews bold in flavour and wholly authentic. We also wanted to make it right out back. So we did.\r\n\r\nTapping into local immigrant Scottish heritage, we found a name (Brothers Gwynne Brewing didn't have quite the same \u2018ring\u2019). After launching in 2014 \u2013 with a few \u2018starts\u2019 and \u2018stops\u2019 - here we are and there you are reading this. You know what they say about overnight success, though? It takes ten years and then some. But it's all good, and we're enjoying the ride..\r\n\r\nWe now have a great \u2018brew crew\u2019 which includes Head Brewer Jason Bathgate who\u2019s worked for no less than two champion New Zealand breweries. At his side and with us since Day One is Assistant Brewer Milton Mewett. All of us work hard and love what we do. Not much more exciting than that, really. Truth be told, we\u2019re pretty keen to get that surf compo organized. Like our beers, it could be great fun and nothing short of pure dead brilliant.\r\n\r\nSlainte!\r\n\r\nGeoff & Clayton Gwynne","website":"http:\/\/www.mcleodsbrewery.co.nz","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/AdZe7l\/upload_x0cyxp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-09 01:10:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"mptyoj","name":"McLeod's","streetAddress":"2 Cove Road","locality":"Waipu","region":"Northland","postalCode":"0510","phone":"64) 21361118","website":"http:\/\/www.mcleodsbrewery.co.nz","latitude":-35.9850852,"longitude":174.4477751,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-09 17:34:46","updateDate":"2018-08-09 17:36:37","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OddxMk","name":"Black Saddle","nameDisplay":"Black Saddle","description":"Black Saddle Stout is an imperial stout brewed in the Russian Imperial Stout style \u2013 dark, thick, complex, and roasty, with hints of dark fruit and chocolate.

The authors of the style tried to brew a beer which was very similar to IPA in terms of aroma and taste but had a deep black color. The problem which the brewer encountered was that dark malts used to brew dark beer tend to add a coffee-chocolate-burnt flavors and aromas - the characteristics usually not associated with real IPA. Our beer has a distinctive aroma of citruses, tropical fruits, lemon, mango and a bit of pines, having a dry bitter taste full of hops. And a very very light touch of chocolate. But if you drink it with you eyes closed it would be very challenging to discover what is the color of the beer - black beer is usually associated with porters and stouts.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

Fruity-ester level is very low.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"24","abvMin":"3.2","abvMax":"4","srmMin":"17","srmMax":"34","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.008","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:20:43"},"breweries":[{"id":"ocqOOM","name":"Black Sheep Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Black Sheep","description":"Since 1992 Black Sheep Brewery has been brewing fantastic beers in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales.","website":"http:\/\/www.blacksheepbrewery.com\/","established":"1992","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ocqOOM\/upload_e2Q3I4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ocqOOM\/upload_e2Q3I4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ocqOOM\/upload_e2Q3I4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ocqOOM\/upload_e2Q3I4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ocqOOM\/upload_e2Q3I4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"rNstSX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Wellgarth","locality":"Ripon","region":"North Yorkshire","phone":"44-(01765)-689227","latitude":54.136795,"longitude":-1.523579,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6fM03D","name":"Black Sheep Black IPA","nameDisplay":"Black Sheep Black IPA","description":"Black IPA.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
