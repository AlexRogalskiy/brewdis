For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage.

We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

It\u2019s a beast, but it\u2019s OUR beast\u2026and we think it\u2019s beautiful.\r\n\r\nOriginating as a cask-only version of our Tankhouse Ale, Tankenstein is a dry-hopped IPA with full body and matching bitterness. It is a perfectly balanced ale with caramel and biscuit malts complementing the dryness of US grown bittering hops but with a massive over-lay of American Cascade hops being added to the tank during ageing to \u201cdry-hop\u201d the beer and give it a wonderful perfumey character. Grapefruit and piney resinous tones are the main contribution of the Cascades and make this a truly classic American-style IPA.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
