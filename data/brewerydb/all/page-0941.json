Leota Mae joins the Bale Breaker lineup with a fresh take on a heavily hopped West Coast IPA. With late additions of Ekuanot\u2122 and Mosaic\u00ae, this beer veers into dank, tropical territory, highlighting the aromatic power of these two Yakima-bred varietals. \r\n\r\nOur great-grandparents planted hops in the Yakima Valley in 1932. The matriarch of our family, Leota Mae, worked sunrise to sunset cultivating the land we still farm today. This beer pays tribute to our family\u2019s legacy and the woman who started it all. Cheers, Leota Mae, here's your IPA. \r\n\r\n**Please Note: All Bale Breaker beer is heavily hopped and unfiltered, so some sediment may be present.","abv":"6.2","ibu":"50","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-13 03:51:18","updateDate":"2018-10-23 15:53:05","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
