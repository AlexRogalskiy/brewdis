This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"sXgFVK","name":"De Garde Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"De Garde","description":"We are a small rural brewery specializing in many diverse styles of ales, but with a focus on spontaneous fermentations inspired by the European farmhouse traditions.","website":"http:\/\/degardebrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/sXgFVK\/upload_Eovl35-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-12 22:49:50","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:27:35","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"BYV8OXPA5I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"1tpoam","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6000 Blimp Blvd","extendedAddress":"Unit A","locality":"Tillamook","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97141","phone":"(503) 815-1635","website":"http:\/\/degardebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSun:  11:00am - 5:00pm","latitude":45.4207631,"longitude":-123.7999426,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-12 22:49:50","updateDate":"2017-08-22 16:14:42","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\r\nSun:  11:00am - 5:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CpJNgm","name":"Descendant","nameDisplay":"Descendant","description":"Mystic Descendant is a beer descended from the cultural history of the Boston harbor area.

One of these was brewing . . . beer. Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today\u2019s market, but the goofy and \u201cjust OK\u201d beers that home brewers in the 90\u2019s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we\u2019ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity\u2019s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.\r\n\r\nChris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OdysseyBeerwerks\/app_100265896690345","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_3hGy4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:24:36","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:41:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"KFRB2G1TQ7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"I4hZZy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5535 W 56th Ave,","extendedAddress":"Suite 107","locality":"Arvada","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80002","phone":"(303) 421-0772","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","latitude":39.8007911,"longitude":-105.0589359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:42:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uJcWCJ","name":"Desert Brown","nameDisplay":"Desert Brown","description":"Surprisingly dry, this earthy brown ale starts out with rich chocolate, caramel and dark fruit notes.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Wine making was forever implanted into his life and who he has become today.\r\nAs an adult, he began making wine at home himself, as well as brewing his own beer and other fermented creations. This exploration of crafting his own fermented beverages brought him to his discovery of mead which took his creativity and passion by storm.\r\nToday, he has become a notable award-winning mead maker who's products have wowed even the most discerning and educated of palates. He also serves on the board of directors for the American Mead Makers Assosication and is the owner of the fastest growing meadery in the country.\r\nMelovino Meadery's gauge of success is not based on the number of awards we have won, although those are nice. Instead, our main focus at the meadery is making mead that our fans will love, and that we would love to drink too! That means using nothing but top quality ingredients, such as True Source Certified honey and reverse osmosis water.
