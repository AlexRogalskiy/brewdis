If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"6IytVz","name":"Garrison Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Garrison","description":"Garrison Brewing Company will strive to create premium, full-flavored beer that fully deserves the pride and support of Halifax and Nova Scotia residents alike.

In 2010 we planted our flag in Downtown Fresno, CA and decided to take our journey of becoming the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s local brewery a step further. Our beer and brands reflect the greatness of the region we brew in. We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master\/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.\r\n\r\nAll Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California. We recently renovated our grain warehouse to become a tasting room in a Beer Garden style fashion. Our hope is that the #TSBeerGarden will bring new life to our city\u2019s downtown with an outdoor venue that provides a unique variety of fresh, local craft beer with an urban atmosphere. We host numerous types of events monthly that include live music, art shows, and food trucks. The Beer Garden has regular hours for onsite consumption with bottles, kegs and growlers to go.","website":"http:\/\/www.tioga-sequoia.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 16:26:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wdjaPp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"745 Fulton St.","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","phone":"(559) 486-2337","latitude":36.7314814,"longitude":-119.7881204,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","updateDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gnWknS","name":"Sugarbear Quad","nameDisplay":"Sugarbear Quad","description":"Spring is here and the beast has awoken from hibernation!

Our founders shared a single purpose: to revive a time-honored tradition of high-quality craft brewing in this part of the region. By word of mouth \u2013 and taste buds \u2013 Berkshire\u2019s fresh, unfiltered, unpasteurized ales quickly became a success with beer drinkers throughout Western Massachusetts and beyond.\r\nIn the twenty years we\u2019ve been in the business, plenty has changed. Berkshire has grown from a small, distinguished microbrewery brewing seven barrels at a time to New England\u2019s premier regional craft brewery, distributing a broad range of year-round and seasonal ales and lagers to locations across New England.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve gotten this far by keeping a focus on fresh brewing, craftsmanship, and most importantly, people. As Berkshire Brewing Company continues to grow, we stay true to our original craft spirit. \r\n\r\n#JustGoodBeer","website":"http:\/\/www.berkshire-brewing.com","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XsC59I\/upload_A3pody-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:11:25","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LMUN8YXQVD","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"eZVnaZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12 Railroad Street","locality":"South Deerfield","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01373","phone":"413- 665-6600","website":"http:\/\/www.berkshirebrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":42.478684,"longitude":-72.609409,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"whTS0R","name":"Sugarmaker","nameDisplay":"Sugarmaker","description":"Imperial milk stout brewed with vanilla and maple syrup.","abv":"11.5","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-02-20 19:18:29","updateDate":"2017-02-20 19:18:29","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.
