This recipe was inspired by a particular favourite dish on HOME\u2019s menu; Pigeon breast with game ragout, fennel and truffled pomme souffl\u00e9. The idea was for the sweetness of the malt to rest nicely alongside the balance of flavours in the dish, with the subtle liquorice notes harmonising with the fennel ketchup. We created this beer with the view that not only could it be enjoyed alone, but as a beer pairing with their menu to offer insight to how incredible a pairing between food and beer can be.\r\n\r\nTo compliment the flavours of the dish (the rich, irony, gamey flavours alongside a sour medicinal rooty flavour from the fennel) we realised that a beer inspired by Pontefract cake would be a perfect pairing. Not only that, it was also a personal favourite of chef Elizabeth\u2019s mum; a flavour that she really associated with her childhood, exemplifying HOME\u2019s MO of reimagining familiar and nostalgic flavours; plus it only seemed right that a collaboration between two progressive names in Northern food and drink that share so many of the same values should pay homage to Yorkshire food & drink heritage!\r\n\r\nWe felt this flavour profile would complement a darker style of beer which led us down the path of an India porter!","abv":"6","ibu":"20","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/C3UsuY\/upload_2gKOVY-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-10-08 14:39:34","updateDate":"2018-10-08 14:41:08","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

The flavour is led by the earthy spice from the malted rye, whilst being backed up with the silky, nutty contribution of the oats.\r\n\r\nThe dark colour essential to black IPAs has come from Carafa Spezial III and Sinamar. Taking what we learned from our last patrons project with Ricky Lightfoot and Moor, Watching Crag, we wanted to minimize the dark roast flavour and make a black IPA which is as soft and juicy as possible.\r\n\r\nThe first hops went in at the whirlpool stage. We chose a favourite of ours in the form of Mosaic alongside Zythos, an unsung US hop which brings ripe pineapple and zingy grapefruit flavours.
