These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"FUOlYc","name":"Pikes Peak Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Pikes Peak","description":"We established our Monument, Colorado brewery in 2011 as a place for our community to connect and come together.

The variety of ways they can be used in brewing and the range of flavors and aromas that they bring to beer are vast and areas in which we enjoy experimenting heavily. No surprise then that the word \"hop\" appears in our name and that the majority of our recipes begin with a specific variety or intuitive blend of hops in mind.\r\n\r\nHow we are inspired by the \"Butcher\" portion of our namesake is thankfully less bloody than the history behind it, but there are a lot of butcher-esque traits that we do draw inspiration from. All of the ones we grew up around were approachable, dependable and visibly and vocally passionate about their craft. They'd take the time to get to know you, get technical when necessary and if you wanted it, help you find something or make a recommendation. That's who we aim to be, except with hops, yeast, water and grain in a brewery instead of a butcher shop and a meat-filled counter.\r\n\r\nFinally, at some point, you'll refer to us simply as \"Hop Butcher\" (and we're cool with that), but the \"For The World\" part is an important and meaningful element of our name. It inspires the ingredients we use and the personality behind the beers we brew: unique enough for the beer geeks, approachable enough for the newcomers. It guides who we work with and where our cans and kegs are distributed...and where they might someday be distributed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHop Butcher For The World","website":"http:\/\/www.hopbutcher.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-12 16:22:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:50:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6BOINF90Y","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"mDFzjD","name":"Hop Butcher For The World","streetAddress":"1000 N.

The name Gentle Ben\u2019s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington. Martha was a mean bear by people standards and had to be kept chained to a stake. The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben\u2019s Brewing Company of Tucson\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations?

In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery\/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

Artifact is yours, as much as it is ours.","website":"http:\/\/www.artifactcider.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CIs31G\/upload_IvuD13-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CIs31G\/upload_IvuD13-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CIs31G\/upload_IvuD13-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CIs31G\/upload_IvuD13-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/CIs31G\/upload_IvuD13-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-16 15:20:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"rlUOPS","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"270 Albany St. , MA","locality":"Springfield","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01105","phone":"(508) 446-2935","website":"http:\/\/www.artifactcider.com\/","latitude":42.120638,"longitude":-72.574443,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-16 15:23:50","updateDate":"2016-06-16 15:23:50","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LUTbDi","name":"Teachers Pet","nameDisplay":"Teachers Pet","styleId":119,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 02:06:46","updateDate":"2015-07-14 02:06:46","style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
