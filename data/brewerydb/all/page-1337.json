With this masterpiece in mind I brewed a Rustic Saison using wild yeast and local honey. Like its musical and vernal inspiration, Rite of Spring is characterized by both delicacy and dissonance. The aromas of spring flowers and fresh oranges that leap forth from the glass are cast against immense earthiness and rustic funk from the wild yeast. Notes of soft fruits, toasty malt, and subtle honey sweetness dance gently around a pronounced bitterness, and ultimately fade into a bone dry finish. As the gloom of winter yields to rebirth and revelry, throw some Stravinsky on your turntable, crack open a bottle with your friends, and join us in celebrating The Rite of Spring!
