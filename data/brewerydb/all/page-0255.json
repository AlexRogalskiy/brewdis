Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character. Hop aroma is usually moderately-high to overwhelmingly hop-floral, -citrus or -herbal. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.","ibuMin":"50","ibuMax":"80","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.08","fgMin":"1.02","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:49"},"breweries":[{"id":"mqrYK9","name":"Tuned Up Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Tuned Up","description":"Located in Southeast Pennsylvania in Spring City, PA, Tuned Up Brewing is getting ready to open it's doors to hard rock fans to come in and enjoy some real in your face brews!","website":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tunedupbrewing","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mqrYK9\/upload_cJnbe0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mqrYK9\/upload_cJnbe0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mqrYK9\/upload_cJnbe0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mqrYK9\/upload_cJnbe0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mqrYK9\/upload_cJnbe0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-18 23:07:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:57:59","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A8G6XNDE5I","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"atvOSd","name":"Tuned Up Brewing Company","streetAddress":"135 N.

Barley malt and wheat help create a smooth body and attribute a pleasant golden hue while the addition of malted rye and oats brings out a solid earthy flavor. Czech Saaz Hops help create a citrus nose.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this beer truly special is the Saison Ale yeast strain used to ferment this beer. The subtle hints of tangerine, peach and licorice are the hallmarks of this particular yeast.\r\n\r\nBooyah is a farmhouse ale, which means it\u2019s a kitchen sink type of recipe, so there are no rules when it comes to grain bill, hops or yeast. When it comes to grain, just name it, barley, oats, wheat, rye and corn. The rye malt and oats produce a really earthy smell in the mash. For this ale we use a specific saison ale strain. This yeast has been cultured to produce a lot of fruity and spicy esters, such as apricot, clove, banana and anise. Keeping the a fermentation temperature at 68 degrees controls the ester of the yeast strain. This yeast strain also likes to take its\u2019 time, a long and slow fermentation settles out the finished beer. This is a good sippin\u2019 beer for me. I enjoy a glass when all the work of the day is done. The complexity of this beer re-energizes me.\r\n\r\nThis is a great seasonal beer that we released in the spring the last two years.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
