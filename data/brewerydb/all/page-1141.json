Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Burton Ale was Burton-upon-Trent\u2019s signature beer before Pale ale and IPA. Originally, in the early 1800s, it was dark, made with brown malt\u2013as pale malt was yet to be widely used\u2013reasonably hopped, and fairly sweet with alcohol ranging from 7-12% abv. Brewers Michael Bass, Samuel Allsopp and William Worthington made good money shipping these beers to Russia and the Baltic but as the English Baltic trades fell apart in the early 1800s, and as trends at home went towards more hop-forward \"pale ales\" and \"IPAs\" made for the East India Company, Burton Ales became paler in color, drier in finish, and more heavily hopped, increasing to as much as 1-2 pounds per barrel of exclusively Fuggles and Goldings hops. As this new version of strong Burton Ale made it to London it was referred to as \"Olde\" or \"Olde Burton\":\r\n\r\nThus, we present to you \"Old Burton Extra:\" A large ale of considerable strength (8.9%abv), hopped with 1 pound per barrel Goldings in the kettle (77 IBUS) and another pound per barrel of Fuggles dry-hop, this ale drinks with huge citrus fruit esters, dark candied fruit, considerable dry bitterness, and faint notes of spicy hop, caramel, and fruitcake.
