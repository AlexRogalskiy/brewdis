The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

Circusplaneet was founded by Frank Dejanckheere, Gadele Dauwe and Emily Ghekiere: \u201cThey dreamed of a better world. A place where kids, youngsters and adults could celebrate their quirky creative zest of life. And all of this in an atmosphere of trust, solidarity and fun.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt the 2010 Network of International Circus Educators Conference in Berlin, Circus Mojo\u2019s Creator, Paul Miller, met Circusplaneet\u2019s Co\u00f6rdinator, Matthias Vermael. An innovator, free thinker and showman, Vermael introduced Miller to BIRCUS, an idea sparked from the desire to eschew government funding in pursuit of circus autonomy. Fancy that! These kindred spirits bonded over a couple BIRCUS beers and planned to bring this big-top idea stateside. Miller licensed the concept and set forth to expand the Ludlow Theatre into a brewery connected to local history, community outreach, unique entertainment and stellar beer.\r\nIn 2015 Miller purchased equipment made in California by New World Brewing Systems in October of 1996, the month and year he proposed to \u201cGourmet\u201d Ren\u00e9e, his wife of 18 years and namesake of the LLC. It was fate: love, circus and beer. The brewing system has a 5 barrel mash tun and brew kettle, three 10 barrel fermenters and three 10 barrel bright tanks. Each tank has a glycol jacket and there is a glycol storage unit in matching stainless.\r\nThe TTB, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, has granted Miller a Federal Brewer\u2019s Notice. BIRCUS has secured a certificate of occupancy from PDS\/the City of Ludlow and microbrewery permits from the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the City of Ludlow.  BIRCUS is distributed in Northern Kentucky by Chas. Seligman. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBIRCUS, where the surreal world of circus meets the simple love of beer, will deliver a jaw-dropping, thirst-defying brewery experience. Our performers will juggle clubs, breathe fire, hula hoop, walk on kegs and amaze on the trapeze and aerial silks at the Ludlow Theatre and area venues serving our brew. Raise a glass, see a circus and toast to all.","website":"http:\/\/www.bircus.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I4vp71\/upload_vwaPtL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I4vp71\/upload_vwaPtL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I4vp71\/upload_vwaPtL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I4vp71\/upload_vwaPtL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/I4vp71\/upload_vwaPtL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-08 13:54:49","updateDate":"2018-11-09 00:11:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"C2ER6Y1VPT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"epF2KJ","name":"Bircus","streetAddress":"322 Elm St","locality":"Ludlow","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41016","phone":"8593607757","website":"www.bircus.com","latitude":39.0934787,"longitude":-84.5493443,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-01-08 15:01:11","updateDate":"2018-04-10 13:11:38","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"44zKy1","name":"ATL Brewnited","nameDisplay":"ATL Brewnited","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-06-08 15:44:47","updateDate":"2018-06-11 14:27:24","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers.

Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness. We are active in the community through volunteer work and partnerships with local charities.","website":"http:\/\/www.pinestreetbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:55:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"6LORC8NJKE","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"EhUsAz","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94108","phone":"415-744-4062","latitude":37.79179,"longitude":-122.407419,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xL7Zyb","name":"Atomic #29","nameDisplay":"Atomic #29","description":"A hop forward ale made with seven malts to produce a nice copper color.","abv":"8","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xL7Zyb\/upload_DYZ30i-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xL7Zyb\/upload_DYZ30i-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xL7Zyb\/upload_DYZ30i-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xL7Zyb\/upload_DYZ30i-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xL7Zyb\/upload_DYZ30i-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/xL7Zyb\/upload_DYZ30i-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-17 18:14:16","updateDate":"2019-02-22 18:01:48","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

A minimum 51% of the fermentable carbohydrates must be derived from malted grains. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used and creativity should be considered. Beers such as garden (vegetable), fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:02"},"breweries":[{"id":"11gqIZ","name":"Atlanta Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Atlanta","description":"Atlanta Brewing Co is dedicated to brewing innovative beers, focusing on quality, and utilizing regional ingredients whenever possible.
