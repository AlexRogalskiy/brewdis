This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"cJio9R","name":"(512) Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"(512)","description":"(512) Brewing is a micro-brewery located in the heart of Austin, brewing for the community using as many local, domestic and organic ingredients as possible.

Fast friends and freshman roommates, they came up together during their years at UNH.  After graduation each wished the other well and split for separate coasts. Dane crossed the country, landing in San Francisco, where a hobby born from homebrewing with his father compelled him to volunteer at Magnolia Gastropub & Brewery in the Bay Area's famed Haight-Ashbury. It was at Magnolia that Dane first got drunk on beer. Well, wait, not intoxicated drunk, though, obviously one can assume, but drunk as in impassioned. He became impassioned to turn a hobby into a life\u2019s discipline. In the years to follow, Dane would become a brewer at the international brewery Trumer, lead brewer at Magnolia, and in 2015, upon returning to the Seacoast, brewer at Smuttynose.\r\n\r\nDuring that time Dagan spent his days laying roots in Portsmouth. Although, he\u2019s worked in restaurants since fourteen, it was Dane who got him his first gig in the downtown area, bussing tables on the decks. Despite his brief flirtation with advertising, Dagan never fully wrenched himself from behind the bar. What began as bussing, turned to bartending, turned to the acting General Manager at the Franklin Oyster House. And over that time his reverence for the bar has grown as deep as stout.\r\n\r\nNowadays the two are down in the trenches at the official Liars' Bench, sledgehammering concrete and pouring it. Dane is eager to brew, Dagan is eager to pour, and both are eagerly awaiting the not so distant date when the doors open and it all really begins.","website":"http:\/\/www.liarsbenchbeer.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rGEsmP\/upload_biYuMv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-09 16:09:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:43:33","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H6A0BGIYVJ","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"azeG7v","name":"Liar's Bench Beer Co.","streetAddress":"459 Islington Street #4","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","website":"http:\/\/www.liarsbenchbeer.com","latitude":43.0722885,"longitude":-70.7685789,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-09 16:10:42","updateDate":"2016-09-20 15:07:59","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-12:00pm-8:00pm,thu-12:00pm-8:00pm,fri-12:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"huKquc","name":"Young's Winter Warmer","nameDisplay":"Young's Winter Warmer","description":"Winter Warmer is the definitive winter beer and is a long-time Young\u2019s favourite.

Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:57:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZM2TJ0CERB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mBpv9h","name":"Youngers Special Bitter","nameDisplay":"Youngers Special Bitter","description":"Our original Rogue Ale, Youngers Special Bitter (affectionately nicknamed YSB) is a classic English Special Bitter named after Bill Younger of the infamous Horse Brass Pub in Portland, Oregon.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate.

Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

Their brash personalities and drinking proclivities made for an immediate friendship.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation week ended, Brian moved to Louisville to take a job as assistant brewer with Bluegrass Brewing and Joe went back to Massachusetts to become the assistant brewer for Back East Brewing. One year later, after heeding some timely advice from Joe\u2019s wife, Joe and Brian decided to take their dream brewery seriously.  After a few weeks of discussion over its final location, Brian boldly packed a U-Haul truck, moved to Connecticut and accepted a job as the head brewer of a then unopened facility.\r\n\r\nScott Stauffer, an insurance careerist, who once harbored dreams of resurrecting a long dead Pennsylvania brand, hit on a tip from a friend and met Joe and Brian over beers at the Hartford drinking institution The Spigot. Although Brian and Joe did not bring any of their own beer, Scott gleaned two things: that Joe and Brian were nuts for good beer and that they wanted to brew it in Hartford.  Most importantly for a reasonable fellow like Scott, he realized their skeleton of a business plan had some good bones.\r\n\r\nTwo years after that meeting, they\u2019ve thrown themselves into the Hanging Hills Brewing Company project with everything they\u2019ve got.

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-03-14 13:33:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UH4raL","name":"Ypres Pils","nameDisplay":"Ypres Pils","abv":"5.2","styleId":106,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-26 16:08:49","updateDate":"2016-01-26 16:08:49","style":{"id":106,"categoryId":10,"category":{"id":10,"name":"International Styles","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"International-Style Pilsener","shortName":"International Pilsener","description":"International Pilseners are straw\/golden in color and are well attenuated.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
