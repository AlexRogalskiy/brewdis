We focus on pushing American styles and brewing flavorful, unique beers to drink. We like it hoppy and complex to roasty and smokey, strong and sippable to session and gulpable. Most importantly we like it happy and enjoyable. Something to drink with friends, in the backyard, at the beach and at the bar. We make beer because we like to drink and we like to smile.","website":"http:\/\/www.finbackbrewery.com\/","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/finbackbrewery.com\/mailinglist.html","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rlG8sP\/upload_Z2oUdX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:09:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"MQC1VWPABU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"zwemPe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7801 77th Ave.","locality":"Glendale","region":"New York","postalCode":"11385","website":"http:\/\/www.finbackbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.7065426,"longitude":-73.8731778,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-04-20 15:20:51","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"idsF1H","name":"Session IPA","nameDisplay":"Session IPA","description":"- Hoppy - Piney - Floral - (COLOR) light amber (AROMA) earthy hops, light caramel malt, citrus rind (FLAVOR) pine, bread crust, citrus (FOOD PAIRING) grilled burgers, zesty salads, grilled chicken","abv":"4","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-21 21:40:28","updateDate":"2017-06-26 17:49:13","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"nHLlnK","name":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Sierra Nevada","description":"The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company was established in 1980 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi.
