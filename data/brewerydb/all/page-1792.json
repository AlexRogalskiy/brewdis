Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"63","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"7","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:33"},"breweries":[{"id":"owOdTA","name":"Jaws Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jaws","website":"http:\/\/www.jawsbeer.ru","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/owOdTA\/upload_bCdey7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/owOdTA\/upload_bCdey7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/owOdTA\/upload_bCdey7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/owOdTA\/upload_bCdey7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/owOdTA\/upload_bCdey7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-18 06:01:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DkZK2I","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"ul.

Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.

Bread or biscuit-like malt character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Hop aroma and flavor should be notable but at low to medium levels. Fruity esters should not be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"5.3","abvMax":"5.9","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"15","ogMin":"1.05","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:38"},"breweries":[{"id":"X38nDm","name":"Three Notch'd Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Three Notch'd","description":"Three Notch'd Craft Kitchen & Brewery serves up locally sourced, beer-infused, gourmet food options as well as Three Notch'd craft beer, cider, wine, craft sodas brewed in house, and signature cocktails in a family friendly inviting atmosphere.","website":"http:\/\/threenotchdbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X38nDm\/upload_4AmjeW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 11:10:10","updateDate":"2019-01-23 13:37:51","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"LPWA4KBJSO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"9zVaSj","name":"Three Notch'd Sour House","streetAddress":"946 Grady Ave","extendedAddress":"Ste 9","locality":"Charlottesville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22903","phone":"(434) 961-0959","website":"http:\/\/threenotchdbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  4:00pm -

Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.

Courouss\u00e9 by those nasty attitudes of American brewers make 22 different seasons in the same brewery, a bit like an excuse for beers nonsensical to 23% alcohol and very far from the Belgian seasons, I embarked on the adventure . Pale malt, aromatic hops, not always the same. And hop beer once brewed to 5% volume in old barrels St Bon-Chien, full of microorganisms on balance, I'm not 276 before the overflowing barrels.\r\n\r\nI taste just me and the idea of \u200b\u200bcutting the old beer with the same but very fresh and bitter. The 225 season \u221a Was Born. I add \"historical\" season ahead for the U.S. market and I put it in my suitcase whenever I meet friends who hold bars. Amazing and rapid success, it becomes a sort of gateway into the wonderful world of beers acids, balanced, acidic and bitter at once complex and easily refreshing, moving beautifully bottled on wild yeasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeight of destiny, I talk Yvan Brasserie de la Senne, a geek and beer historian who told me that in Belgium at the time were often the old with the new beers, mixed history to get this weird taste acid. \r\nAccordingly finally redefined the historical season (pronounced by pinching the nose) style, I cook up some variations. This time, allow me to use the first person singular, because when I came to work with my idea of St festival Bon-Chien, I promise you that my team took me for a fool. One more time.","abv":"9","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-08 14:51:33","updateDate":"2017-01-10 22:06:04","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
