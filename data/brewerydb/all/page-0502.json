This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","abvMin":"3.75","abvMax":"6.5","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:44"},"beerVariation":{"id":"WHQisc","name":"Dragon's Milk","nameDisplay":"Dragon's Milk","abv":"11","ibu":"31","styleId":43,"isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:06","updateDate":"2017-10-16 13:18:55","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle.

For a beer called \u201cWhite Label\u201d we immediately decided that this would obviously be a \u201cwhite\u201d IPA \u2013 but no spices or orange peels, clean and neutral yeast. The white in this IIPA is from using a combination of wheat and rye which leave a cool protein haze.\r\n\r\nSo OK\u2013 what next?\r\n\r\nWe felt like this was a good opportunity to lean on some of our more tropical and floral hops, so we built the recipe around a variety of new-fangled German and New Zealand hops, as well as Amarillo, a favorite US variety that features dankly citric overtones. These aromatic elements go great with the dark tangerine notes of the Bavaria Mandarina, and the floral tropicality of NZ Motueka. The elements add up to a really neat combination of fruits and flowers and a really nice lot of Maui Wowie (you know what I mean).\r\n\r\nWhite Label. It\u2019s a thing.

Dark but smooth, maly and semi-sweet, with caramel tones and a slight mocha finish. Mahogany body with ruby highlights. So smooth, this beer is constantly turning regular light-beer drinkers to the dark side. Pale, Munich, Chocolate and Caramel malts make up the backbone of this Ale. Challenger and EKG hops are used sparingly.","abv":"7.2","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":7,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yEjCDY\/upload_vnx791-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yEjCDY\/upload_vnx791-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yEjCDY\/upload_vnx791-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yEjCDY\/upload_vnx791-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yEjCDY\/upload_vnx791-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/yEjCDY\/upload_vnx791-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Bacon, Scottish Ale Brew-Bq Sauce Ribs, Jim Beam Sirloin Steak","createDate":"2012-01-10 19:02:08","updateDate":"2015-12-16 14:05:03","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":7,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Light Ale","shortName":"Scottish Light","description":"Scottish light ales are light bodied.

Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"9","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.5","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"17","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:41"},"breweries":[{"id":"77YOgn","name":"Front Street Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Front Street","description":"Located in Historic Downtown, the Front Street Brewery is Wilmington\u2019s only Restaurant with its own Brewery.
