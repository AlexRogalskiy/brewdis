Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"fz3g3i","name":"Pipeworks Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Pipeworks","description":"Pipeworks began, as many breweries do, in the stove top kettles and plastic-bucket fermenters of the home brewer.

While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"L2dAEr","name":"Anderson Valley Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Anderson Valley","description":"We carefully craft our world-class ales using only the finest ingredients; premium malted and roasted grains, hops, yeast, and pristine Boonville water straight from our own unique aquifer, and we never heat pasteurize or sterile filter our beers.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:04"},"breweries":[{"id":"lIFabM","name":"Oliphant Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Oliphant","description":"we're pretty sure that the beer made was part ectoplasmic mud intended as a 5th dimensional chrysalis for an almost immediate and rude awakening of shrimp-kind. once fed to the prawny bastards they grow strong and stout. they're tenuous ligament connections calcify and grow stronger and they can appear to read people's minds by a simple flexing of their delicious muscles. they're tv antenna antennas probe the air and gently wave in the breeze though the touch them is as touching rough-grit sand and glass paper and leaves tiny shards similar grabbing the white paint of a fire hydrant marker. \r\n\r\nwe had no idea. we swear. \r\n\r\nwe're just here's to brew beer, not help with the awakening of the earth's 6th cycle of developed beings. that being said -- all hail the prawn people! may their mighty and lesser claws be bound only by their own strength of will. let the buddha shrimp click and clackle their obscene language to the world.","website":"http:\/\/www.oliphantbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lIFabM\/upload_wpcVU8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lIFabM\/upload_wpcVU8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lIFabM\/upload_wpcVU8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lIFabM\/upload_wpcVU8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/lIFabM\/upload_wpcVU8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-30 12:35:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:23:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M6U7IYCHZK","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"kn04yJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"350 Main St.","extendedAddress":"Ste 2","locality":"Somerset","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54025","latitude":45.122818,"longitude":-92.678506,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-30 12:37:57","updateDate":"2015-03-30 12:37:57","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"4:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-4:00pm-9:00pm,fri-4:00pm-9:00pm,sat-12:00pm-9:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
