The microbrewery is located in a 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) factory in in Red Hook, Brooklyn that formerly manufactured filing cabinets. Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.  Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.","website":"http:\/\/www.sixpoint.com\/","established":"2004","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/sixpoint.com\/connect","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:07:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"G3LAVWB289","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"QJRQhZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"40 Van Dyke St","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11231","website":"http:\/\/www.sixpoint.com\/","latitude":40.6739685,"longitude":-74.0119553,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2005","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-08-19 18:36:16","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9J01ev","name":"Admiral's Ale","nameDisplay":"Admiral's Ale","abv":"5","styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9J01ev\/upload_jdNZWd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9J01ev\/upload_jdNZWd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9J01ev\/upload_jdNZWd-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9J01ev\/upload_jdNZWd-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9J01ev\/upload_jdNZWd-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9J01ev\/upload_jdNZWd-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 21:09:32","updateDate":"2015-12-17 21:46:30","style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.
