It has an ABV of 10.2% and uses the Westmalle yeast strain but all other details are speculation and the recipe is tightly guarded. The date stamped on the cap is a \"Best After\" date approximately three year after the day of production. The yellow cap is the only identifying mark of this beer as there is no label and they use three different bottles in production: plain, \"Trappisten,\" and \"Westmalle.\" The beer is not distributed anywhere in the world. The only way to acquire it is to visit the monastery.\r\n\r\nYoung bottles tend to be rather boozy, yet, the alcohol is never hot or harsh. Dried, dark fruit esters come through in the nose and taste and are accompanied by intense melanoidins. The characterful Westmalle yeast contributes to a doughy aroma, low bubble gum esters (think Juicy Fruit) and a hint of black licorice.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"NqzbCm","name":"Imperial Western Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Imperial Western","description":"From the brewery: \"Named after the legendary Southern Pacific train of the 1930\u2019s, Imperial Western Brewing Co marks a new era of imbibing and dining for commuters at Union Station.

The variety of ways they can be used in brewing and the range of flavors and aromas that they bring to beer are vast and areas in which we enjoy experimenting heavily. No surprise then that the word \"hop\" appears in our name and that the majority of our recipes begin with a specific variety or intuitive blend of hops in mind.\r\n\r\nHow we are inspired by the \"Butcher\" portion of our namesake is thankfully less bloody than the history behind it, but there are a lot of butcher-esque traits that we do draw inspiration from. All of the ones we grew up around were approachable, dependable and visibly and vocally passionate about their craft. They'd take the time to get to know you, get technical when necessary and if you wanted it, help you find something or make a recommendation. That's who we aim to be, except with hops, yeast, water and grain in a brewery instead of a butcher shop and a meat-filled counter.\r\n\r\nFinally, at some point, you'll refer to us simply as \"Hop Butcher\" (and we're cool with that), but the \"For The World\" part is an important and meaningful element of our name. It inspires the ingredients we use and the personality behind the beers we brew: unique enough for the beer geeks, approachable enough for the newcomers. It guides who we work with and where our cans and kegs are distributed...and where they might someday be distributed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHop Butcher For The World","website":"http:\/\/www.hopbutcher.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/YVmM3c\/upload_9Gsd9s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-12 16:22:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:50:15","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6BOINF90Y","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"mDFzjD","name":"Hop Butcher For The World","streetAddress":"1000 N.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

We strive to bring an authentic and pleasant experience to all of our customers through our unique ales and lagers.","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","established":"1985","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/noGtDY\/upload_wkGjOC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:07:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ORN90Y51W8","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"NnffJ2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8938 Krum Ave.","locality":"Galesburg","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49053","phone":"269-382-2338","website":"http:\/\/www.bellsbeer.com\/","latitude":42.2843486,"longitude":-85.4538497,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1985","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-25 20:15:04","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"uCUre7","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E Kalamazoo Ave","locality":"Kalamazoo","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49007","website":"http:\/\/bellsbeer.com\/eccentric-cafe\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","latitude":42.2949613,"longitude":-85.5789817,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-26 11:44:59","updateDate":"2015-05-06 15:19:37","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\r\nThu:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\n\r\nOur kitchen closes daily at 9 p.m.","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Y0IatW","name":"Bell's Eccentric Cafe","streetAddress":"355 E.

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute flavor and\/or aroma. Perceived fruit qualities should be authentic and replicate true fruit complexity as much as possible. Color should reflect a degree of fruit's color. Hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor from yeast can be typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clovelike characteristics should not be perceived. Body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Brewer may indicate on the bottle whether the yeast should be intentionally roused or if they prefer that the entry be poured as quietly as possible.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:43:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"boTIWO","name":"Atwater Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Atwater","description":"Atwater Block Brewery, founded in 1997, is housed in a 1916 factory warehouse located in Detroit's historic Rivertown district.
