Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau.

Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:21"},"breweries":[{"id":"X7fpqb","name":"Feldschl\u00f6sschen Getr\u00e4nke AG","nameShortDisplay":"Feldschl\u00f6sschen","website":"http:\/\/www.feldschloesschen.ch","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X7fpqb\/upload_ZIXt72-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X7fpqb\/upload_ZIXt72-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X7fpqb\/upload_ZIXt72-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X7fpqb\/upload_ZIXt72-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/X7fpqb\/upload_ZIXt72-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FxyfOU","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Theophil-Roniger-Strasse","locality":"Rheinfelden","postalCode":"4310","phone":"41 848 125 000","website":"http:\/\/www.feldschloesschen.ch\/","latitude":47.5462648,"longitude":7.7919816,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CH","yearOpened":"1876","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 12:43:58","updateDate":"2018-05-02 20:41:53","country":{"isoCode":"CH","name":"SWITZERLAND","displayName":"Switzerland","isoThree":"CHE","numberCode":756,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FPHVk1","name":"Cardinal Draft Original","nameDisplay":"Cardinal Draft Original","description":"Since 1995, the Cardinal Draft has no equal for a refreshment during the sweet summer evenings.
