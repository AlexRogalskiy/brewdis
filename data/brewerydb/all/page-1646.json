From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:38:53","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"EHRB4SUDWI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

He started home brewing in 1994 after a year abroad studying Linguistics at The Braunschweig Technical University in Germany.  He actually caught the bug 5 years earlier on one of his high school exchange trips to Clauthal-Zellerfeld in Germany.  While on an excursion with the group to London, the father of the family he was staying with served him his homebrewed John Bull.  He would never forget it, but would wait to brew his own until the legal age of 21.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from the University of Oklahoma with degrees in International Business, German and Management Information Systems, he started a 16 year career in the Information Technology business that was very successful.  Many lasting relationships were formed during this time.  Many of his biggest supporters come from this IT family as well as his extended Soccer family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000 he and his wife moved to Tulsa into a home in the Renaissance neighborhood.  They quickly fell in love with its charm, character, neighbors, surrounding shops, accessibility and walkability.  He served as the neighborhood president for 4 years from 2006 through 2010 and ever since as Treasurer on the board.  There are so many things that they liked about living in this part of Midtown Tulsa that when they had kids they renovated their house versus moving to another part of town.\r\n\r\nGlenn continued to dream of becoming a professional brewer someday and was always looking to further his education in the brewing field.  In 2008 while taking a tour of a brewery in Hood River, Oregon he decided to start taking the necessary steps to make this dream a reality.  He began to read anything and everything beer related and of course brewed and brewed.  In October of 2011 the Hall\u2019s founded the Renaissance Brewing Company and purchased a dilapidated commercial property in their neighborhood at 12th and Lewis where they wanted to build the brewery building.  Tulsa\u2019s antiquated zoning laws, however, only allowed breweries in Industrial areas so they had to apply for a zoning variance.  Although this was a delay of over a year, Glenn never lost track of his vision.\r\n\r\nHe completed the Concise Course in Brewing Technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago, Ill. as well as the esteemed International Diploma Program from the World Brewing Academy which is a partnership between the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago and the Doemens Institute in Munich, Germany.  Glenn also successfully completed the Colorado Boy Brewery and Pub Immersion Course with the famous Tom Hennessy in Ridgway Colorado.

Our success is derived from hard work, unbridled passion and the support from customers who appreciate these qualities and a well made beer.\r\n\r\nWhile we take great care in making the best beer possible, we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We go out of our way to take any pretense out of our beer. We believe in rustic, natural quality over fancy-pants snobbery. Our marketing and branding efforts try to reinforce this and we choose to market by talking to folks instead of blaring messages through mass-market advertising.","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"Y","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:33:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lvNMRa","name":"Beaus Brewery","streetAddress":"10 Terry Fox Drive","locality":"Vankleek Hill","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"K0B 1R0","phone":"(866) 585 BEER","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","hoursOfOperation":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","latitude":45.5177348,"longitude":-74.6374259,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:36:23","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NgvN4U","name":"Trick or Treat","nameDisplay":"Trick or Treat","description":"Our Chocolate Pumpkin Porter melds together rich chocolate decadence with fall spices.
