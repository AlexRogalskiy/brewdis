Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Masses of dry hops are piled after fermentation to spike a wild blend of tropical, spicy aromas.","abv":"6.2","ibu":"65","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Jra85l\/upload_f6uKCT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Jra85l\/upload_f6uKCT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Jra85l\/upload_f6uKCT-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Jra85l\/upload_f6uKCT-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Jra85l\/upload_f6uKCT-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Jra85l\/upload_f6uKCT-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 18:41:35","updateDate":"2018-01-11 20:50:57","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

As usual, he took this move with seriousness and intensity . . . while having a blast!\r\n\r\nAfter researching the art of brewing, he discovered that contrary to the perceived image of brewers, the occupation required a variety of skills beyond drinking a lot. So, Jem decided to get a hospitality and management degree from F.I.U. in Florida and at the same time practiced and fine-tuned his brewing (and drinking) skills in his makeshift home brewery.\r\n\r\nThe next stop was a surprise- U.C. Davis in California to study Microbiology and The Advanced Sciences of Brewing. \u201cTo make perfect beer you need to understand the science of beer\u201d, he would convince himself during mind-numbing chemistry and advanced sanitation classes.\r\n\r\nTo further quench his thirst for brewing knowledge and skills, Jem upped the ante and applied to Chicago\u2019s Siebel Institute of Technology, the Mecca for beer industry education and way station for some of the world\u2019s renowned brew masters. However, to his amazement, he was rejected.\r\n\r\nRejection didn\u2019t stand in his way. Jem clenched his teeth and pushed forward understanding that to be accepted to the revered institute he would need some serious brewing experience. The next stop was as an assistant brewer at Oxford Brewing Company of Maryland. A year and a half and many bags of grain later, Jem was accepted to Siebel where he completed his academic studies, hung out with Budweiser and Coors Jr., and gained 10 kilos.\r\n\r\nArmed with a battery of diplomas and experience, Jem continued to execute his plan with determination. He immigrated to Israel with his wife, two kids, five thousand dollars, and a dream of producing premium fresh beer in the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nHere Dan came into the picture. Dan, a lawyer and entrepreneur originally from New York, heard about this strange pioneer with an overwhelming passion for beer and people, and was intrigued. The two met for a beer, the hops sparked and the deal was struck- Jem and Dan would establish a factory for fresh beer in Israel.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe it wasn\u2019t that easy. The journey was long and arduous, full of bureaucracy, business plans, searching for locations in dubious industrial zones, and mainly naysayers and skeptics who couldn\u2019t understand what these two Americans were trying to do.\r\n\r\nFinally, after extensive wanderings, they found an old factory in a dusty corner of Petach Tikva\u2019s industrial zone. Where others would have turned their backs, the two saw the potential and decided that the dream will turn to reality at number 15 Hamagshimim Street.","website":"http:\/\/www.jems.co.il\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-12 23:46:14","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Onv9LT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Hamagshimim Street","locality":"Petah Tiqwa","region":"Hamerkaz","phone":"+972 3-919-5367","latitude":32.1800086,"longitude":34.8922451,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-28 15:00:35","updateDate":"2016-06-28 15:00:50","timezoneId":"Asia\/Jerusalem","country":{"isoCode":"IL","name":"ISRAEL","displayName":"Israel","isoThree":"ISR","numberCode":376,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
