A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

When Giovanni consulted the astrologist about about he and his sons destinies, displeasure was an understatement.  Luca was subjected to the torture (which he survived) and exiled from Bologna.\r\nTight cords were wound around the limbs (usually arms) while the condemned was belted\/secured to a stationary structure.
