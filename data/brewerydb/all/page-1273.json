Alaskan brewers have put a new spin on the Pumpkin Porter that has come out the past two years, and produced a smooth brown ale-based recipe that combines holiday spices and organicPumpkin Ale_Product Shot-pressrelease pumpkin for a perfect autumn pour.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Juneau,we\u2019re acutely aware of the transition from Summer to Fall, and we like to make the absolute best of the season by bringing as much flavor as possible to our Fall Seasonal beer,\u201d said Brent Kesey, one of the lead brewers on this beer. \u201cSo, even though the days are getting a little shorter, we have something to be happy about! We think folks are going to really like the holiday flavor and drinkability of this new beer.\u201d\r\n\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of the highly regarded Alaskan Pumpkin Porter, this Pumpkin Ale has the holiday spices of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and brown sugar plus a pinch of Alaskan\u2019s famous alder-smoked malt, with a base of a lighter brown ale featuring Vienna malt and Goldings hops.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were going for a warming spicy brew with a rich welcoming flavor that reminds me of the great flavors and aromas of pumpkin pie,\u201d said Kesey. \u201cUp here in Alaska we fight the cold and dark by getting together with family and friends. This time of year is when the strong community we have here is so important, and this beer is perfect for keeping those great get-togethers going strong.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis very quaffable Fall Seasonal beer will be perfect with any holiday fare or sweeter breads, but can also work well with salted meats or pretzels to let that spicy sweetness compliment the savory saltiness. Alaskan Pumpkin Ale will be available in most markets by mid-August, as Alaskan Summer Ale begins to leave the shelves, and will run until November when Winter Ale ships out.","abv":"6","styleId":121,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XPGMXL\/upload_XYGcNq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XPGMXL\/upload_XYGcNq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XPGMXL\/upload_XYGcNq-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XPGMXL\/upload_XYGcNq-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XPGMXL\/upload_XYGcNq-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/XPGMXL\/upload_XYGcNq-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-01 02:50:26","updateDate":"2015-12-18 04:39:24","style":{"id":121,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pumpkin Beer","shortName":"Pumpkin Beer","description":"Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.
