A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"7kCNmJ","name":"Jester King Craft Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Jester King Craft","description":"Located in the beautiful Texas Hill Country, Jester King Craft Brewery is an authentic farmhouse brewery committed to brewing artisan ales of great depth and character.

Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

It isn\u2019t filtered, isn\u2019t pasteurised and is naturally carbonated so there is minimum interference with it between raw ingredients and finished product. We always start with the best quality ingredients including; Maris Otter malt, full leaf hop cones and the limestone rich water of West Waterford.\r\nOur brewer strives for quality and consistency across every stage of the brew, working hard to ensure that each bottle achieves the high standards he has set. All the beers are craft brewed in small batches and by its artisan nature this can lead to slight variations by batch.\r\nThe brewhouse is a 6bbl plant made by PBC Brewery Installations, the UK\u2019s top micro brewery installer and is ideally suited to the bottle-conditioned traditional ales that we brew.\r\nBottling is currently done by hand with a four-head filler with plans to upgrade this to an automated system in the coming months.","website":"http:\/\/dungarvanbrewingcompany.com","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-16 01:08:24","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"aps8aW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unit 5 No. 2","extendedAddress":"Westgate Business Park","region":"Waterford","phone":"+353 58 24000","website":"http:\/\/www.dungarvanbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":52.0955413,"longitude":-7.633504,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-16 13:00:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KclqIz","name":"Comes & Gose","nameDisplay":"Comes & Gose","description":"A blend of 70% acidic fermented lees; 30% fruity Brett fermented cider.
