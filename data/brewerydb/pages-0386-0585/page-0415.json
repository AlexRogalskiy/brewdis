I thought, \u201cOh great, there\u2019s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month\u2019s time.\u201d  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we\u2019re married, I couldn\u2019t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!  Adam\u2019s hobby turned into full-blown obsession, and in tribute to the little man who started it all, Reuben\u2019s Brews was born!","website":"http:\/\/www.reubensbrews.com","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.reubensbrews.com\/contact\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n2527g\/upload_sbYn2b-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n2527g\/upload_sbYn2b-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n2527g\/upload_sbYn2b-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n2527g\/upload_sbYn2b-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/n2527g\/upload_sbYn2b-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-09-19 14:25:26","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"QEUPIOAK9G","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"6mYnLr","name":"Pilot Brewery","streetAddress":"1406 NW 53rd Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 1A","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","website":"http:\/\/www.reubensbrews.com","latitude":47.6674065,"longitude":-122.3740714,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-09-19 14:24:26","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"22eMcl","name":"Reuben's Brews - The Taproom","streetAddress":"5010 14th Avenue Northwest","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","latitude":47.6653979,"longitude":-122.3730986,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-09-19 00:04:22","updateDate":"2019-09-19 14:24:36","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-10:00pm,tue-11:00am-10:00pm,wed-11:00am-10:00pm,thu-11:00am-10:00pm,fri-11:00am-10:00pm,sat-11:00am-10:00pm,sun-11:00am-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"eMNAmC","name":"Reuben's Brews - The Brewtap","streetAddress":"800 Northwest 46th Street","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","latitude":47.6624063,"longitude":-122.3666378,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2018","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-09-19 00:05:40","updateDate":"2019-09-19 14:24:32","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-12:00pm-10:00pm,sun-12:00pm-10:00pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cb55J8","name":"Cream Ale","nameDisplay":"Cream Ale","description":"A Classic American Ale brewed with corn and American 2 row malt.
