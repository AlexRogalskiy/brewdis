For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

We call it 'Real Live Beer' and encourage you to keep it well refrigerated to maintain quality and freshness.","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","mailingListUrl":"info@sprigandfern.co.nz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"VWuTZv","name":"Tinakori Road Sprig & Fern Tavern","streetAddress":"342 Tinakori Rd","locality":"Thorndon","region":"Wellington","postalCode":"6011","phone":"04 499 1390","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandferntaverns.co.nz\/taverns\/tinakori-road-wellington","latitude":-41.2788229,"longitude":174.7691029,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:20","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:01:49","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7QJgg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"53 Beach Road","locality":"Richmond","region":"Nelson","postalCode":"7020","phone":"03 544 8675","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","latitude":-41.3337821,"longitude":173.1860035,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-27 18:04:29","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:06:29","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"tue":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"4:30pm"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"4:30pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"4:30pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"6:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"tue-12:00pm-4:30pm,wed-12:00pm-4:30pm,thu-12:00pm-4:30pm,fri-12:00pm-6:00pm,sat-12:00pm-6:00pm","timezoneId":"Pacific\/Auckland","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bljgmj","name":"Dopplebock","nameDisplay":"Dopplebock","abv":"5.5","styleId":90,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-05-16 15:14:45","updateDate":"2018-05-16 15:14:45","style":{"id":90,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Doppelbock","shortName":"Doppelbock","description":"Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

Now, Meghann, Smitty, Patrick and Meghann's husband Kevin Quinn are crafting brews that celebrate the world-class hops grown in their backyard. \r\n\r\nWith a 30-barrel brewhouse at a 27,000 square foot facility, Bale Breaker crafts four year-round canned beers, including the widely celebrated Topcutter IPA, and a diverse offering of seasonal beers on draft. The onsite taproom hosts frequent food trucks and events, with a beautiful outdoor patio and lawn, perfect for enjoying the Yakima sunshine here in Washington state.","website":"http:\/\/www.balebreaker.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/guXrwH\/upload_jvJ7Ai-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/guXrwH\/upload_jvJ7Ai-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/guXrwH\/upload_jvJ7Ai-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/guXrwH\/upload_jvJ7Ai-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/guXrwH\/upload_jvJ7Ai-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-30 14:34:45","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:58:36","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"SLK3ZUVIY1","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"n7ntmy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1801 Birchfield Road","locality":"Yakima","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98901","website":"http:\/\/www.balebreaker.com\/","latitude":46.576781,"longitude":-120.435485,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-30 14:37:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
