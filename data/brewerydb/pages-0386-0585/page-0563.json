Despite the ridiculous hop rates (kids, don\u2019t try this at home), this absurdly hopped Double IPA manages to find balance, thanks to the soft, creamy mouthfeel and smooth finish contributed by the white wheat malt, flaked oats, and flaked wheat. With notes of tangerine, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, peach, and grapefruit, Extra Extra Juicy Bits is bursting with so much fruit juice character that it makes you question whether or not actual fruit was added (we assure you, no fruit was added). But there is just enough bitterness to keep the beer grounded and remind you that it\u2019s still a Double IPA.","abv":"8.4","styleId":173,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/opblrO\/upload_jfTnUr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/opblrO\/upload_jfTnUr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/opblrO\/upload_jfTnUr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-12 14:07:46","updateDate":"2018-09-12 18:24:35","style":{"id":173,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Juicy or Hazy Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Juicy or Hazy Double IPA","description":"Color: Straw to deep gold\r\n\r\nClarity: Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers.

Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"L2dAEr","name":"Anderson Valley Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Anderson Valley","description":"We carefully craft our world-class ales using only the finest ingredients; premium malted and roasted grains, hops, yeast, and pristine Boonville water straight from our own unique aquifer, and we never heat pasteurize or sterile filter our beers.

After their children left home, Barry and his wife Chris decided it was a good time to start a new hobby \u2013 brewing beer. After a couple of years of testing, (much) tasting, experimenting with doing our own malting and researching the industry, we decided it was time to take the next step and open a brewery.\r\n\r\nThe name 2 Basset Brewery was born out of the many similarities between basset hounds and our love of a good beer. Bassets are friendly, easy going, very social and they love to relax. Most of all, they make us laugh. These are some of the very same reasons many of us gather with family and friends over a great tasting craft beer.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be crafting brews featuring locally grown grains, malting them ourselves and utilizing other Montana ingredients.

A World Beer Cup winner and beer enthusiast all-time favorite, this traditional English-style ale is made with 2-row pale and English crystal malt which is balanced by copious amounts of English hops. Our version of the full-bodied ale uses both Kent Goldings and Fuggles to impart a rich hop taste. So crack open a fresh jug of ESB, slice off a tasty piece of Gouda, sit back and enjoy this unapologetic, mouth-puckering, bitter, handcrafted ale.","abv":"5","ibu":"35","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5x1ifd\/upload_kcpy49-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5x1ifd\/upload_kcpy49-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5x1ifd\/upload_kcpy49-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5x1ifd\/upload_kcpy49-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5x1ifd\/upload_kcpy49-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/5x1ifd\/upload_kcpy49-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.056","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:11","updateDate":"2015-12-18 15:06:16","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.
