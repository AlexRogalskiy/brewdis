Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia.

We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research\/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries.

In Bavaria this beer would be called a Kristall-Weizen (Crystal-Wheat) because of its clarity. Dancing Trout Ale is brewed with malted wheat, pale and carmel malt, and moderately hopped using the best quality hops from Germany. Unlike its British and American counterparts, Dancing Trout Ale is brewed in the Bavarian tradition: aged a minimum of 28 days, versus 7-10 days for the average ale. This means Dancing Trout Ale is mild with no bitter aftertaste! We dedicate this beer to helping preserve Montana\u2019s trout habitat, one beer at a time. \r\n\r\n To truly appreciate Dancing Trout Ale as a year-round member of Bayern Brewing\u2019s line of fine beers, an explanation is in order. This is especially because it is possible that you may already know this beer by one or two different names. \r\n\r\n Back in 1987, this beer was known as Bayern Light Wheat Ale \u2014 the filtered version of our original Hefeweizen. In 2002, Light Wheat Ale took on the personality many beer connoisseurs came to know as Trout Slayer Ale. The beer and the name grew in popularity, especially with our outdoor and angling audience. Bayern Brewing celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2007, making it the oldest brewery operating in Montana. At that time, in order to honor our time-tested brew, we decided to change the name and the label image to best reflect Bayern Brewing's environmental company philosophy. In our search for a more appropriate name we kept coming back to Dancing Trout and Montana native artist Monte Dolack created yet another evocative image that was used for the label. Whether as a fishing term or in various spiritual expressions of music and dance, Dancing Trout has become a symbol celebrating the lifestyle embraced by Montana and the values of Bayern Brewing.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"18","availableId":7,"styleId":50,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:03","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:19:51","available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."},"style":{"id":50,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Leichtes Weizen \/ Weissbier","shortName":"Leichtesweizen","description":"The German word leicht means light, and as such these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"LFkVMc","name":"Brewery Vivant","nameShortDisplay":"Brewery Vivant","description":"Brewery Vivant is the realization of years of dreaming and much discussion of what a great brewery can be.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"tH0flY","name":"Enegren Brewing Co","nameShortDisplay":"Enegren","website":"http:\/\/www.enegrenbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tH0flY\/upload_BYHbAU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tH0flY\/upload_BYHbAU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tH0flY\/upload_BYHbAU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tH0flY\/upload_BYHbAU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/tH0flY\/upload_BYHbAU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:45:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"V5D8NO09WU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"zT4sZm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"444 Zachary St.","extendedAddress":"Unit 120","locality":"Moorpark","region":"California","postalCode":"93021","phone":"805-552-0602","website":"http:\/\/www.enegrenbrewing.com\/","latitude":34.2831073,"longitude":-118.8709611,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:47:55","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
