From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty.

Something with substance, where the craft of coffee brewing and the craft of beer brewing were perfectly matched into one delicious drink. After some research, we sought out and established a partnership with The Brown Coffee Company, in San Antonio, Texas.\r\n\r\nWe quickly learned from Founder and \u201cCoffee Hunter\u201d Aaron Blanco that Brown is not just special, it is unique in its market. You see, Aaron sources his coffee beans for his craft roasting by establishing direct relationships with coffee farmers around the world. He travels to farms and stays with farmers, and regularly hosts them in San Antonio. He seeks out the best of the best coffees, understanding the unique environment and character of each coffee variety where it is grown, as well as which processing methods best suit which coffees, all in pursuit of the perfect cup.\r\n\r\nWhile Brown works diligently to be as transparent and \u201cinvisible\u201d as possible in selecting, roasting and serving their coffees, when it comes to our El Despierto Coffee Porter, it is anything but invisible. The coffee in El Despierto comes from the Madan Estate in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is a huge coffee with a deep, spicy, tobacco leaf sweetness that converges perfectly with our beer to create something special. Unique. El Despierto is an amazing beer with amazing ingredients that we are sure you will love.","abv":"6.2","ibu":"34","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9kt210\/upload_1SQ4Kj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9kt210\/upload_1SQ4Kj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9kt210\/upload_1SQ4Kj-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9kt210\/upload_1SQ4Kj-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9kt210\/upload_1SQ4Kj-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/9kt210\/upload_1SQ4Kj-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-14 13:58:34","updateDate":"2016-04-14 14:00:52","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
