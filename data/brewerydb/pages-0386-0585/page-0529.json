This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"t9cCJ5","name":"The Commons Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"The Commons","description":"The Commons Brewery is a small craft brewery located in Southeast Portland, Oregon.","website":"http:\/\/www.commonsbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/t9cCJ5\/upload_hlNrgu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2019-02-27 21:38:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"jqK43H","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"630 SE Belmont St.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","phone":"503-819-0758","website":"http:\/\/www.commonsbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Th & Fri: 5-9-ish \r\nSaturday 2-9-ish \r\nSunday 2-6","latitude":45.51631,"longitude":-122.6590488,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2019-02-27 21:38:28","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Th & Fri: 5-9-ish \r\nSaturday 2-9-ish \r\nSunday 2-6","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uYMtk1","name":"Eiffel Good","nameDisplay":"Eiffel Good","description":"Yeast sets this Belgian Farmhouse style ale apart from our other beers, bringing sour and spice to the palate.

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"nEUKxg","name":"Flatlander's Restaurant & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Flatlander's Restaurant","website":"http:\/\/www.flatlanders.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nEUKxg\/upload_VzPfop-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nEUKxg\/upload_VzPfop-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nEUKxg\/upload_VzPfop-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nEUKxg\/upload_VzPfop-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nEUKxg\/upload_VzPfop-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"obAmbB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 Village Green","locality":"Lincolnshire","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60069","phone":"847-821-1234","website":"http:\/\/www.flatlanders.com\/","latitude":42.2026696,"longitude":-87.9308952,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1cfDau","name":"Eighty Shilling Export Ale","nameDisplay":"Eighty Shilling Export Ale","styleId":9,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:09","updateDate":"2015-06-05 19:40:09","style":{"id":9,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Export Ale","shortName":"Scottish Export","description":"The overriding character of Scottish export ale is sweet, caramel-like, and malty.

Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style export ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style export ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style export ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"15","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"10","srmMax":"19","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"kiEmoR","name":"Maclay and Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Maclay and Co.","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kiEmoR\/upload_up9kvV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kiEmoR\/upload_up9kvV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kiEmoR\/upload_up9kvV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kiEmoR\/upload_up9kvV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kiEmoR\/upload_up9kvV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"gPm93w","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Clackmannan","region":"Scotland","latitude":56.107489,"longitude":-3.751156,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MzmujN","name":"Eighty-Four","nameDisplay":"Eighty-Four","abv":"8.4","styleId":33,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-19 21:32:38","updateDate":"2012-12-19 21:32:38","style":{"id":33,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial Red Ale","shortName":"Imperial Red","description":"Imperial Red Ales are deep amber to dark copper\/reddish brown.
