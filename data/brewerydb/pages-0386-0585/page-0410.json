It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"OLmblj","name":"Lift Bridge Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Lift Bridge","description":"Welcome to Lift Bridge Beer Company.

Having already gained significant brewing experience at other Michigan breweries, Joe realized that his style of brewing was best suited to his own business model where he would not have to answer to anyone for putting lots (and lots) of the best possible ingredients into his brews, or for brewing specialty beers that some might consider outrageous. Joe wanted to brew bold, flavorful and extremely creative beer, and felt that people would travel out of the way to get them.\r\nRenovation of the 120-year-old hardware store began in January 2003 when Joe and several friends and volunteers began renovating and restoring the building to what it is today. All the craftsmanship was done by Joe, friends and volunteers, from the trim mold to the bar, right down to the mosaic tile Short\u2019s logo near the pub entrance. The logo mosaic took four people three straight days to complete. The brewing equipment was purchased used. The original seven barrel pub brewing system came with five fermenters and five serving tanks. Many roadblocks and challenges threatened to cancel the project. However, with hard work, determination and many good people lending a hand, the project was finally completed after 18 months. The pub opened its doors on April 26, 2004.\r\nOf building the pub, Joe said: \u201cWords cannot describe the heartache, stress, losses, physical and mental fatigue, and great rewards experienced throughout the struggle to bring the Short\u2019s Brewing Company project to fruition. It is real, and remains real, because we believe in what we do and always have. Short\u2019s is and has been supported by the immediate community and the brewing industry. Short\u2019s Brewing Company is gaining popularity and is highly regarded among the brewing industry for its innovative brewing and tenacity to beat all odds that oppose its inevitable success.\u201d\r\nThough the business got off to a slow start, things began to turn around when Joe\u2019s girlfriend (now wife) Leah joined the team in 2005. Leah managed the deli and took responsibility for the creation of our delicious food menu. This gave Joe more time to concentrate on the brewery and business side of things. Soon after, Scott Newman-Bale, a.k.a. the Magician joined the team, and with his help projects, such as the 2007 Imperial Beer Series, were financed and the brewery finally became a profitable business.\r\nShort\u2019s purchased an old manufacturing building in Elk Rapids in January of 2008. After a year of intense research, fundraising and sweat equity, we were able to design, construct and assemble everything to brew our first Elk Rapids batch of beer in January 2009. When the first production batch shipped in March of 2009, every bottle on the truck was labeled by hand. We have since continued to fund our growth based on our past sales to continue to meet the demand for our beer.\r\nThe only thing that stays the same at Short\u2019s is change! In 2014 we opened our very own \u201cBrewtique,\u201d Short\u2019s Mart and launched Starcut Ciders. Born out of a desire to make unique and traditional ciders from the orchards that surround us in Northern Michigan, Starcut now boasts a portfolio of flagship, seasonal, and pub-only ciders. 2016 continued to bring change as our distribution footprint expanded to include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Colorado (cider only). Pub renovations included the addition of new indoor and outdoor seating, a new kitchen, and a third bar. \r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues its efforts to make the best beer on earth in Northern Michigan. Although we have quickly grown to be one of Michigan\u2019s largest breweries, we still take pride in our hands-on, mom-and-pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We still brew our beer the same way we always have and we always will.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:41:39","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RV6K0I5F9U","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"1-231-498-2300","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2018-02-27 16:24:02","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"G1EkEO","name":"Cozy Cabin Cider","nameDisplay":"Cozy Cabin Cider","description":"Slow brewed, then blended with tart cranberry, clove, and orange peel, Cozy Cabin cider is a sweet apple winter warmer to help you ride out that blizzard.

She is an artist, entrepreneur, a super fit grandmother, and is the glue holding our family together.   \r\n\r\nWhen I returned from a sabbatical to Southeast Asia in 2014 after a career as an engineer, I returned with an idea, \u201cDad, let\u2019s make hard cider\u201d.  Yes, he thought I was crazy.  Maybe I am.  But why not?  I had a vision.  It all made sense.  Our family had all of the pieces of a puzzle that just needed to be put together.  Dad had grown and managed apple orchards for over 30 years plus he always dares to be different.  He taught us kids to do the same.  Mom & Dad had built successful tart cherry juice business they ran for years.  My brother Rob has a long standing successful career in sales and my sister-in-law Melissa creatively juggled cooking, crafts, and being a mother of three.  All of us were foodies and all of us were passionate about cider. \r\n\r\nWe are farmers, engineers, artists, and entrepreneurs.  Cider was it. \r\n\r\nAnd so, Painted Turtle Hard Cider was born. \r\n\r\nThe vision of Painted Turtle is this:  Be creative.  Move forward.  Take chances.  Live with no regret.  Dare to Drink Different. \r\n\r\nThe Painted Turtle is the Michigan state reptile, so it was fitting that this could represent our local handcrafted product.  But also, Michigan Painted Turtles are\u2026.fearless;  Kind of like our family.  We move forward no matter what life deals us.   This is how we want to live and how we want everyone to live. \r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy our Hard Cider.  It was hand crafted in small batches exclusively by our family using only quality Michigan apples and ingredients.  It was made simply in a classic English style using only the best local ingredients selected by us.  It's fermented slowly for great flavor.  However, be aware: it\u2019s different, it\u2019s unique, but trust me, you deserve to live on the edge.  It very well may be something a little different than what\u2019s out there and what you are used to; I admit that we just decided to design it that way. \r\n\r\nWe know this will be the best hard cider you\u2019ve ever had and we\u2019re not afraid to say it.  From our family to yours, go out on a limb, live creativity, be enchanted.\r\n\r\nDrink Painted Turtle and Dare to Drink Different. \r\n \r\nTracy Loughlin \r\nCider Maker, Painted Turtle Hard Cider","website":"http:\/\/www.paintedturtlehardcider.com\/","established":"2016","mailingListUrl":"info@paintedturtlehardcider.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MiO4CS\/upload_ckDMnS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MiO4CS\/upload_ckDMnS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MiO4CS\/upload_ckDMnS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MiO4CS\/upload_ckDMnS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MiO4CS\/upload_ckDMnS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-03 13:51:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"APGTxX","name":"Main Cidery","locality":"Lowell","region":"Michigan","latitude":42.9336426,"longitude":-85.3419609,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-03 13:53:10","updateDate":"2016-10-03 13:53:10","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YkL3RV","name":"Cozy Sweater","nameDisplay":"Cozy Sweater","description":"this year's version of cozy sweater in an oatmeal stout. malty, roasty, boozy, everything that you should want in a winter beer. on draft only. available until we're done with it. enjoy it while you can. it will be a different beer next year, and every year thereafter.","abv":"4.5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YkL3RV\/upload_vxLaxP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YkL3RV\/upload_vxLaxP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YkL3RV\/upload_vxLaxP-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YkL3RV\/upload_vxLaxP-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YkL3RV\/upload_vxLaxP-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/YkL3RV\/upload_vxLaxP-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:02","updateDate":"2016-11-14 19:36:05","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"ni4EnY","name":"Iron Horse Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Iron Horse","description":"Our story is a lot like our beer; unconventional.

There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character.

The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

A roasted malt character which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"h9Z4OG","name":"Renaissance Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Renaissance","description":"Award winning New Zealand craft beer producer, Renaissance Brewing, is situated in the heart of Marlborough wine country at the top of New Zealand's south island.
