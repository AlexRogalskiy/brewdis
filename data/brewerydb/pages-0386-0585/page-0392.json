The experience is unlike any other you can find in beer.","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8rc5kA\/upload_IYRnlQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:41:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"622Y3A","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"223 North Main","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74107","website":"http:\/\/prairieales.com\/","latitude":36.159253,"longitude":-95.9937507,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:42:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:09","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"IwMl7T","name":"Prairie Artisan Ales Taproom","streetAddress":"3 NE 8th St.","locality":"Oklahoma City","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"73104","phone":"(405) 602-0894","website":"https:\/\/prairieales.com\/okc-taproom\/","latitude":35.4763325,"longitude":-97.5117798,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-07-11 15:20:08","updateDate":"2018-07-11 15:50:43","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"9:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-11:00am-9:00pm,thu-11:00am-9:00pm,fri-11:00am-9:00pm,sat-11:00am-9:00pm,sun-11:00am-9:00pm,mon-11:00am-9:00pm,tue-11:00am-9:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QanhrG","name":"Color Field","nameDisplay":"Color Field","description":"Color Field is a Berliner brewed according to the traditional method, and infused with a trio of botanicals: rose hips, chamomile, and hibiscus.

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer.

Drawing inspiration from beer gardens of Bavaria, we designed Denver Beer Co. to be a place where new and old friends can share a table and pint out of doors.","website":"http:\/\/denverbeerco.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:58:52","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"7LIV1YDQX2","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"anUUVa","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1695 Platte St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80202","phone":"1-303-433-2739","website":"http:\/\/denverbeerco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":39.758265,"longitude":-105.007315,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:49:10","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PgksEp","name":"Colorado Cream Ale","nameDisplay":"Colorado Cream Ale","description":"Light, crisp, and refreshing.

They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hazy IPA, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a 12-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The public can also enjoy the five acres that North Dock sits on with its 18-hole disc golf course that was built in 2015. \r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2019-06-19 15:39:30","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"325VZ4HLFX","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

This Golden Lager delivers the full flavor of a fine import or craft beer, but with a great deal more drinkability. \r\n\r\nOur Golden Lager recipe combines the finest Colorado-grown hops with our prized Moravian two-row barley from the San Luis Valley. Each brew begins with a slow and easy 90-minute boil. Select Colorado-grown hops are added to build taste complexities and balance the malt sweetness.  After fermentation, each brew is crash-cooled to 1\u00b0 Celsius and allowed to rest (lager) for up to four weeks. This Chill-lagering develops each brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden-copper lager that is appreciated for its unmistakable crisp, clean finish.  \r\nBecause of the extra time required to brew, age and package Colorado Native Golden Lager, it take us longer to craft this beer \u2013 we believe you will agree\u2026\u2026..it\u2019s worth the wait.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"27","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-18 20:00:02","updateDate":"2019-07-10 18:17:46","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

The air seems crisper and the snow covers the landscaping like a natural gift wrapping. There\u2019s just no other place like it. And that\u2019s the feeling that inspired Colorado Native Winterfest. It\u2019s our way of celebrating this special time of the year and toasting our friends in Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe began brewing Colorado Native Winterfest back in September. We begin with our prized two-row barley, custom roasted to give the beer its rich, creamy flavor. Choice Colorado-grown hops are added to create the aroma and festive taste. After brewing, we chill-lager the beer to develop its distinctive taste and crisp, clean finish.  Happy Holidays from all of us at the AC Golden Brewing Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of seasonal beers to choose from, but there\u2019s only one that is brewed with 100% Colorado ingredients: barley grown in the San Luis Valley, Colorado-grown hops, Rocky Mountain water and the oldest variety of brewing yeast in the state. The majority of the barley and hops used to brew other Colorado beers comes from out-of-state.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy using only Colorado-grown barley and hops we are supporting the Colorado agriculture community. Our bottles are made in Wheat Ridge, our cans are made in Golden and we do not sell our beer outside of the state: this adds up to a smaller carbon footprint and a great tasting all Colorado beer. Look for the Colorado Proud logo on the beer you buy.","abv":"7","ibu":"24","glasswareId":5,"srmId":21,"availableId":2,"styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7LNm6J\/upload_vn4cCa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7LNm6J\/upload_vn4cCa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7LNm6J\/upload_vn4cCa-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7LNm6J\/upload_vn4cCa-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7LNm6J\/upload_vn4cCa-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/7LNm6J\/upload_vn4cCa-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:32","updateDate":"2019-07-10 18:32:26","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":21,"name":"21","hex":"952D00"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium.
