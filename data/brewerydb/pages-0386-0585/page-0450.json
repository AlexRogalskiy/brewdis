Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, \u201cWhat do you really want to do in life\u2026(when you grow up)?\u201d  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.\r\n\r\nTheir first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff\u2019s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.\r\n\r\nThey evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc\u2026) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult. \r\n\r\nOur roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.  We want to create a place to showpiece our beers, invite your friends and families, and for you all to have a great time.\r\n\r\nThe Salish Sea Brewing Company is the real deal!\r\n\r\nWe have three 10bbl fermenters in place, the 10bbl bright tank, kettle, and mash up and running!  Please join us for a beer soon.","website":"http:\/\/salishbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 04:28:07","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:03:26","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"FJB2P0Z8DV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"RDG0mx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"518 Dayton Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 104","locality":"Edmonds","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98020","phone":"425-582-8474","hoursOfOperation":"Closed on Mondays.","latitude":47.8096929,"longitude":-122.3767578,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","updateDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"11:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"8:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-12:00pm-11:00pm,sat-12:00pm-11:00pm,sun-12:00pm-8:00pm","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Closed on Mondays.","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CvA4S3","name":"Daytona Beach Driver 8","nameDisplay":"Daytona Beach Driver 8","description":"This clean Kristallweizen is spiked with juicy and fresh blood oranges.","abv":"5.2","styleId":49,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-08-26 12:49:36","updateDate":"2019-08-26 12:49:36","style":{"id":49,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Kristall Weizen \/ Kristall Weissbier","shortName":"Kristallweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier without yeast is very similar to Weissbier with yeast (Hefeweizen\/Hefeweissbier) with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast.

We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.

In 2010 we planted our flag in Downtown Fresno, CA and decided to take our journey of becoming the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s local brewery a step further. Our beer and brands reflect the greatness of the region we brew in. We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master\/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.\r\n\r\nAll Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California. We recently renovated our grain warehouse to become a tasting room in a Beer Garden style fashion. Our hope is that the #TSBeerGarden will bring new life to our city\u2019s downtown with an outdoor venue that provides a unique variety of fresh, local craft beer with an urban atmosphere. We host numerous types of events monthly that include live music, art shows, and food trucks. The Beer Garden has regular hours for onsite consumption with bottles, kegs and growlers to go.","website":"http:\/\/www.tioga-sequoia.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 16:26:44","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"wdjaPp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"745 Fulton St.","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","phone":"(559) 486-2337","latitude":36.7314814,"longitude":-119.7881204,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","updateDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","timezoneId":"America\/Los_Angeles","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bgx6wF","name":"DDH Ain't Nothing Nice","nameDisplay":"DDH Ain't Nothing Nice","description":"Double Dry Hopped Ain't Nothing Nice is an IPA hopped with Simcoe, Galaxy and Mosaic then dry hopped a second time with Galaxy pellets and Mosaic lupulin powder.","abv":"6.5","styleId":172,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-08 14:04:34","updateDate":"2019-05-08 14:16:06","style":{"id":172,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Juicy or Hazy India Pale Ale","shortName":"Juicy or Hazy IPA","description":"Color: Straw to deep gold\r\n\r\nClarity: Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers.

A desire to create a balanced and flavorful product at the highest quality possible while contributing our passion to the community that surrounds us has led to the founding of our brewery.","website":"http:\/\/branchandboneales.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8cZbbZ\/upload_ocpx8p-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8cZbbZ\/upload_ocpx8p-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8cZbbZ\/upload_ocpx8p-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8cZbbZ\/upload_ocpx8p-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/8cZbbZ\/upload_ocpx8p-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 16:32:06","updateDate":"2018-12-15 14:04:49","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"62DVY3Q7JI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"FPcBi8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"905 Wayne Avenue","locality":"Dayton","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45410","phone":"(937) 723-7608","website":"http:\/\/branchandboneales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 8:00 PM","latitude":39.7520467,"longitude":-84.1773278,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 16:32:08","updateDate":"2018-08-17 16:32:08","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nFriday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 10:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 8:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xM1IQB","name":"DDH Ella Ekuanot Pale","nameDisplay":"DDH Ella Ekuanot Pale","description":"One keg per account.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
