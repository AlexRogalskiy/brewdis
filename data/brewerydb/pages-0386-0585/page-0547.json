Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"BP3Svs","name":"The Rare Barrel","nameShortDisplay":"The Rare Barrel","description":"We are an all-sour beer company in Berkeley, CA","website":"http:\/\/www.therarebarrel.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/BP3Svs\/upload_rFOJkV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-28 22:16:19","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:33:11","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"W50LJ1YXRI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"eU1BSK","name":"Brewery and Tasting Room","streetAddress":"940 Parker St","locality":"Berkeley","region":"California","postalCode":"94710","phone":"510.984.6585","website":"http:\/\/www.therarebarrel.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.858752,"longitude":-122.2918147,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-28 22:18:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lIi5fS","name":"Entendez Noel","nameDisplay":"Entendez Noel","description":"Like most big Belgian holiday beers, Noel is bursting with subtly complex flavors and fits no particular beer style.

In 1995 he relocated  to Shrewsbury and renamed it Salopian (meaning of Shrewsbury). At that time it was the smallest commercial brewery in the country (not attached to a Pub) with a 2 barrel brewlength.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of trading Wilf Nelson, the current Managing Director joined the brewery. Initially much of the production was contract brewed for bottling \u2013 mainly into Oddbins and Safeways  \u2013  but the advent of progressive beer duty in 2002 allowed the Brewery to concentrate on it\u2019s own cask beer production. Barry left in 2004 and Mark Hill of the Brewers Wholesale became a partner. At that stage the production of the brewery was all into cask, very much in the traditional Midlands style of blonde and lightly hopped. Over this period the brewlength regularly  increased,  firstly to 10 barrels in 2000, then to 15 barrels in 2005 and on to 20 barrels in 2007.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Jake Douglas was recruited as our first salesman, and after a short period he began to influence the production of the brewery as well. A change was made from the traditional  to a more modern hop led style. This transition has proved  very successful, with sales nearly trebling since 2008 and recognition of the brewery\u2019s prowess at every level of competition. A new 30 barrel brewery was installed in 2010 to cope with demand and when this was overwhelmed the brewery relocated in 2014 to a purpose built 50 barrel plant.","website":"http:\/\/www.salopianbrewery.co.uk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Me6YnI\/upload_voaXE4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Me6YnI\/upload_voaXE4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Me6YnI\/upload_voaXE4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Me6YnI\/upload_voaXE4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Me6YnI\/upload_voaXE4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2019-06-12 15:44:28","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"IH6sPy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"67 Mytton Oak Road","locality":"Shrewsbury","region":"Shropshire","phone":"44-(01743)-248414","latitude":52.7068608,"longitude":-2.7870462,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GFNVvP","name":"Entire Buzz Honey Porter","nameDisplay":"Entire Buzz Honey Porter","description":"A strong and malty Brown Porter made with honey to add a slight floral character.","abv":"6.6","ibu":"24","glasswareId":5,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-30 17:07:26","updateDate":"2014-10-16 18:33:25","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Along the way, we\u2019ve made lots of friends and drank our unfair share of good beer, all while trying to do good in our communities and do well as a craft brewery.","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","established":"1998","mailingListUrl":"info@uplandbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:53:19","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"8TCB25H9G6","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"esM0Nc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"350 West 11th Street","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812-336-2337","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","latitude":39.1732971,"longitude":-86.5368625,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2017-10-12 13:33:14","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"E3tJa3","name":"Westside Beer Bar","streetAddress":"4060 Profile Pkwy","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812.336.2337","latitude":39.172339,"longitude":-86.586343,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","updateDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"wed":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"3:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"2:00pm","endTime":"10:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"wed-3:00pm-10:00pm,thu-3:00pm-10:00pm,fri-3:00pm-10:00pm,sat-2:00pm-10:00pm,sun-2:00pm-10:00pm","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qNc7jU","name":"Carmel Tap House","streetAddress":"820 E. 116th St.","locality":"Carmel","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46032","phone":"1.317.564.3400","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/locations\/carmel-tap-house\/","latitude":39.9568182,"longitude":-86.1431514,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:10:54","updateDate":"2016-03-01 19:30:44","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"mon":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"tue":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"wed":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"thu":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"12:00am"}],"fri":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"11:00am","endTime":"1:00am"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"12:00am"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"mon-11:00am-12:00am,tue-11:00am-12:00am,wed-11:00am-12:00am,thu-11:00am-12:00am,fri-11:00am-1:00am,sat-11:00am-1:00am,sun-12:00pm-12:00am","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ShKvsv","name":"Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"4842 North College Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46205","phone":"1.317.602.3931","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm -

Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
