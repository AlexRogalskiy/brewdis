We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:06:13","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"0TCEK1B5X9","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0CZhJD","name":"Double IPA","nameDisplay":"Double IPA","description":"We created this recipe to showcase, first and foremost, the hops.

In our Garage, you can find what drives us \u2014 quality craft beer.\r\n\r\n\u200bEstablished in 2013, we began brewing in what was once an eight bay garage at the end of Old Town Temecula. The brewpub and taproom was aptly named Garage Brewing Co, not only due to its previous life, but to show an appreciation to where the craft beer industry originated \u2014 in the garages of brewers. Here, we have created a family-friendly environment where our fast-fired, Kustom-built pizzas and quality, Kustom craft beers provide unlimited possibilities of flavor while bringing friends and family together. In 2016, we expanded our business and now also have an off-site, full production brewery in Murrieta, CA.\r\n\r\n\u200bFrom the beginning, we set out on a mission: to provide top-quality craft beer that tastes fantastic and appeals to a broad spectrum of beer lovers. We are committed to excellence and only use the finest ingredients, state-of-the art equipment, and top-notch coding processes.\r\n\r\n\u200bWe maintain six core, year-round styles while also regularly rotating in seasonal creations for a total of \u00b1 15 beers on tap at all times.  As an independent brewery, we are free to modify beer recipes and develop exciting and creative spins on standard styles to please all types of beer advocates.  We routinely offer new and interesting beers to bring our customers a truly unique experience. \r\n \r\nOur brewery equipment was manufacured in North America by a company that has built over 350 breweries and has over 25 years of experience in the craft brewing industry. This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves an exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:24:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:47:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"IYX5KUDZEG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"Jki0lE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29095 Old Town Front Street","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 587-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":33.4825051,"longitude":-117.1432478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SEatQn","name":"Double IPA","nameDisplay":"Double IPA","description":"Cyclops spins a multitude of bright hop notes, yet has a lean, dry malt character that brings everything into focus.","abv":"9","availableId":1,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-06-21 19:43:43","updateDate":"2019-06-21 20:30:08","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
