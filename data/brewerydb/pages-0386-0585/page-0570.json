From landing in the welcoming arms of Petaluma, and actually getting our beer into bottles, onto the streets, and into the hands of sympathatic beer geeks, to steadily losing less money each month. From all this and more, Lagunitas Brewing Company is emerging as a battle-tested brewery capable of making great beer out of goat's milk, brambles, and asphalt on the surface of the Moon, if need be.\r\n\r\nAs the poet once said, 'Where, but for the grace of God and the kindness of strangers, go I'.

Since that time, he has fallen in love with beer and brewing and felt compelled to do it professionally, and in 2012, Kenny opened Beer Hound Brewery.\r\n\r\nNot long after Beer Hound opened, friends & beer entrepreneurs Frank Becker & Rick Cash saw the potential in the great-tasting brews that were part of the Beer Hound lineup. They joined forces with Beer Hound Brewery and decided to bring the great tasting microbrews to the Town of Culpeper, Virginia.  In October of 2014, Beer Hound Brewery opened its doors as the first-ever brewery in Culpeper. Local and visiting beer enthusiasts descended upon the new establishment immediately and now the Beer Hound brand is a mainstay of the arts district in Downtown Culpeper.\r\n\r\nAll of the Beer Hound beers are named after famous hounds in movies and history, with an attempt to link the beer style to the hound.

With over a decade of brewing experience behind us, as well as numerous awards, we want to bring the western suburbs a truly unique craft beer experience.  \r\n \r\nWe strive to use locally sourced ingredients in all of our small batch, hand crafted brews.  We love beers that stay true to traditional brewing practices and styles, but also love to mix things up and create something one of a kind.  While beer is our main passion, we also have a deep love and respect for all things craft, so our tap room will proudly feature our favorite local artists and musicians as well as hand crafted food offerings from the Chicago area's finest food trucks.","website":"http:\/\/www.metalmonkeybrewing.com\/","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rq1R2H\/upload_IV0P5e-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rq1R2H\/upload_IV0P5e-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rq1R2H\/upload_IV0P5e-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rq1R2H\/upload_IV0P5e-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/rq1R2H\/upload_IV0P5e-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-28 19:02:29","updateDate":"2018-11-08 23:46:44","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"80KCJ5PQAU","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"bZQoNn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"515 Anderson Drive","extendedAddress":"Suite 900","locality":"Romeoville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60446","phone":"(630) 862-9595","website":"http:\/\/www.metalmonkeybrewing.com\/","latitude":41.6456435,"longitude":-88.0778679,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-28 19:14:05","updateDate":"2017-08-31 18:46:01","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Dt9cXE","name":"Metal Monkey Brewing","streetAddress":"515 Anderson Drive","extendedAddress":"Suite 900","locality":"Romeoville","region":"IL","postalCode":"60446","latitude":41.6446906,"longitude":-88.0780165,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2016","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-01-28 19:18:59","updateDate":"2017-08-31 18:46:02","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"itpjI4","name":"Fantasy Factory","nameDisplay":"Fantasy Factory","description":"Hopheads crusade on a heroic quest for the holy grail of India Pale Ales.
