The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:29:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"R1KWA8UYM3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nCojAV","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"410 James Street","locality":"Ludington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49431","phone":"231-845-2522","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":43.9523739,"longitude":-86.4478298,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SUg5pG","name":"English Mild","nameDisplay":"English Mild","glasswareId":5,"styleId":10,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 12:30:02","updateDate":"2014-12-29 20:03:01","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":10,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Pale Mild Ale","shortName":"English Pale Mild","description":"English pale mild ales range from golden to amber in color.

Family and work obligations and other outside interests drew Jon and Ron away from actively brewing but Rick continued on- and so a true brewer emerged.\r\n\r\nAlways looking for an honest opinion to help him develop the beers he creates, Rick entered competitions in Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin winning several awards along the way.

But stop and talk with Rick about brewing and you will find him very comfortable in a conversation about making beer.

Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and\/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"65","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"12","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.058","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:03"},"breweries":[{"id":"LCt4Wy","name":"Moorhouse's Brewery (Burnley)","nameShortDisplay":"Moorhouse's Brewery (Burnley)","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LCt4Wy\/upload_noFLgh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LCt4Wy\/upload_noFLgh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LCt4Wy\/upload_noFLgh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LCt4Wy\/upload_noFLgh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LCt4Wy\/upload_noFLgh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"0RuI2h","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4 Moorhouse Street","locality":"Burnley","region":"Lancashire","phone":"44-(01282)-422864","latitude":53.7864034,"longitude":-2.2693743,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gkfJxo","name":"English Pale","nameDisplay":"English Pale","description":"English style pale hybrid","abv":"4.8","ibu":"40","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gkfJxo\/upload_SMnlxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gkfJxo\/upload_SMnlxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gkfJxo\/upload_SMnlxm-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gkfJxo\/upload_SMnlxm-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gkfJxo\/upload_SMnlxm-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/gkfJxo\/upload_SMnlxm-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-03-24 15:04:07","updateDate":"2018-03-24 15:05:16","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.
