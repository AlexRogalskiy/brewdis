Lighter and more complex than a stout, this porter has much to offer.\r\n\r\nInteresting Fact: Porter as a style, was first identified in 18th century English pubs. The ingredients made it possible to produce this beer for less cost than a stout, so these beers were named for \"the help\" (the porters). Stouts were generally made for the wealthier people. Traditionally, a stout uses grains which give it a more roasty flavor, whereas a porter usues malts which impart sweeter chocolate or caramel notes. Stouts are known for a fuller body, whereas the porter generally has a lighter mouth feel.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"37","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":19,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Ice Cream, Cheesecake, Chocolate Brownies, Pecan Glaze","originalGravity":"1.058","createDate":"2012-07-15 22:40:23","updateDate":"2015-12-16 17:34:18","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":19,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Robust Porter","shortName":"Robust Porter","description":"Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.

Since I was a child, I spent countless weekends and vacations hiking and camping on the Olympic Peninsula.  Many of the pictures in our tap room are pictures I took, some taken back in my high school days.  The mother of my 4 boys was both Quinault and Hoh Native. My brewery is named after the Hoh Native American Tribe on the north coast of Washington where my son\u2019s maternal heritage dates back thousand of years. \r\n\r\nIt was my grandfather who first made beer during prohibition\u2026and gave me that first spark of interest to make my own beer, giving me some antiquated equipment back in the late 70\u2019s.  It was my wife giving me a \u201cMr. Beer\u201d kit as a gift more recently that really got me going.  Three months after the Mr. Beer Kit, I had already purchased several thousand dollars worth of full grain brewing equipment.\r\n\r\nI had worked with my Father since I was a child, and with my sons, since they were young, in the wood flooring business\u2026establishing a reputation that is respected throughout the entire northwest.  It is that work ethic that my Father taught me; \u201cIt is better to do a job well, even if it means losing money, or may not even be noticed, because the pride you can take in a job well done will last longer than any money you can make.\u201d  It is that work ethic that my son and I carry on into our brewing, using the finest ingredients and taking no shortcuts, to make the finest beer possible, for you to enjoy.\r\n\r\nHoh River Brewery was first licensed as a brewery in the city of Olympia in 2013.

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H05RKIPET3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"25","srmMin":"1","srmMax":"100","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"snQlvg","name":"10 Barrel Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"10 Barrel","description":"We started back in 2006 with three guys and one simple vision.. brew beer, drink beer and have fun doing it.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

The newly assembled Parallel 49 team set out to create the unique brand of Vancouver craft beer that they had been thirsting after for years.","website":"http:\/\/parallel49brewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 23:41:01","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Ixo7Nb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1950 Triumph St","locality":"Vancouver","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V5L 1K5","phone":"(604) 558-2739","website":"http:\/\/parallel49brewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Open from Noon - 9pm daily","latitude":49.2839053,"longitude":-123.0644391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 15:52:39","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Open from Noon - 9pm daily","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eDj1DQ","name":"Dumbstruck","nameDisplay":"Dumbstruck","abv":"6.3","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-22 07:53:27","updateDate":"2016-06-29 20:18:28","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
