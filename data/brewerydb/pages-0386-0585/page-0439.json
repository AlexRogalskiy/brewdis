Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

In year 2001 Rolf Munding purchased the brewery from a local business man and began a program of investment which has rejuvenated the brewery and improved the prospects for the beer, brewery and the people of Zatec, both as beer drinkers and brewers.\r\nTomas Lejsek, one of Czech Republic\u2019s leading and most innovative brew masters has masterminded the changes, bringing together new technology, old brewing processes and pure ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.zatec-brewery.com\/","established":"1801","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-31 11:30:08","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"GOh8Oi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"\u017dateck\u00fd pivovar, spol. s r.o., \u017di\u017ekovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed 81,","region":"\u017datec","postalCode":"438 01","phone":"+420 415 710 783","website":"http:\/\/www.zatec-brewery.com\/","latitude":50.313918,"longitude":13.534263,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-31 11:31:40","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CZ","name":"CZECH REPUBLIC","displayName":"Czech Republic","isoThree":"CZE","numberCode":203,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mDVWws","name":"Dark","nameDisplay":"Dark","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:03","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:51","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"N7CfsS","name":"Champion Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Champion","description":"Charlottesville's fastest-growing production  brewery and beer-drinking Tap Room located at the foot of the Belmont Bridge.","website":"http:\/\/www.championbrewingcompany.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/N7CfsS\/upload_jgHQi2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-27 17:43:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:40:56","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"JWE6I8GSQO","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qCAOOu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"324 6th St SE","locality":"Charlottesville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22902","phone":"(434) 295-2739","website":"http:\/\/championbrewing.tumblr.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday 5-9\r\nThurs-Sat 4-11\r\nSunday 1-6","latitude":38.0279317,"longitude":-78.478483,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-27 17:44:40","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:15","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wednesday 5-9\r\nThurs-Sat 4-11\r\nSunday 1-6","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TO0t9w","name":"Dark & Twisted","nameDisplay":"Dark & Twisted","abv":"6.5","availableId":3,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TO0t9w\/upload_wbVLuV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TO0t9w\/upload_wbVLuV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TO0t9w\/upload_wbVLuV-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TO0t9w\/upload_wbVLuV-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TO0t9w\/upload_wbVLuV-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/TO0t9w\/upload_wbVLuV-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-04 23:40:12","updateDate":"2018-12-20 22:11:44","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not currently available."},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","abvMin":"3.75","abvMax":"6.5","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"zeWbuM","name":"Wicked Weed Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Wicked Weed","description":"Wicked Weed Brewing is based in Asheville, North Carolina.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:22:54","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"HG4KR2WTEI","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"qjZIZq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"900 Kennedy Boulevard","locality":"Somerdale","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08083","phone":"856-504-3442","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","latitude":39.853834,"longitude":-75.019803,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3Pkjx8","name":"Dark Angel","nameDisplay":"Dark Angel","abv":"5","styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-20 15:43:04","updateDate":"2016-06-20 15:43:04","style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more.
