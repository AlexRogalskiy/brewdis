After identifying several neighborhoods to open the brewery, we zeroed in on The Nations neighborhood in West Nashville, TN. We are excited to join those before us who paved the way for local craft beer.\r\n\r\nThe Name: Harding House Brewing Co.\r\nOur name traces its roots back to the nickname given to a house on Harding Place here in Nashville where Nate lived after graduating from college. It is also the place where the inspiration for this brewery originated. Throughout the development process of the brewery, many things changed, but the name remained constant. To the people now involved with Harding House Brewing Co., the name represents more than a single location on a map or a single group of individuals.

With over 14 years of recreational brewing experience, George has won recognition at various local and national competitions, including being a Sam Adams Long Shot regional finalist and a Pilsner Urquell semifinalist.  He\u2019s taking what he\u2019s learned from both home brewing and brewing on professional systems, at Empire Brewing Co. in Syracuse, the FX Matt Pilot Brewery in Utica, and Hopshire Brewery in Dryden, and is creating a unique niche for the brewery in the heart of the Finger Lakes. \r\n\r\n.\r\nKristy Aldrich is our Marketing and Sales Director.  Her background in corporate marketing, retail sales, hospitality, and education gives her a unique set of skills directly applicable to this family business.

As the #1 taste-tester for her husband\u2019s numerous homebrew creations, Kristy has developed a love for craft beer alongside George.  Her marketing and management background prior to teaching, including managing a winery tasting room, has been essential during the early planning of the brewery.  As a Finger Lakes native, Kristy is excited to be \"home\" and thrilled be a part of the tremendous growth in the local wine and craft beer industries. While George continues his day job, Kristy is excited to be running the tasting room, setting up new accounts, and sharing her warm, friendly attitude with our customers.","website":"http:\/\/www.reinventionbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/A6eWhX\/upload_U1XPR2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/A6eWhX\/upload_U1XPR2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/A6eWhX\/upload_U1XPR2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/A6eWhX\/upload_U1XPR2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/A6eWhX\/upload_U1XPR2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:59:48","updateDate":"2019-08-13 16:22:37","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"UF79WNBD56","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"o83NpP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9 North Main Street","locality":"Manchester","region":"New York","postalCode":"14504","phone":"(585) 289-7309","website":"http:\/\/www.reinventionbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: Closed,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 8:00 PM,\nFriday: 3:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 6:00 PM","latitude":42.9698514,"longitude":-77.2303282,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-17 18:59:49","updateDate":"2018-08-17 18:59:49","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Monday: Closed,\nTuesday: Closed,\nWednesday: Closed,\nThursday: 4:00 \u2013 8:00 PM,\nFriday: 3:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSaturday: 12:00 \u2013 9:00 PM,\nSunday: 12:00 \u2013 6:00 PM","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2wuA5d","name":"Dortmunder","nameDisplay":"Dortmunder","description":"This deep golden, strong lager originated in the town of Dortmund, Germany.

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar.

It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 19:29:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"R1KWA8UYM3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"nCojAV","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"410 James Street","locality":"Ludington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49431","phone":"231-845-2522","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":43.9523739,"longitude":-86.4478298,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wFOlUX","name":"Dortmunder Lager","nameDisplay":"Dortmunder Lager","description":"Golden, dry, bready, moderate bitterness","abv":"5.5","ibu":"25","glasswareId":5,"styleId":79,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:05","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:41","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":79,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Dortmunder \/ European-Style Export","shortName":"Dortmunder","description":"Dortmunder has medium hop bitterness.

At the tender age of 13 both knew what they wanted to do for a living... make and drink good beer.  Just kidding!!\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, Pete and Scot spent their formative years playing baseball at the West Middleton Town Hall.  Ever since, the words \"Town Hall\" evoke memories of community, relaxing with friends and happiness.  When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nTucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.  Please come and taste our award winning beer and fantastic food.  Food and beverages are served in our bar, dining room and lounge.  Outdoor seating is available on our spacious patio from April 1 (weather permitting) until the snow flies in
