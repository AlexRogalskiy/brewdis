This historical perspective is maintained at the tavern where commerce is held equal to community. Both being Rapid City natives, Karl Koth and Sam Papendick are the owners and brewers at Hay Camp Brewing Company. After graduating from Stevens High School, Karl moved to Minneapolis to earn a degree in Physics and Sam moved to Fort Collins to earn a degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering (interesting how both locations are craft beer meccas). After receiving their bachelors degrees, they were reacquainted when pursuing graduate degrees from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.\r\nOne evening at a local Rapid City ale house, they began talking about beer and homebrewing. Sam had a great garage and Karl had nearly 10 years brewing experience, so they began brewing beer in Sam's garage almost weekly. Equipment was accumulated, techniques were shared, and plenty of free beer was available for their friends. Karl was finishing his M.S. in Geological Engineering and Sam was in the middle of his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering when they decided to go legitimate. The LLC was formed in August 2012 and they entered the Student Governors Giant Vision Award contest, where they placed third, winning $2500.\r\nIt took nearly a year to find a suitable location, but they finally settled on an unused and beat up garage at the Fairmont Creamery (current location). After six months of renovation, the tavern opened January 1, 2014. The beginning was modest, with a 1.5 bbl brewehouse, a 42 gal Blichman fermenter, and two 1.5 bbl single walled fermenters, but their limited time and production complemented their limited overhead.\r\nKarl received his Masters degree and began working at the US Geological Survey and Sam was still finishing his PhD, so the beer was brewed on the weekends and Friday was the only open night. In August 2014, two additional 3 BBL jacketed fermenters were installed, essentially tripling their production capacity. In January 2015, Hay Camp opened on Thursday nights, where they collaborate with Black Hills Vinyl for live music and bingo.\r\nThe patio opened spring 2015, which expanded seating capacity and overall fun. Patrons could play corn hole, country bucket, or just soak up the nice summer sun. In July 2015, they ordered a new 3 BBL brewhouse and expect the delivery late fall.\r\nLong term, Hay Camp Brewing Company will remain true to it's Rapid City roots. The current plan is to move toward a 10 BBL production brewery and begin distributing to local drafts. Growth is iterative, however, so stay tuned for adaptation post perturbation.","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 14:51:47","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:59:08","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"GNOBI3ZCS7","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"Za6Nem","name":"Hay Camp Brewing Co","streetAddress":"201 Main St","locality":"Rapid City","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57701","phone":"(970) 215 9859","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","latitude":44.079643,"longitude":-103.2200919,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-24 18:07:31","updateDate":"2015-11-20 15:50:05","timezoneId":"America\/Denver","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NyKDbP","name":"Dick the Butcher","nameDisplay":"Dick the Butcher","description":"Dick the Butcher is a no-nonsense pale ale.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze\/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Not to make someone feel as though they are getting whopped over the head with history and facts... the beers...such as \"Old Wooden Head\" (our Imperial IPA... named for Confederate General John Bell Hood...who was a principal player in the battle.. and nicknamed that by this troops for his tenacity)... are made more for the spirit and the feel of the time...mixed with a modern cool feel.","website":"http:\/\/www.burnthickorybrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/kOR0Vy\/upload_ODBfZ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:56:35","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:14:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"ZVPQUDJ0XG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"So1N3d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2260 Moon Station Ct","extendedAddress":"Suite 210","locality":"Kennesaw","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30144","website":"http:\/\/www.burnthickorybrewery.com\/","latitude":34.033027,"longitude":-84.61663,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:57:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vb2bEc","name":"Die Leichtere","nameDisplay":"Die Leichtere","abv":"3.4","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Salads, vegetarian dishes, and poultry.","createDate":"2015-04-02 20:36:03","updateDate":"2015-04-02 20:36:03","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
