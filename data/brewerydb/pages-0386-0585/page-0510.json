Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.\r\n\r\nBrewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety.

Nick graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After graduation, Nick got a call from the Harpoon Brewery in Boston and they were willing to give him a shot. While he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.\r\nSo he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers and beer styles that explore the boundries of flavor. He's probably sitting in front of his brewhouse right now with a beer enjoying what he's doing because he's making beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.doodlebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"bTThBS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"600 Haines Drive","locality":"Liberty","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"64068","website":"http:\/\/www.doodlebrewing.com\/","latitude":39.254543,"longitude":-94.455085,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2017-03-16 15:56:53","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OZahUd","name":"Dubbel Down","nameDisplay":"Dubbel Down","abv":"7.2","availableId":4,"styleId":58,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-02 22:58:16","updateDate":"2013-05-03 01:03:28","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":58,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","shortName":"Belgian Dubbel","description":"This medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale has a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma.
