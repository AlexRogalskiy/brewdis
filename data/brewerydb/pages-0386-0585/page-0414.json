Not content to keep their flavors in liquid form, Northwest Brewing Company also slings a menu of gastropub cuisine\u2013 including BBQ from Brank's, gourmet pizzas and cheese-slathered pasta dishes\u2013 backed by live music every Saturday night.","website":"http:\/\/nwbrewingcompany.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LqF5uF\/upload_YKQYqb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LqF5uF\/upload_YKQYqb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LqF5uF\/upload_YKQYqb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LqF5uF\/upload_YKQYqb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/LqF5uF\/upload_YKQYqb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-21 17:14:13","updateDate":"2019-02-09 19:06:41","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"N","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"M1IYV9PG2O","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"aHlC7p","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"1091 Valentine Ave SE","locality":"Pacific","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98047","phone":"(253) 987-5680","website":"http:\/\/www.nwbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":47.2506709,"longitude":-122.246865,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-21 17:15:07","updateDate":"2018-05-25 14:20:18","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Mon - Thu: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 6:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QUpIyJ","name":"Crazy Brewer Beer","nameDisplay":"Crazy Brewer Beer","description":"Spiced ale brewed with nutmeg, ginger, salt, dark brown and turbinado sugar","abv":"9.2","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QUpIyJ\/upload_Ssvdn2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QUpIyJ\/upload_Ssvdn2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QUpIyJ\/upload_Ssvdn2-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QUpIyJ\/upload_Ssvdn2-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QUpIyJ\/upload_Ssvdn2-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QUpIyJ\/upload_Ssvdn2-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-01 03:36:33","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:07:32","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.

The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them.

It's our goal to continually develop new recipes using our time tested home brewing methods. \"I feel home brewing is the laboratory where true advancement of beer styles is coming from. \"Richard G.

It should be brewed with at least 30 percent rye malt, and hop rates will be low. A banana -like fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; phenolic, clove-like characteristics should also be perceived. Color is straw to dark amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. If the beer is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or light caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"25","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:17"},"breweries":[{"id":"O1ypTG","name":"Great American Restaurants","nameShortDisplay":"Great American Restaurants","description":"In 1974, Randy Norton and Jim Farley opened a 16 table pizza place in Fairfax City, VA.

As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

We support anything from school groups to ski clubs to horse rescue to the mentors program because, well, they support us and honestly it\u2019s the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nDough. We like dough. It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we\u2019ll fill it up!\r\n\r\nWhat, no Coasters? You\u2019d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we\u2019d say \u201check yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!\u201d Let\u2019s conserve together.\r\n\r\nHopefully you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.\u201d But, then again, maybe you\u2019re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down. There\u2019s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We\u2019ll not think less of you. Becoming a soda pop connoisseur takes time.\r\n\r\nFrom all of us at Moonlight Pizza: Kick back, order another beer, enjoy the sunset, and don\u2019t forget your leftovers!
