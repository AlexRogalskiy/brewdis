The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s.

From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:58:17","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"86OJN5RFTV","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"LoZU74","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Hurley Rd","extendedAddress":"Bldg 9A","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","latitude":41.4757351,"longitude":-73.1538361,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2017-08-22 15:37:56","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MMN2IG","name":"Easy Rye-der","nameDisplay":"Easy Rye-der","abv":"7.9","ibu":"78","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 13:41:28","updateDate":"2016-10-08 13:41:28","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

What Charlotte needed was a comfortable neighborhood brewery where folks could drink good beer and meet good people. It didn't take long before an idea was born. \r\n\r\nThe business plan was a homerun and Birdsong Brewing was officially born in 2011. With just two full-time employees, the brewery relied on the help of friends and family to make their dream come alive. In 2015, the brewery moved to a larger facility on the corner of North Davidson and Belmont Avenue near Uptown Charlotte. The operation tripled in size and facilitated exponential growth that brought Birdsong beer to all of the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nWith a 75-watt solar array and a focus on local ingredients, Birdsong embraces a #CanDoWillDo philosophy that guides their creative and sustainable practices. Today, Birdsong Brewing is known for its fresh, unfiltered American-style ales, including their popular Jalape\u00f1o Pale and Higher Ground IPA.","website":"https:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.us7.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=18706afff7b53ba64f88d5f93&id=aefc565443","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2019-07-30 18:30:06","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"A6EI7JOLNT","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.
