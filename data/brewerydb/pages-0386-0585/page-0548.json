Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and\/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:15:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"llbEuB","name":"Unibroue","nameShortDisplay":"Unibroue","description":"There is more to certain beers than simple refreshment.

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H05RKIPET3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"aCW7DF","name":"Eagle Rock Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Eagle Rock","description":"As the first brewery with operations based in Los Angeles in over 60 years, we're dedicated to the production of unique artisanal beers using the best ingredients to promote the ongoing development of the beer community in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nOur microbrewery is attached to our public tap-room, where fellow beer lovers can gather to relax, refresh, and enjoy our unique beers.

Inspired by some of the other small Irish brewers, they eventually decided to try and help do something about it.\r\n\r\nBusiness plans were written, torn up, and written again. Locations were scouted, breweries were visited, and - of course - various different beers were sampled to ensure they were researching the correct product portfolio. Dirty job, but someone\u2019s gotta do it.\r\n\r\nGr\u00e1inne called time on her I.T. career in Jan 2011 to focus full-time on establishing the brewery, while Tim did the honourable thing and stayed put at the day-job to pay the bills. They started brewing their beer at a brewery in Templemore (White Gypsy) while planning the construction of their own brewery in Waterford. Their first beer, Metalman Pale Ale, went on sale in the first week of March 2011, and has been very well received. The brewery took somewhat longer than expected to get up and running, but production eventually moved to Waterford in May 2012.\r\n\r\nThe name of the brewery is inspired by a navigational aid on the Waterford coast. The figure of the Metal Man was erected in 1823 after a military transport ship called the Sea Horse was wrecked off the Tramore coast, resulting in a significant loss of life. The Metal Man stands on one of three pillars overlooking the bay, his purpose to guide seafarers, and keep them on their true course.

From being castigated by our West Marin neighbors to finally suffering an 'eviction' by our West Marin septic system. From landing in the welcoming arms of Petaluma, and actually getting our beer into bottles, onto the streets, and into the hands of sympathatic beer geeks, to steadily losing less money each month. From all this and more, Lagunitas Brewing Company is emerging as a battle-tested brewery capable of making great beer out of goat's milk, brambles, and asphalt on the surface of the Moon, if need be.\r\n\r\nAs the poet once said, 'Where, but for the grace of God and the kindness of strangers, go I'. Where go we indeed, whatever that means.","website":"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/nLsoQ9\/upload_WqZkvw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"Y","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"C0zPjd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1280 North McDowell Boulevard","locality":"Petaluma","region":"California","postalCode":"94954","phone":"707 769-4495","website":"http:\/\/www.lagunitas.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","latitude":38.272435,"longitude":-122.662346,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-12-01 18:56:55","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Wed thru Friday 3:00-9:00.\r\nSat & Sun: 1:00-7:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"g2d9B7","name":"Chicago","streetAddress":"2607 West 17th St.","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60608","phone":"(773) 522-2503","website":"http:\/\/lagunitas.com\/","latitude":41.8579099,"longitude":-87.691899,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-25 12:10:03","updateDate":"2017-06-08 20:31:56","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"s38mA2","name":"Charleston Taproom & Beer Sanctuary","streetAddress":"161 E Bay St.","locality":"Charleston","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29401","phone":"843-853-4677","latitude":32.7784426,"longitude":-79.927534,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-06-08 20:31:56","updateDate":"2018-08-08 15:40:53","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
