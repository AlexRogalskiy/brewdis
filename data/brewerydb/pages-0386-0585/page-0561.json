When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob\u2019s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of \u201cbeer mix\u201d and a bucket to brew.  We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, \u201cOh great, there\u2019s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month\u2019s time.\u201d  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we\u2019re married, I couldn\u2019t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"jNSCVA","name":"Melvin Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Melvin","description":"This is the home of The Melvin Brewing Company.

Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.","ibuMin":"11","ibuMax":"23","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8.1","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:34"},"breweries":[{"id":"MPJbsM","name":"Hanssens Artisanaal","nameShortDisplay":"Hanssens Artisanaal","description":"The visitor center for artisanal lambic beers \"De Lambiek\" is the ideal starting point for discovering the lambic beers, the Zenne valley and the Pajottenland.\r\n\r\nGroup visit with guide (+ 15p) possible after reservation, except on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe center of visitors for the lambic artisanal artisanales \"The Lambic\" is the point of the d\u00e9parto pour d\u00e9couvrir for the lambic bires, the Senne Valley and Pajottenland.","website":"http:\/\/www.delambiek.be\/product\/1139\/geuzestekerij-hanssens-artisanaal","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MPJbsM\/upload_4efPzR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MPJbsM\/upload_4efPzR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MPJbsM\/upload_4efPzR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MPJbsM\/upload_4efPzR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/MPJbsM\/upload_4efPzR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2019-10-23 14:48:34","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"DifSi4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Vroenenbosstraat 15","locality":"Dworp","region":"Vlaams Brabant","phone":"32-02-\/-380-31-33","latitude":50.7288081,"longitude":4.2970459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pwXh4X","name":"Experimental Rustic Lager","nameDisplay":"Experimental Rustic Lager","abv":"5.2","ibu":"25","styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-05-21 14:26:40","updateDate":"2019-05-21 14:26:40","style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Ownership passed to Royal Unibrew in 2001, which merged the Kalnapilis with Tauras brewery in Vilnius into AB Kalnapilio-Tauro Grup?.\r\n\r\nIn April 1996, new fermentation and storage equipment enabled significantly different processing, the result being the introduction of three new brands. The brewery has an annual maximum capacity of 600,000 hectolitres.\r\n\r\nKalnapilis won 2 gold awards at the 2004 World Beer Cup, the Olympics of beer competitions; one in the German Style Heller Bock or Maibock category, for 'Kalnapilis 7.3', and one in the Muenchener style Helles category, for 'Kalnapilis Original'.\r\n\r\nThe brand has a significant presence in sports advertising, and promotes a sporty image.","website":"http:\/\/www.kalnapilis.lt\/","established":"1902","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7j0Yjq\/upload_2qphNv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7j0Yjq\/upload_2qphNv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7j0Yjq\/upload_2qphNv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7j0Yjq\/upload_2qphNv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/7j0Yjq\/upload_2qphNv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"QL72Uk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Taikos aleja 1","locality":"Panevys","phone":"370-45-505223","website":"http:\/\/www.kalnapilis.lt\/","latitude":55.7379229,"longitude":24.3534342,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"LT","yearOpened":"1902","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"LT","name":"LITHUANIA","displayName":"Lithuania","isoThree":"LTU","numberCode":440,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gv0N0N","name":"Export","nameDisplay":"Export","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:22:44","updateDate":"2018-11-06 19:49:55","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

Eug\u00e8ne de Ro brewed his first top-fermented beer in 1898. 4 years later he was also brewing bottom-fermented beers. In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall. They're currently the third biggest pilsner brewery in Belgium.","website":"http:\/\/www.haacht.com\/","established":"1898","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 10:30:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"jfaN0S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Provinciesteenweg 28","region":"Boortmeerbeek","postalCode":"3190","website":"http:\/\/www.haacht.com\/","latitude":50.965154,"longitude":4.60969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 10:53:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8LeXpM","name":"Export Ale","nameDisplay":"Export Ale","description":"Shipyard Export Ale, the flagship brand of Shipyard Brewing Company, is a full-bodied ale, with a hint of sewwtness upfront, a subtle and distinctive hop tase, and a very clean finish.","abv":"5.1","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8LeXpM\/upload_CMEYQx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8LeXpM\/upload_CMEYQx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8LeXpM\/upload_CMEYQx-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8LeXpM\/upload_CMEYQx-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8LeXpM\/upload_CMEYQx-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/8LeXpM\/upload_CMEYQx-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:11","updateDate":"2016-04-04 18:53:46","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins.
