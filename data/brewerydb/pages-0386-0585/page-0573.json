In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

Paired with goat or funky cheeses, roasted meats, or spicy vegetables (or why not all three!), this beer will clean up and refresh your palate with each sip.","abv":"3.8","styleId":69,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LZT8ud\/upload_DUtNit-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LZT8ud\/upload_DUtNit-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LZT8ud\/upload_DUtNit-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LZT8ud\/upload_DUtNit-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LZT8ud\/upload_DUtNit-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/LZT8ud\/upload_DUtNit-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-08-29 20:30:53","updateDate":"2017-08-30 21:16:22","style":{"id":69,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Table Beer","shortName":"Belgian Table Beer","description":"These ales and lagers are very low in alcohol and historically in Belgium enjoyed with meals by both adults and children.

More modern versions of this beer incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to a perception of smoothness. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in barely perceptible amounts, but this is not common. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"8O2BuI","name":"Lost Elm Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Lost Elm","description":"Formerly Bentley Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in Bentley Brewing and the Dark Horse Tavern.

Farmhouse isn\u2019t madly astringent but shows a certain tannic bite. A clean, appetizing finish makes it congenial with food, from the snackiest to meatiest and whole-grainiest.\r\n       Fond of English or Irish commercial ciders? You may like our Farmhouse, though its sweetness is a fraction of theirs. Picture a fresh-tasting second cousin to Magner\u2019s (alias Bulmer\u2019s Ireland), and slash the sugar. \u2018Farmhouse\u2019 is more of a pub cider than our others, with less complexity, and a point less alcohol. \u2018Farmhouse\u2019 is blended from a group of real cider apples that ripen earlier than most. So it\u2019s a bit easier to make and less expensive to buy.\r\n       Farmhouse Cider can seem more bitter and feel more rustic (rough?) than our more elegant blends. You who wince at Farmhouse might find pleasure in our smoother, more complex Semi-Dry. Be aware that none of our ciders is sweet and none is dominated by fresh-apple flavors any more than wines are dominated by fresh-grape flavors \u2026 \r\n     (For the ultimate in tannic astringency, journey to certain farmstead operations in the West of England. Any of their serious bittersweet ciders convulse the oral membranes with eerie power. Ageless residents of rural Somerset or Hereford can chat and sip all day, gently propped against barrels, freed by cidrous tannins from time and harm.

We are proud of Farnum Hill Ciders, and we are authoritatively told that, for now at least, they are the best-made ciders in America.\r\nLet's hope many more Eastern apple-growers will learn the craft and horticulture of cidermaking, and that distinctive American orchard-based ciders, now too rare, will return to their pre-Prohibition glory and variety.

Years passed by and when they returned, their old stomping grounds were almost unrecognizable. Older community spots were shutting down, as new development projects reshaped the places they once knew. A new interest in Oak Cliff, especially the Bishop Arts District, brought more and more people across the Trinity River. During this transformation, they watched as the Craft Beer Movement rippled through Dallas-Fort Worth. As the revitalization of Oak Cliff and the beer-making revolution caught traction, the heart of Oak Cliff was lacking unique craft beer destinations to call home.

These beers may be clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air\/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.","createDate":"2015-04-07 17:21:44"},"breweries":[{"id":"JZUWxh","name":"Badass Backyard Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Badass Backyard","description":"Woman owned, woman brewed.
