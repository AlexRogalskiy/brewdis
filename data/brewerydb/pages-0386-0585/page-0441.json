Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale\/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop\/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"10","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.07","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:31:50"},"breweries":[{"id":"Jpiq8l","name":"Three Taverns Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Three Taverns Craft Brewery","description":"Pushing the boundaries of flavor and style in search of new discovery, we are passionate to promote the culture of the table, where good beer and good people come together in gratitude and celebration, and magic happens.","website":"http:\/\/threetavernsbrewery.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jpiq8l\/upload_EGBu7Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jpiq8l\/upload_EGBu7Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jpiq8l\/upload_EGBu7Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jpiq8l\/upload_EGBu7Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/Jpiq8l\/upload_EGBu7Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:21:05","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4YZ1OCUTA5","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"ovgbBP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"115 New St","locality":"Decatur","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30030","phone":"404-371-1891","website":"http:\/\/threetavernsbrewery.com","latitude":33.7735015,"longitude":-84.2848639,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-08-04 10:51:29","timezoneId":"America\/New_York","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SdS4U1","name":"Dark Engine Stout","nameDisplay":"Dark Engine Stout","description":"Equal parts of roast, black and dark chocolate English malts provide a great aroma and flavor for our full bodied stout.","abv":"6","ibu":"33","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-11 14:35:27","updateDate":"2016-05-11 14:35:27","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"O625LN","name":"Bent Brewstillery","nameShortDisplay":"Bent Brewstillery","description":"Craft brewery and small batch distillery located in the great state of Minnesota.

An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA.

Malt depth maintains a pleasant balance and keeps the bigger alcohol presence nicely integrated.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes\r\n\r\nMalty, bready notes (think pumpernickel without caraway) provide the backdrop to this clean, crisp beer.

We go out of our way to take any pretense out of our beer. We believe in rustic, natural quality over fancy-pants snobbery. Our marketing and branding efforts try to reinforce this and we choose to market by talking to folks instead of blaring messages through mass-market advertising.","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"Y","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/OR1ggJ\/upload_0zGLh5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:33:23","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"lvNMRa","name":"Beaus Brewery","streetAddress":"10 Terry Fox Drive","locality":"Vankleek Hill","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"K0B 1R0","phone":"(866) 585 BEER","website":"http:\/\/beaus.ca\/","hoursOfOperation":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","latitude":45.5177348,"longitude":-74.6374259,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 10:36:23","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"On-site store and tours, open 7 days a week, 10 am to 6 pm.","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xc1M4C","name":"Dark Heron","nameDisplay":"Dark Heron","description":"Expressive IPA released for Emerald City Comicon 2016. 2-row pale, honey and C-15 malts with oats and HBC 438, Mosaic and Chinook hops.","abv":"6.6","ibu":"60","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-05 02:52:21","updateDate":"2016-06-06 18:33:38","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

However, with its flavorful products the company has quickly won innumerable friends outside \u00c5land, and Stallhagen beer is now sold in both Finland and Sweden. Steadily increasing demand and investments in higher production capacity have led to a growth in sales volumes and made the Stallhagen brand well-known to beer-lovers generally, not just the growing flock of experts and connoisseurs.","website":"http:\/\/www.stallhagen.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-22 21:58:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SffK5k","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Getav\u00e4gen 196","region":"Godby","postalCode":"22410","latitude":60.2299259,"longitude":19.9879698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","updateDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","timezoneId":"Europe\/Mariehamn","country":{"isoCode":"FI","name":"FINLAND","displayName":"Finland","isoThree":"FIN","numberCode":246,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BhJSX9","name":"Dark Honey Beer","nameDisplay":"Dark Honey Beer","description":"A beer brewed with some honey and served as an accompanying drink to the medieval style food available at Old Hansa restaurant in Tallinn, Estonia.","abv":"7","styleId":142,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-09-11 14:31:39","updateDate":"2018-09-19 18:51:33","style":{"id":142,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Sweet Mead","shortName":"Sweet Mead","description":"Similar in balance, body, finish and flavor intensity to a well-made dessert wine (such as Sauternes), with a pleasant mixture of honey character, residual sweetness, soft fruity esters, and clean alcohol.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"bjwFtZ","name":"De Struise Brouwers","nameShortDisplay":"De Struise","description":"De Struise Brouwers (DSB) is a small beer company currently located in Oostvleteren, Belgium. In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2019-03-14 13:33:00","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QTpA5f","name":"Dark Horse Stout","nameDisplay":"Dark Horse Stout","description":"A rich and full-bodied oatmeal stout, Dark Horse bristles with bold unbridled taste.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"26","styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QTpA5f\/upload_ryj2CD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QTpA5f\/upload_ryj2CD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QTpA5f\/upload_ryj2CD-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QTpA5f\/upload_ryj2CD-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QTpA5f\/upload_ryj2CD-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/QTpA5f\/upload_ryj2CD-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2018-08-19 01:51:39","updateDate":"2018-08-30 20:48:07","style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"zDKM9Q","name":"Scarlet Lane Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Scarlet Lane","description":"Scarlet Lane Brewing Company\u2019s mission is to be your humble brewer promoting knowledge and continued betterment in the art of beer making.
