At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"},"breweries":[{"id":"l8xFof","name":"Sequoia Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Sequoia","description":"Sequoia Brewing Company Bar & Grill was started in October\r\nof 2003 by Scott and Michele Kendall who purchased Butterfield Brewing Company in February 2000.

You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2\/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer.

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon.

Steadily increasing demand and investments in higher production capacity have led to a growth in sales volumes and made the Stallhagen brand well-known to beer-lovers generally, not just the growing flock of experts and connoisseurs.","website":"http:\/\/www.stallhagen.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-22 21:58:03","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"SffK5k","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Getav\u00e4gen 196","region":"Godby","postalCode":"22410","latitude":60.2299259,"longitude":19.9879698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","updateDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","timezoneId":"Europe\/Mariehamn","country":{"isoCode":"FI","name":"FINLAND","displayName":"Finland","isoThree":"FIN","numberCode":246,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tos50a","name":"Delilah DeWylde - Berry Wheat","nameDisplay":"Delilah DeWylde - Berry Wheat","abv":"5","glasswareId":5,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tos50a\/upload_scMPKn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tos50a\/upload_scMPKn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tos50a\/upload_scMPKn-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tos50a\/upload_scMPKn-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tos50a\/upload_scMPKn-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/tos50a\/upload_scMPKn-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-07 13:21:36","updateDate":"2015-12-16 16:05:13","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners.

Well it started as a business venture Tim basically decided the town and hopefully his pocket needed a micro brewery, (shallow I know, it gets better). Simon wanted in. As Tim had never brewed beer and Simon was a very casual brewer it was deemed necessary that Tim has a basic understanding of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Tim's world was getting complicated... As everything fell apart around them what started as a requirement to start a brewery became a passion that filled days and nights in the shed. Micro brewery plans were put to one side and life went on. We never stopped brewing! Our equipment grew, our knowledge blossomed, books were read courses attended and through the toughest times in our lives brewing was a constant. We created new beers, new flavours, we made beers that will never be repeated and some that never should have existed in the first place.\r\n\r\nYears after our plans for world domination had ended and our brewery had been all but forgotten we realised that we had the tools, knowledge and passion to make this thing happen. Without knowing it was happening we had become beer activists, beer judges and most importantly quality craft beer brewers!\r\n\r\nWe will brew great beer, and we have seen this dream to the end. Tumut River Brewing Co is real!\r\n\r\nI promise, there will always be beer flowing in our shed, if the doors open come have a cold one with us ","website":"http:\/\/www.trbc.com.au\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-13 20:24:32","updateDate":"2018-11-08 18:59:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"3aYI3n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1 - 5 Capper St","locality":"Tumut","region":"NSW","postalCode":"2720","phone":"+61 417 201 663","website":"http:\/\/www.trbc.com.au\/","latitude":-35.2954425,"longitude":148.2153652,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2017-08-23 13:51:05","updateDate":"2017-08-23 13:51:05","hoursOfOperationExplicit":{"fri":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sat":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}],"sun":[{"startTime":"12:00pm","endTime":"7:00pm"}]},"hoursOfOperationExplicitString":"fri-12:00pm-7:00pm,sat-12:00pm-7:00pm,sun-12:00pm-7:00pm","timezoneId":"Australia\/Sydney","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"c1SvWT","name":"Della","nameDisplay":"Della","description":"German-Style Ale brewed with a blend of German malts and hopped with Hallertau Mittelfr\u00fch and Hallertau Blanc","abv":"5.2","ibu":"23","srmId":3,"styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/c1SvWT\/upload_HjLPm5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/c1SvWT\/upload_HjLPm5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/c1SvWT\/upload_HjLPm5-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/c1SvWT\/upload_HjLPm5-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/c1SvWT\/upload_HjLPm5-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/c1SvWT\/upload_HjLPm5-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2019-07-03 18:17:33","updateDate":"2019-07-03 18:18:31","srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).
