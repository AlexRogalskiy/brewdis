Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:56"},"breweries":[{"id":"4cUfa1","name":"Track 7 Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Track 7","description":"The Graham and Scott families established Track 7 Brewing Company as an outlet for creative expression through unique and artisanal beers.

He started home brewing in 1994 after a year abroad studying Linguistics at The Braunschweig Technical University in Germany.  He actually caught the bug 5 years earlier on one of his high school exchange trips to Clauthal-Zellerfeld in Germany.  While on an excursion with the group to London, the father of the family he was staying with served him his homebrewed John Bull.  He would never forget it, but would wait to brew his own until the legal age of 21.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from the University of Oklahoma with degrees in International Business, German and Management Information Systems, he started a 16 year career in the Information Technology business that was very successful.  Many lasting relationships were formed during this time.  Many of his biggest supporters come from this IT family as well as his extended Soccer family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000 he and his wife moved to Tulsa into a home in the Renaissance neighborhood.  They quickly fell in love with its charm, character, neighbors, surrounding shops, accessibility and walkability.  He served as the neighborhood president for 4 years from 2006 through 2010 and ever since as Treasurer on the board.  There are so many things that they liked about living in this part of Midtown Tulsa that when they had kids they renovated their house versus moving to another part of town.\r\n\r\nGlenn continued to dream of becoming a professional brewer someday and was always looking to further his education in the brewing field.  In 2008 while taking a tour of a brewery in Hood River, Oregon he decided to start taking the necessary steps to make this dream a reality.  He began to read anything and everything beer related and of course brewed and brewed.  In October of 2011 the Hall\u2019s founded the Renaissance Brewing Company and purchased a dilapidated commercial property in their neighborhood at 12th and Lewis where they wanted to build the brewery building.  Tulsa\u2019s antiquated zoning laws, however, only allowed breweries in Industrial areas so they had to apply for a zoning variance.  Although this was a delay of over a year, Glenn never lost track of his vision.\r\n\r\nHe completed the Concise Course in Brewing Technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago, Ill. as well as the esteemed International Diploma Program from the World Brewing Academy which is a partnership between the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago and the Doemens Institute in Munich, Germany.  Glenn also successfully completed the Colorado Boy Brewery and Pub Immersion Course with the famous Tom Hennessy in Ridgway Colorado.  Tom will always be his mentor as well as all the other breweries that have helped along the way.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long journey and a long road still to tread, so Prost!","website":"http:\/\/www.renaissancebeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/ofSI0L\/upload_QeB1Cb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:51","updateDate":"2018-11-08 21:59:07","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"P07215MSRB","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"orNo5d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1147 S Lewis Ave.","locality":"Tulsa","region":"Oklahoma","postalCode":"74104","website":"www.renaissancebeer.com","latitude":36.1462265,"longitude":-95.9580406,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-08 08:50:52","updateDate":"2018-01-15 21:29:50","timezoneId":"America\/Chicago","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"o2YlhA","name":"Disel","nameDisplay":"Disel","abv":"5.2","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 01:07:30","updateDate":"2014-10-08 19:07:12","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.","ibuMin":"18","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"6","ogMin":"1.042","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:04"},"breweries":[{"id":"NHgphc","name":"Dueces Wild Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Dueces Wild","description":"Dueces Wild Brewery is a veteran owned craft brewery, who's ambition is to brew high quality beer, support the local economy and present a clean, friendly, social environment for friends and family to gather.\r\n\r\nAlthough we only opened our doors in 2018, we are armed with a brewmaster whose 20 plus years of experience has given us numerous one of a kind recipes and traditionally brewed beers.
