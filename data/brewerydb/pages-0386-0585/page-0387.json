At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:10:04","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"1IB3ZH5NJC","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"Y","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HSfCL9","name":"Coffee Pecan Brown","nameDisplay":"Coffee Pecan Brown","description":"Our Brown Ale base takes on additional character with the addition of cold brewed coffee with pecans.","abv":"6.6","ibu":"30","glasswareId":6,"srmId":26,"availableId":4,"styleId":123,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HSfCL9\/upload_WAokDf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HSfCL9\/upload_WAokDf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HSfCL9\/upload_WAokDf-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HSfCL9\/upload_WAokDf-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HSfCL9\/upload_WAokDf-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/beer\/HSfCL9\/upload_WAokDf-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.064","createDate":"2018-07-19 18:38:38","updateDate":"2018-07-19 19:15:06","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":26,"name":"26","hex":"771900"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":123,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Coffee-Flavored Beer","shortName":"Coffee Beer","description":"Coffee beers use coffee in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"POBUM3","name":"Creature Comforts Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Creature Comforts","description":"Creature Comforts was founded by people passionate for starting a craft brewery in Athens, GA, a town that we love and that has the potential to be a craft beer hub and destination for the South East.  The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:03:29","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"H05RKIPET3","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

We will strive to be a gathering place for beer lovers and support bicycling as a great way to get around our beautiful city.\r\n\r\nPeddler Brewing Company has a 7-barrel brewing system which means it can pump out up to 14 kegs of beer per batch. We plan to have 8 taps in our tap room with a few regular taps and a couple rotating seasonal taps. We also plan to have a guest tap or two of other WA state brews or ciders. Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles\/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat. The bicycle theme will be seen throughout the brewery from the faucet handles in the bathroom to the gears in our concrete counter top.","website":"http:\/\/www.peddlerbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/3OOWRS\/upload_iFC7xX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:44:29","updateDate":"2018-11-08 22:14:14","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"RZT3H4UFKG","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"l6nrGm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1514 NW Leary Way","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"(360) 362-0002","website":"http:\/\/www.peddlerbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":47.663908,"longitude":-122.377033,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-23 14:45:24","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"G8eVNT","name":"Coffee Saison","nameDisplay":"Coffee Saison","styleId":123,"isOrganic":"Y","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-21 21:26:03","updateDate":"2015-07-21 21:26:03","style":{"id":123,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Coffee-Flavored Beer","shortName":"Coffee Beer","description":"Coffee beers use coffee in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character.
