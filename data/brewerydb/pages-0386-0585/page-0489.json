It is from this act the more regularly used reference to \u2018double cross\u2019 comes from \u2013 \u2018going back\u2019 on what was agreed. IPA is a commonly used term in English ale brands and actually means India Pale Ale. It was brewed especially for the British troops serving in India during this time and was typically brewed to a higher level of alcohol and with higher than normal levels of hops. As the journey between the two points took several weeks it was important to apply additional safe guards to ensure the beer arrived in good condition. The extra alcohol acted as an antiseptic and the extra hops as an anti-oxident. Between the two it ensured the beer arrived in India in perfect condition!\r\nDouble Cross IPA is a classic example of this style with a beautifully balanced malt and hop character combined with the special Theakston brewing magic and would be perfect to accompany light curries!","abv":"4.2","availableId":4,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 01:38:35","updateDate":"2017-09-06 16:13:28","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The brewery started with a single iconic beer, still made today, called Prohibition Ale. The hoppy amber beer embodies the spirit of bootleggers and gangsters who persevered when America\u2019s taps ran dry.\r\n\r\nThe brewery quickly gained a loyal following with bold, complex beers, and striking 1920s imagery. In 1999, Big Daddy IPA was added to the lineup and became San Francisco\u2019s best-selling IPA. The beer is still Speakeasy\u2019s kingpin, representing 40% of the brewery\u2019s sales, among a wide array of acclaimed beers, from session ales to bourbon barrel-aged imperial stouts.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years, Speakeasy would open the brewery to family, friends, and beer lovers on legendary Friday nights. Fresh beer flowed from the cold box and live music filled the air. But as the brewery grew, the party space dwindled, and the Speakeasy Tap Room opened in 2013. It now serves thousands of thirsty followers, who can step back in time and relax with a beer, or dip into the medicine cabinet and grab a six-pack to go.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery\u2019s humble beginnings delivering hand-filled kegs out of the back of a van are long gone. Speakeasy now works with more than twenty distributors across the West Coast and throughout the United States. The brewery\u2019s original fifteen barrel brewing system was also replaced in 2015 during a major expansion, which included a sixty barrel brewhouse, centrifuge, malt handling system, canning line, and an additional 1,200 barrels of fermentation capacity.   \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Speakeasy beer brands and brewing equipment were acquired by Hunters Point Brewery, a company founded by former beverage distributor, Ces Butner. Under new ownership Speakeasy Ales & Lagers will grow by leaps and bounds.

At one time the less desirable Fuggles were exported to some areas as \"Fuggle Golding,\" which is probably the source of the name. This hop became the primary hop grown in Styria in the 1930s when their other landrace varieties were severely damaged by powdery mildew.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2018-11-08 20:03:55","isMassOwned":"N","isInBusiness":"Y","brewersAssociation":{"brewersAssocationId":"4T1VLSO75B","isCertifiedCraftBrewer":"Y"},"isVerified":"N","locations":[{"id":"TkT8Rc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","hoursOfOperationNotes":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xUeAIL","name":"Double Diffie","nameDisplay":"Double Diffie","description":"The name says it all.
